"As many Chicagoans were celebrating the Fourth of July with barbecues and after-dinner fireworks, relatives of Natalia Wallace were experiencing the worst day of their lives.
The 7-year-old girl was one of at least 80 people shot, at least 17 of those fatally, across the city during the violent holiday weekend, starting Thursday afternoon. Gunfire erupted outside her relative’s home Saturday on the West Side, and she became the latest in a horrific string of children whose lives have been taken away by gun violence in Chicago.
“Bullets just came..."
"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday again warned lawmakers that the nation was close to exhausting its federal borrowing capabilities - now set for Oct. 18 - and urged Congress to act in order to avert “serious harm” to the economy.
“At that point, we expect Treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly,” she wrote in her latest letter to congressional leaders.
“It is uncertain whether we could continue to meet all the nation’s commitments after that date,” she added in the letter,..."
"The Health and Human Services Department on Wednesday warned U.S. retail pharmacies that they risk violating civil rights law if they deny access to medication used in abortions under certain circumstances.
The HHS Office for Civil Rights said pharmacies cannot deny access to prescription medication used for reproductive health care on the basis of the customer’s sex, pregnancy status and other protected groups under federal discrimination laws.
This may include the prescription of the abortion pill, mifepristone used in combination with misoprostol, to assist with first-trimester miscarriages. The medication can..."
"Federal workers and onsite contractors will have to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or wear masks, practice social distancing and submit to regular testing under sweeping new guidelines the White House announced on Thursday.
The measures are U.S. President Joe Biden's latest effort to spur some reluctant Americans to get vaccinated as the Delta variant of the coronavirus ravages the unvaccinated in particular.
Government employees who do not show they have been vaccinated will be subject to weekly or twice-weekly COVID-19 tests and restrictions on official travel.

"U.S. officials turned away a 17-year-old Palestinian incoming Harvard freshman last week after he was questioned about his friends’ social media posts, according to the Harvard Crimson.
The 17-year-old, a resident of Tyre, Lebanon, was deported about eight hours after arriving at Logan International Airport in Boston and said in a written statement obtained by the Crimson that immigration officials questioned him for hours and searched his phone and computer."
"Topline: President Trump—increasingly a booster of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus—has a “small personal financial interest” in Sanofi, a French drugmaker that produces a brand-name version of the drug—though it’s a tiny investment for the billionaire.
Sanofi produces Plaquenil, the brand-name form of hydroxychloroquine, the New York Times reported; the drug is typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and malaria.
Trump’s three family trusts have investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund, with Sanofi as the largest holding, according to the Times.
Forbes estimates..."
"As President Donald Trump has persistently discussed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, critics have wondered about his motivation, given the drug’s far-from-certain performance on the global stage as a treatment for coronavirus, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal so far to approve it as a treatment for COVID-19.
The New York Times says Trump has a “small personal stake” in Sanofi, the French drug manufacturer that produces the drug.
The report doesn’t say how small, but it notes that his three family trusts have investments in a Dodge & Cox..."
"National Guard troops forced to move out of the Capitol complex Thursday evening have been allowed to return following an outpouring of outrage from lawmakers and the public.
“Brig. Gen. Janeen Birckhead, Inauguration Task Force Commander, confirms that troops are out of the garage and back into the Capitol building as authorized by the USCP Watch Commander and the troops will take their breaks near Emancipation Hall going forward,” according to a statement to Military Times by Air Force Maj. Matthew Murphy, a National Guard Bureau spokesman. “Our troops are..."
"President Joe Biden, whose administration is grappling with overcrowding at migrant facilities on the southern border, tasked Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday with leading efforts to coordinate with Mexico and the Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
The assignment marks Harris’ first major policy role since she was sworn in in January.
“I can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this” than Harris, the president said at the White House. “When she speaks, she speaks for me, doesn’t have to check with me.”..."
"U.S. inflation reached 9.1% in June, its highest rate in nearly 41 years, the Labor Department said.
The consumer-price index’s pace for June eclipsed May’s annual rate of 8.6% that led Federal Reserve officials to shift to a faster pace of benchmark interest-rate increases, according to meeting minutes released last week.
Core prices, a measure that strips out volatile food and energy components, increased by 5.9% in June from a year ago, a slightly slower pace than May’s 6%, the Labor Department said Wednesday. On a month-to month basis, core prices..."
"China launched its military build-up in the mid-1990s with a top priority: keep the United States at bay in any conflict by making the waters off the Chinese coast a death trap. Now, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is preparing to challenge American power further afield.
China’s shipyards have launched the PLA Navy’s first two Type 075 amphibious assault ships, which will form the spearhead of an expeditionary force to play a role similar to that of the U.S. Marine Corps. And like the Marines, the new force will be..."
"The UK has recorded a temperature of over 40C (104F) for the first time - as the heat continues to rise.
Thermometers hit 40.2C at London Heathrow at 12.50 BST, breaking a record temperature of 39.1C in Charlwood, Surrey, registered earlier.
But Tuesday's temperatures are expected to climb higher still, with places along the A1/M1 corridor expected to see up to 42C later.
Scotland is also expected to surpass its historic reading of 32.9C.
In Wales, Rhyl, Flintshire, recorded 33.4C at 11:00 BST.
The Met Office has issued a red..."
"The Department of Homeland Security withheld the release of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies about a Russian campaign to promote allegations about Democratic nominee Joe Biden's ""poor mental health,"" ABC News reports.
Why it matters: The report comes days after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that it will no longer brief congressional committees on election security issues and it echoes allegations from the Trump campaign on Biden's mental fitness. The news is likely to fuel even more accusations from Democrats that President Trump and..."
"The House select committee investigating the events surrounding Jan. 6, 2021, is trying to fill in an hourslong gap in White House call logs on the day a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers said.
The committee is looking into the possibility that Mr. Trump used a disposable burner phone that wouldn’t have shown up in call logs. The Washington Post and CBS News jointly reported that records obtained by the committee show a more than 7-hour gap in former President Donald Trump’s phone logs on Jan. 6, from 11:17 a.m. to 6:54..."
"Lawmakers introduced fast-track trade legislation into the House and Senate Thursday that could pave the way for President Barack Obama to conclude a major agreement with 11 nations around the Pacific.
The bill, the result of a compromise between Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, is expected to escalate an already-bitter fight with some Democrats and labor unions over what could become a key part of Mr. Obama’s legacy. The committee is expected to vote on the plan next week."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday approved remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The antiviral treatment, which is made by Gilead Sciences and sold as Veklury, was used to treat President Donald Trump after he contracted the virus earlier this month.
Remdesivir previously received emergency use authorization from the FDA in May for patients with severe cases of COVID-19. The agency later expanded its emergency use authorization in August to include patients who were hospitalized as a result of their COVID-19 infections."
"White House national security spokesman John Kirby in an interview on Sunday said that President Biden’s remark regarding the “prospect of Armageddon” reflects “the very high stakes that are in play” in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats.
“The president was reflecting the very high stakes that are in play right now, Martha,” Kirty told host Martha Raddatz during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.”
“When you have modern nuclear power and the leader of that modern nuclear power willing to use irresponsible rhetoric the way that Mr...."

She was drinking and bragging about her access to Mr Trump during his holiday in New Jersey, CBS News reports.
Ms Westerhout had worked with him since the first day of his presidency."
"President Joe Biden said on Saturday he will raise the cap on the number of refugees admitted this year to the United States, a day after he drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers for agreeing to keep the historically low figure in place. Biden signed an order on Friday extending a 15,000 refugee admissions cap issued by his predecessor Donald Trump through the end of September. In signing the order, Biden shelved a plan announced in February to increase the cap to 62,500.
Biden told reporters in Delaware on Saturday after..."
"The Senate is on track to vote this week on an expanded version of a bill to address a rise in violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, as a House committee plans work on its own similar legislation Tuesday.
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said on the floor Monday that several proposed amendments to Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie K. Hirono’s legislation would be wrapped into a substitute amendment that would get a vote “in the coming days.”
“We’re seeing that when the Senate is given..."
"The U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases further stretched global supply chains, leading to shortages of goods like automobiles that slammed the brakes on consumer spending.
The weaker-than-expected growth reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday also reflected decreasing pandemic relief money from the government to businesses, state and local governments as well as households. Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production at the end of August also restrained economic growth.
But there..."
"The White House is denying that it's considering a temporary payroll tax cut to help boost the economy after The Washington Post reported that several senior administration officials have been discussing the idea.
A White House official said in a statement that ""cutting payroll taxes is not something under consideration at this time.""
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has not discussed a possible payroll tax cut with the administration, according to a spokesman for the senator.
""At this point, recession seems more of a political wish by..."
"A New York judge has upheld an earlier ruling barring the New York Times from publishing or covering documents written by a lawyer for the conservative group Project Veritas, the Times reported.
Why it matters: The ruling, which now also requires the paper to get rid of physical and electronic copies of the documents, is ""a highly unusual and astonishingly broad injunction against a news organization,"" the paper said in a Friday editorial.
The Times said they would immediately seek a stay and file an appeal. The documents in question were ""obtained legally..."
"The United States plans to send Ukraine advanced long-range artillery that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had requested for weeks, but Biden administration officials said would only be armed with limited-range munitions and would not be used to strike targets inside of Russia. 
White House officials on Tuesday announced that the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, would be part of new $700 million arms package for Ukraine, which has received increasingly more advanced and lethal weapons to fight Russia’s invasion.
“At this time, we've decided not to provide the longer range..."
"The mayor of Portland, Ore., was hit with tear gas Wednesday night after he joined a crowd of protesters who gathered outside a federal courthouse as tensions persisted in the city in response to the Trump administration's deployment of federal officers.
Video shared on social media showed Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) coughing and retrieving goggles as a haze of gas overwhelmed a crowd that was protesting behind a fence located in front of the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse.
Wheeler did not leave his spot at the front of the..."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will organize meetings with an independent group of experts to review data of coronavirus vaccine candidates and advise the agency, FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said on Wednesday.
""The meetings will reinforce the transparency of the process as FDA reviews data from trials now underway,"" Hahn said in a post on Twitter."
"President Trump on Saturday officially nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court, revealing his choice at a Rose Garden ceremony and kicking off a sprint to get the conservative judge confirmed before Election Day.
It was widely reported on Friday night that Barrett was Trump's choice for the vacancy, taking some of the drama out of the president's formal announcement. Now the focus shifts to a looming confirmation fight that is expected to conclude with Barrett becoming the youngest..."
"Daniel Lewis Lee on Tuesday became the first federal prisoner executed in over 17 years, just hours after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against a last-minute attempt to halt the execution.
Lee, 47, a former white supremacist convicted of killing a family of three in 1996, was executed by lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., and pronounced dead at 8:07 a.m., according to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).
“You’re killing an innocent man,” Lee said with his final words, according to a reporter with the Indianapolis..."
"Until Wednesday afternoon, the divide in American politics seemed to be set in high-performance concrete reinforced by tungsten steel rods. That changed when Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) became the first senator in American history to vote to convict a president of his own party.
The word commonly used to describe the virulent partisanship in our politics is “tribal.” But that unfairly disparages indigenous tribes around the world. The divisions have torn apart families and friends. In 2018, when Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) campaigned for reelection, six brothers and sisters attacked..."
"The Republican state lawmakers in Oregon who skipped town this week to avoid voting on a climate bill are reportedly facing fines if they don’t return to the state Legislature soon.
According to a local NBC station, the state senators will be fined $500 for every day they don’t show to vote on the bill beginning Friday. Supporters have reportedly raised over $6,000 to help the Republican lawmakers cover the costs of the fines through a GoFundMe campaign.
Although the bill has already passed the Democratic-controlled state House and..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday essentially reversed earlier COVID-19 guidance by saying fully vaccinated people should now wear masks in certain situations.
The agency said fully vaccinated people should wear masks in ""public, indoor settings"" in areas of the country with ""substantial"" or ""high"" levels of transmission, as defined by the CDC. Those areas currently include much of the South and West.
The CDC also said all adults and students should wear masks in K-12 schools regardless of vaccination status."
"The U.S. may not have ""risen from recession"" quite as rousingly as President Barack Obama suggested in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. Seven years after that severe downturn began, household income hasn't recovered and healthy job growth is complicated by the poor quality, and pay, of many of those jobs."
"Early- and absentee-voting data suggests Hillary Clinton may be benefiting from an uptick in Hispanic voters even as turnout among African-Americans appears to be lagging compared with 2008 and 2012. Donald Trump, meanwhile, isn’t seeing a significant turnout boost powered by white voters, though Republicans are seeing positive signs in several Midwestern states."
"Focus on these new names: BQ1 and BQ1.1.  They are two of the hundreds of subvariants of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus behind COVID-19 that the World Health Organization is tracking.  
These subvariants have shown up in Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Denmark and Italy.  And serious COVID-19 cases are rising around the world, just not in the U.S. yet. But we have been down this road before and we know, by now, where it is likely to lead."
"The Labor Department’s consumer inflation report showed that prices are still jumping.
But as hot as 6.8% year over year inflation is, Friday’s consumer price index report is probably the best the Biden administration could have hoped for at this point. 
While virtually every economist expects inflation to stay high for the foreseeable future, some on Wall Street had worried before Friday’s data release that inflation could have leaped as high as 7% or more in November. "
"Russia on Tuesday announced new military exercises amid a standoff with the U.S. and NATO over Ukraine, which Western officials have warned Russia not to invade.
The newest Russian military drills include short-range ballistic missile units and are being conducted in the western region of Russia, The New York Times reported.

"Russia sees charges brought by the United States against five Russian nationals for alleged sanctions violations as an attempt to intimidate the business community in Russia and abroad, its foreign ministry said on Thursday.
U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday charged the five with sanctions evasion and other violations related to shipping military technologies bought from U.S. manufacturers to Russian buyers. Some of the electronics obtained through the scheme have been found in Russian weapons platforms seized in Ukraine, prosecutors said.
One of the people charged in the case was arrested in..."
"Over the past year, Florida and other Republican-led states have resisted federal measures to curb the COVID pandemic due to concerns over infringing on individual freedoms.
Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers have recently pushed back against what DeSantis has called ""heavy-handed"" COVID mandates, passing legislation to prohibit private employers from requiring vaccines and schools from requiring masks.
George Papadopoulos, a former advisor to President Donald Trump and a conservative author, this week shared an article stating that Florida, which has resisted measures intended to curb the pandemic, is currently experiencing the lowest per capita COVID..."
"Connecticut was more than halfway through a multiyear modernization of its unemployment insurance system in mid-March when the coronavirus pandemic triggered a surge in claims and the state website that accepts applications froze.
Labor department personnel worked all night trying to figure out what had gone wrong and realized the website could only handle up to 8,300 applications in a single day, a fraction of what residents were now trying to submit. After fixing that problem, they tried to figure out what might break next, said Danté Bartolomeo, deputy commissioner..."
"The House on Thursday approved two pieces of legislation aimed at strengthening background checks on firearm sales and transfers, a leading priority for Democratic lawmakers.
The Bipartisan Background Checks Act — spearheaded by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) — looks to “utilize the current background checks process” in an attempt to ensure individuals prohibited from possessing a gun are unable to obtain one.
The bill passed by a 227-203 vote with eight Republicans backing the measure and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden (Maine), bucking his party to vote against it."
"A group of 50 Democratic and Republican members of Congress is due to unveil $1.5 trillion bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation on Tuesday, in an election year effort to break a month-long impasse in COVID-19 talks between the White House and top Democrats.
The Problem Solvers Caucus, which includes members of both parties in the House of Representatives, was set to outline the legislative package at an 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) press conference at the U.S. Capitol.
The group, which says it has been working to find common ground on coronavirus..."
"When U.S. President Donald Trump told supporters in Melbourne, Florida, Saturday evening that ""we've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden,"" public attention turned to the Scandinavian country, expecting scenes of terror."
"Amazon has pulled the plug on Parler, a social media app popular with Trump supporters, in the wake of the deadly U.S. Capitol riot earlier this week.
Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), informed Parler on Saturday that it will no longer provide cloud services to the company beginning on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. PT, according to an email obtained by CNBC. AWS provides cloud services to Parler that host its website, which means that if Parler can’t locate a new cloud provider by Sunday night, the site will..."
"“Not at all,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday when asked if his tweets about the lawmakers were racist. “If somebody has a problem with our country, if somebody doesn’t want to be in our country, they should leave.”
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) is also drafting a resolution to condemn Trump for his tweets. A spokesman for Jackson Lee said that her office is in discussions with House leadership."
"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Monday sentenced five people to death and three more to jail terms totaling 24 years over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.
Saudi Deputy Public Prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan, reading out the trial verdict, said the court dismissed charges against the remaining three of the 11 people that had been on trial, finding them not guilty. None of the defendants’ names was immediately released.
“The investigation showed that the killing was not premeditated ......"
"After Doug Jones won Alabama’s U.S. Senate race in 2017 — the first time a Democrat had won a seat there in 25 years — it seemed as if Roy Moore’s political career was over. After all, he faced allegations that he initiated unwanted sexual contact with teenage girls when he was in his 30s. (Moore has denied the allegations, dismissing them as “fake news.”)
But now Moore has decided to run for the Senate again. On Thursday, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court announced his bid..."
"The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on Friday after the latest U.S. jobs report raised hope the economy is starting to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
The 30-stock Dow jumped more than 700 points at the open, or 2.7%. The S&P 500 traded 2% higher,. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9%.
“We’re back,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on “Squawk Box.” “I think there were a lot of people who felt that the layoffs would be permanent and it’s obvious that there’s so much demand that people have to bring people..."
"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will introduce and vote on a war powers resolution this week to limit U.S. President Donald Trump’s military actions regarding Iran.
“This resolution is similar to the resolution introduced by Senator Tim Kaine in the Senate,” Pelosi said in a statement late on Sunday.
“It reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days.”
The resolution is likely to win approval in the Democratic-led..."
"Political power in the U.S. will shift further to states in the South and Mountain West—with Texas picking up two House seats and California losing one—as the country’s overall population growth slowed to the lowest rate since the Great Depression, the Census Bureau said Monday.
Thirteen states will gain or lose seats in the House of Representatives in next year’s elections through the once-a-decade reapportionment required by the Constitution. They will also lose or gain votes in the Electoral College beginning in 2024.
Besides the double gain for Texas, five..."
"The consecutive terror attacks that killed 224 people on a Russian charter plane Oct. 31 and well over 100 in Paris on Friday have undercut what remained of Western hopes of containing extremists, a goal sought through years of faltering wars in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya.
A day before the Paris attacks, President Barack Obama sounded an optimistic note about the campaign against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria. “I don’t think they’re gaining strength,” the president told ABC News in an interview Thursday. “From the start our..."
"A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday directed a federal judge to drop a criminal case against President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI, handing a victory to the Justice Department and effectively ending the politically charged case.
In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of Flynn and the Trump administration in preventing U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan from exercising his discretion on whether to grant the department’s motion..."
"Despite a stubbornly high unemployment rate of 6.1% in April — representing 9.8 million people who say they are actively looking for work — many employers are reporting that they can’t find people to hire.
Republicans say the $300 a week supplement to unemployment insurance, which for many Americans amounts to a pay raise, is so generous that it is acting as a disincentive for people to return to work.
President Joe Biden, meanwhile, dismisses that suggestion, saying on May 10, “we don’t see much evidence of that.”
“Americans want to..."
"Mykhaylo was one of several hundred men queueing up outside a military enlistment office in Kyiv’s central Lukianivska neighbourhood on Friday, looking for guns to fight invading Russian forces.
He was also looking for a recipient for a donation of 60 bottles that might be used to make petrol bombs: “To, you know, greet the Russians — a big cocktail party”, he said. “A buddy of mine is getting processed machine oil to serve to the Russians.”
As he was speaking, the waiting crowd scattered in panic as someone pointed..."
"Twitter Inc. on Monday accepted Elon Musk’s bid to take over the company, giving the world’s richest man control over the influential social-media network where he is also among its most powerful users.
The $44 billion deal marks the close of a dramatic courtship and a sharp change of heart at Twitter, where many executives and board members initially opposed Mr. Musk’s takeover approach. The deal has polarized Twitter employees, users and regulators over the power tech giants wield in determining the parameters of acceptable discourse on the internet and how those..."
"The U.S. Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, sending the pact to President Donald Trump for signature just a day after he inked a high-profile trade deal with China.
Approved just as the chamber is preparing for Trump’s impeachment trial, senators voted 89 to 10 to pass the deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has repeatedly slammed NAFTA, blaming the 26-year-old pact for sending American jobs abroad, and had threatened to pull the U.S. out of that three-way agreement absent any changes."
"Police reform talks in Congress have fallen apart, as lawmakers could not strike a bipartisan deal despite the loudest calls in years to root out law enforcement violence against Black Americans.
“After months of exhausting every possible pathway to a bipartisan deal, it remains out of reach right now, even after working collaboratively with and securing the support of policing groups like the Fraternal Order of Police and International Association of Chiefs of Police for our proposals,” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who joined in reform talks for..."
"Late Monday evening, a U.S. public health agency expressed concern regarding the newly released clinical trial results from the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
Following the release of promising data showing high levels of efficacy in preventing a COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes, AstraZeneca officials confirmed they would be seeking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) emergency use authorization.
This could be derailed as a public health oversight committee, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) said the clinical trials could have used outdated information in the trials,..."
"The Senate on Wednesday agreed to take up a bipartisan infrastructure package, hours after senators and the White House announced they had reached a deal after weeks of closed-door haggling. 
Senators voted 67-32 to greenlight the debate, with 17 Republicans joining all 50 Democrats to launch a floor effort that could conclude with a Senate victory for a bipartisan package that has been championed by President Biden.

"Boris Johnson has been elected new Conservative leader in a ballot of party members and will become the next UK prime minister.
He beat Jeremy Hunt comfortably, winning 92,153 votes to his rival's 46,656.
The former London mayor takes over from Theresa May on Wednesday.
In his victory speech, Mr Johnson promised he would ""deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn"".

"The Biden administration is increasing the number of Covid-19 vaccine doses shipped to states weekly, sending out 13.5 million doses this week and doubling the number going to retail pharmacies, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.
As of last week, the administration was sending out 11 million doses to states every week. Overall, Psaki noted, the administration has increased the number of doses shipped weekly to states by 57% since President Joe Biden was inaugurated Jan. 20.
Psaki also announced that the White House is doubling the number..."
"California, the country’s most populous state and the center of U.S. car culture, is banning the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035, marking a historic step in the state’s battle against climate change.
The rule, issued by the California Air Resources Board on Thursday, will force automakers to speed up production of cleaner vehicles beginning in 2026 until sales of only zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs are allowed in the state.
The unanimous vote comes after Gov. Gavin Newsom set a target in 2020 to accelerate the shift away from internal..."
"Nine California public school students are suing the state over its laws on teacher tenure, seniority and other protections that the plaintiffs say keep bad educators in classrooms. The case that goes to trial Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court is the latest battle in a growing nationwide challenge to union-backed protections for teachers in an effort to hold them more accountable for their work. The nonjury trial is expected to wrap up in March.
This week a Los Angeles judge will hear a case seeking to deem several statutes..."
"President Barack Obama will celebrate Earth Day by traveling to the Florida Everglades, a trip aimed at highlighting the risks posed by climate change and decrying those who deny the threat.
Wednesday’s visit will be the president’s first to the Everglades, a region the White House calls “ground zero” for the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels in the low-lying area are eroding the shoreline, endangering the landscape and threatening drinking water supplies.
Mr. Obama’s tour of Everglades National Park is part of a broad administration-wide push to show..."
"Six days after a Florida jury acquitted a Hispanic man in the shooting death of an African-American teen, President Barack Obama made his first extensive comments on the case, speaking in personal terms about his own experience of being black in America.
"" Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" the president said in the remarks, made Friday during a surprise appearance in the White House press room. Mr. Martin, a 17-year-old African-American, was shot and killed in Florida last year in a case that riveted millions of..."
"In trying to build a forecast model of the Democratic primaries, we literally had to think about the entire process from start (Iowa) to finish (the Virgin Islands on June 6). Actually, we had to do more than that. Since the nomination process is sequential — states vote one at a time rather than all at once — we had to determine, empirically, how much the results of one state can affect the rest.
The answer in the case of Iowa is that it matters a lot. Despite its demographic..."
"Depending on where you grew up and went to school, you probably learned a different version of the first Thanksgiving.
Generally, it goes something like this: The Pilgrims were facing a rough winter in Massachusetts when a tribe of Native Americans came to their aid, showing them how to plant native crops and forging a future of peace and cooperation between the two groups. In some stories, the Pilgrims gave them something in return (the details vary).
""I think the only way forward is to understand the history the..."
"President Trump dismissed the legacy of the late Rep. John Lewis in an interview with “Axios on HBO,” saying only that Lewis made a “big mistake” by not coming to his inauguration.
The big picture: Trump's comments were a glaring contrast with the praise Republicans and Democrats showered upon Lewis this week, and a default to personal grudges during a week of mourning for a civil rights hero.
Driving the news: In the interview with Axios’ Jonathan Swan, Trump said, “I really don't know” how history will remember the Democratic..."
"When you see “only 6%” trending on Twitter, the next obvious question is “only 6% of what?” Only 6% of dogs wear shoes? Only 6% of cats are plotting to stage a coup d'état in your house? Only 6% of what Tinder profiles say is true?
Nope. Various Tweets were pulling the 6% number from the following passage on the “Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)” page on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website:
“Table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes..."
"On the day Virginia officially voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment earlier this month, becoming the crucial 38th state to do so, I listened to a male colleague explain his opposition to what he deemed ""feminist"" messaging—specifically, a political campaign touting the fact that a woman was first to accomplish something in her field. A ""feminist"" angle, he argued, was anything but persuasive to a general audience.

"Enough women — and men — have chosen political ideology over protecting gender equality, and that’s shameful.
Last week, Virginia became the 38th state to pass the Equal Rights Amendment — which would be enough to finally ratify the amendment. But enough women and men have snubbed it for nearly five decades that now this milestone may already be legally DOA.
“In so many areas, we still have a long way to go,” Democratic Virginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan said.
No kidding.

"The Supreme Court has rejected Arizona's bid to put in place its ban on most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

"Ukraine’s president called on the West to impose a blanket travel ban on Russians, an idea that has found support among some European states but angered Moscow, which pressed on with a fierce military offensive in eastern Ukraine.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s idea looked likely to divide the European Union, where differences on how to deal with Moscow have long persisted between some eastern and western members.
Zelenskiy made his proposal in an interview with the Washington Post as Ukraine halted flows of Russian oil to some eastern European countries due..."
"A U.S. House special election in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district on Tuesday is essentially a do-over after a candidate’s 2018 victory was negated by allegations of illegal ballot harvesting. The election could flip a longtime Republican district, and has shifted national attention to the issue of ballot harvesting, the arguments in favor of and against it, and how different states regulate the practice.
Republican Mark Harris appeared to beat Democrat Dan McReady by 905 votes in the initial election last year, winning a seat in the House of Representatives...."
"U.S. inflation climbed to a 7.9% annual rate in February, another four-decade high, as skyrocketing energy and commodity prices related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed already-elevated costs higher.
The Labor Department’s consumer-price index, which measures the cost of goods and services across the economy, was at its highest rate since January 1982, when annual inflation was 8.4%.
Rising energy prices, including higher gasoline prices, helped push up the inflation reading, along with increases for groceries, restaurant food, transportation services and apparel. Economists expect additional price increases related to the..."
"Inflation across a broad swath of products that consumers buy every day was even worse than expected in October, hitting its highest point in more than 30 years, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
The consumer price index, which is a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% from a year ago, the most since December 1990. That compared with the 5.9% Dow Jones estimate.
On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.

The only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as “eclipse glasses” (example shown at left) or hand-held solar viewers.

"President Obama has hailed the support of Arab nations in air strikes on Islamic State (IS) militants, saying: ""This is not America's fight alone.""
He was speaking hours after the US and Arab allies launched their first air strikes against IS in Syria.
Activists say at least 70 IS militants and 50 other al-Qaeda-linked fighters were killed in the strikes.
US state department spokeswoman Jan Psaki said the US had warned Syria in advance ""not to engage US aircraft"".

"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Retail Federation and National Association of Manufacturers filed a lawsuit in San Francisco against the Trump administration on Tuesday over federal immigration restrictions.
Driving the news: The suit comes in response to the administration's move to ban entry into the U.S. through the end of this year for foreigners on certain temporary work visas — including high-skilled H-1B visas that are relied on by big U.S. tech companies.
""Our lawsuit seeks to overturn these sweeping and unlawful immigration restrictions that are an unequivocal 'not..."
"Ten years into the recovery, the economy’s ability to create new jobs may be slowing both because the U.S. is running out of workers, and also because the trade war may be worrying employers.
Economists expect to see 165,000 jobs were added in June, after a stunningly low 75,000 payrolls added in May, according to Dow Jones. But a soft ADP report Wednesday, with just 102,000 new private payrolls dampened expectations for the government’s June payroll report, which will be released Friday."
"Classrooms are opening this fall, but don't expect it to be anything like a return to pre-pandemic normal. These kids will be bouncing off the walls. They'll squirm in their seats, chat while the teacher is talking, horse around in the hallways, talk back and have a harder time than usual in following rules.

"After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, many survivors became outspoken advocates of gun control. In contrast, Kyle Kashuv became an outspoken advocate of gun rights, appearing on Fox News and speaking at events to young conservatives.
He was set to attend Harvard after a gap year. But the university rescinded its offer, Kashuv announced yesterday, citing a controversy involving racial slurs.

"Gov. Greg Abbott lifted enhanced inspections at one border crossing Wednesday, after Nuevo León Governor Samuel García agreed to establish checkpoints and patrols to prevent unauthorized border crossings into Texas.
But truckers continued to wait hours to cross at the Ysleta and the Bridge of the Americas ports of entry in El Paso. 
Truckers said they usually spend two or three hours crossing into El Paso from Juárez. After Gov. Greg Abbott announced new Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper inspections at ports of entry, truckers this week suddenly found themselves in 10-plus hour lines. "
"U.S. President Joe Biden plans to unveil a sweeping $1.8 trillion package for families and education in his first joint speech to Congress on Wednesday, as he stresses the need to invest to compete with China, the White House said.
Biden will argue that the new package – which together with an earlier infrastructure and jobs plan totals around $4 trillion, rivaling the annual federal budget – is a once-in-a-generation investment vital to America's future.
The U.S. president will also plead directly with lawmakers to pass legislation to curb police..."
"All epidemics trigger the same dispiriting cycle. First, panic: As new pathogens emerge, governments throw money, resources, and attention at the threat. Then, neglect: Once the danger dwindles, budgets shrink and memories fade. The world ends up where it started, forced to confront each new disease unprepared and therefore primed for panic. This Sisphyean sequence occurred in the United States after HIV, anthrax, SARS, Ebola, and Zika. It occurred in Republican administrations and Democratic ones. It occurs despite decades of warnings from public-health experts. It has been as inevitable as the..."
"The Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, according to a copy of an apparent draft opinion obtained by Politico.
Obtained by reporters Josh Gerstein and Alexander Ward, the 98-page draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito is dated Feb. 10, 2022. It is styled as the “opinion of the Court” in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which Mississippi and its supporters have asked the justices to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion that was first established by Roe in 1973 and re-affirmed by Casey in 1992."
"There are certain moments in congressional history that have lived on even longer than the octogenarians who stalk the halls of Capitol Hill. They are the scenes that feel torn from the pages of a political drama: Sen. Howard Baker Jr. repeatedly asking during the Watergate hearings, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” Army lawyer Joseph Welch excoriating Sen. Joseph McCarthy with a rhetorical question during the Army-McCarthy hearings: “Have you no sense of decency?” A panel of tobacco executives testifying one by one before Congress, incredulously, that nicotine..."

Mr. Ellzey’s victory was seen as a repudiation of the power of Mr. Trump’s..."

"The Trump administration is declassifying as-yet uncorroborated intelligence, recently briefed to President Trump, that indicates China offered to pay non-state actors in Afghanistan to attack American soldiers, two senior administration officials tell Axios.
The big picture: The disclosure of this unconfirmed intelligence comes 21 days before the end of Trump's presidency, after he has vowed to ratchet up pressure on China, and months after news reports indicated that the Russians had secretly offered bounties for Taliban militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan."
"President Joe Biden gave a speech in Georgia on Tuesday urging Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, stating that he was ""tired of being quiet"" when it comes to voter legislation.
The president, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, spoke on the grounds of Morehouse College, a historically African-American university, and emphasized the importance of getting the bill passed.

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected former President Donald Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the Democratic-led congressional panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.
The decision means the documents, held by a federal agency that stores government and historical records, can be disclosed even as litigation over the matter continues in lower courts.
Trump's request to the justices came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 ruled that the businessman-turned-politician had no basis..."

"President Barack Obama took swipes at the field of candidates looking to succeed him in the White House, and joked about Congress, Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Donald Trump, journalists and himself in his remarks at the White House Correspondents Dinner on Saturday.
Mr. Obama, enjoying a degree of freedom that comes with being near the end of a second term, was particularly animated when discussing climate change. Playing off a Comedy Central sketch, Mr. Obama tapped his “anger translator” to deride Sen. Jim Inhofe’s (R., Okla.) use of a snowball..."

"In early May a classified CIA update for officers across U.S. intelligence agencies and others with security clearance reportedly cited evidence of a Russian program suspected of paying Taliban-linked militias to kill American and coalition troops in Afghanistan.
The military and intelligence agencies were investigating whether the bounty program might have played a part in an April 2019 roadside bombing near Bagram Air Base in which three Marine reservists were killed. The United States had evidence – in the form of a half-million dollars in cash found in a Seal..."
"Democracies tend to be more effective in speaking to their own people than in communicating with foreign audiences. Part of the reason is that public diplomacy, the practice of engaging and informing the people of other nations, is still considered an elite practice confined to the marble halls of the State Department and foreign ministries.
But public diplomacy — because it is so people-centric — can make the difference between long-term peace and global upheaval.
The death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini for wearing an “inappropriate hijab” has sparked mass protests from..."

If the federal funding bill is not passed by Thursday at midnight, the federal government will face a partial shutdown. The shutdown will mean..."
"Russia has lost at least five generals fighting in Ukraine in less than a month, Western officials said Monday, as communications failures and a lack of discipline among hundreds of thousands of conscripted Russian troops have made it more difficult to communicate orders to the front lines.
The tally of Russian generals killed in the nearly monthlong conflict—most of them one- and two-star commanders, including at least one lieutenant general—is likely the highest death rate among general officers in the Russian military since World War II.

"Russian forces have blown up a bridge linking the embattled Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk to another city across the river, cutting off a possible evacuation route for civilians, local officials said on Sunday.
Sievierodonetsk has become the epicenter of the battle for control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Parts of the city have been pulverized in some of the bloodiest fighting since the Kremlin unleashed its invasion on Feb. 24.

"COVID-19 has brought a raft of intense new stressors while removing many of the resources people have traditionally used to cope with stress. Millions of people have lost their jobs; some have lost their homes or businesses. Families cooped up together because of stay-at-home orders are chafing under the stress, which may increase the risk of intimate partner violence and child abuse. Disrupted routines and the potential for contracting a life-threatening disease may be exacerbating preexisting problems such as mental illness or substance use. At the same time, physical distancing..."

"The numbers: Initial weekly jobless benefit claims rose in mid-August and topped 1 million again, potentially pointing to an increase in layoffs after a summer surge in the coronavirus epidemic or perhaps to more people applying for benefits after President Trump temporarily added $300 in extra federal payouts.
New applications for unemployment benefits, a rough gauge of layoffs, climbed to 1.11 million from 971,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday.

"CHICAGO — Illinois. Gov. JB Pritzker filed an appeal Tuesday after a state lawmaker challenged his coronavirus stay-at-home order and won.
The appeal calls for a reversal of that ruling, and to dissolve Republican Rep. Darren Bailey’s temporary restraining order.
On Monday, Clay County Circuit Judge Michael McHaney issued a temporary injunction so Bailey could disregard the stay-at-home order.
Bailey, a Xenia resident, argued Pritzker did not have the authority to extend his stay-at-home order beyond the initial 30 days. He said the state already has a plan in place..."
"During a speech on Wednesday, President Joe Biden seemingly said he's had cancer. The comment, which was slightly muffled in footage, quickly resulted in a debate about the president's health.

"Germany, France and Italy said on Monday they would suspend AstraZeneca COVID-19 shots after several countries reported possible serious side-effects, but the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was no proven link and people should not panic.
Still, the decision by the European Union’s three biggest countries to put inoculations with the AstraZeneca shot on hold threw the already struggling vaccination campaign in the 27-nation EU into disarray.

Outdoor experiences, access and enjoyment should be the ultimate equalizer. Playing outside, recreating in the wild and enjoying nature should be colorblind,..."

Why it matters: The decision reverses an injunction by a Texas appeals court in March that temporarily blocked such investigations.
The big picture: The court's ruling leaves the injunction in place for the family that originally filed the case's initial lawsuit as the case goes to trial.
The ruling also stated that the appeals court had ""abused its discretion"" by issuing a statewide order.

The Democratic rules package includes the revocation of floor privileges for former members of Congress convicted of crimes connected to their service or election.
It would also make it a violation of the code of conduct for members, officers or employees of Congress to identify a whistleblower."
"Israel has shared intelligence over the past two weeks with the U.S. and several European allies suggesting that Iran is taking technical steps to prepare to enrich uranium to 90% purity — the level needed to produce a nuclear weapon, two U.S. sources briefed on the issue tell me.
Why it matters: Enriching to 90% would bring Iran closer than ever to the nuclear threshold. The Israeli warnings come as nuclear talks resume in Vienna, with Iran returning to the negotiating table on Monday after a five-month hiatus.
State of play: Enrichment..."
"The flow of gas through Nord Stream had already been reduced to a relative trickle. Now, once again, it has been halted completely.
An oil leak, claims Gazprom - which has previously attributed reduced flows through the pipeline to technical issues related to sanctions.
Europe, though, believes President Putin is weaponising gas supplies - deliberately limiting flows through the pipeline to push up prices, in order to test the resolve of Russia’s critics.
The result, as we’ve already seen, is soaring energy costs - with businesses and consumers paying a..."
"Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday that she will suspend her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign and endorsed Joe Biden.
The state of play: While she was one of the final three candidates left in the race, alongside Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Hawaii congresswoman failed to gain traction in any primary and hadn't qualified for a debate since last year.
She did pick up two delegates in the caucuses in American Samoa, where she was born.
What she's saying: ""I know Vice President Biden and his wife and am grateful to..."
"US President Joe Biden has called Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" - when discussing the conflict in Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have previously both accused Russia of carrying out war crimes.
What is a war crime?
It may not seem like it, but ""even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it.
These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements.
Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that..."
"The House of Representatives on Friday passed Democrats' $740 billion tax, health care and climate bill, which now goes to President Biden's desk for his signature.
Why it matters: The bill's passage notches a big legislative victory for Democrats with the midterms approaching and delivers on several longstanding liberal policy goals.
Driving the news: The bill passed 220-207 with all Republicans voting against it.
The details: By far the largest spending provision in the bill is nearly $370 billion to combat climate change, including tax credits and funding for renewable energy, electric vehicles and energy-efficient home improvements, as well..."
"Conservatives have reacted with fury after GoFundMe canceled a fundraiser for Canadian truckers protesting against a COVID-19 vaccine mandate and said it would refund all contributions.
The fundraising effort had raised C$10 million—around $7.9 million—and C$1 million had already been distributed to the organizers of the so-called Freedom Convoy before GoFundMe took the decision to stop the fundraiser.
Truckers have been engaged in a protest in downtown Ottawa for almost a week arguing against vaccine mandates, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling for them to go home but ruling out deploying the army to remove them...."
"Katherine May loves winter, from the cozy comforts of being indoors to the “blustery outdoor stuff.” But she is no great fan of Christmas – or at least the busywork that starts two months ahead of Dec. 25 and leaves her depleted before it even arrives. “I’m quite well known in my family for opening my Christmas cards standing over the recycling bin and just throwing them in,” she says.
Ms. May, author of the book “Wintering,” which is an ode to the fallow season but also treats it as..."
"There are two kinds of inflation. One results from demand growing faster than the economy’s productive capacity, causing the economy to overheat. Call that good inflation, because it is usually linked to a stronger economy. By contrast, bad inflation results from constricted supply which curtails output, driving up prices and eroding incomes, leading to a weaker economy.
Much of the debate over inflation is whether the good sort—i.e., overheating—is about to happen. But investors are signaling that the bad sort is the bigger risk to the economy. As measured inflation..."
"THE FINAL VOTE TALLIES still aren’t known, but the media verdict of this presidential election is in: it’s 2016 all over again. Four years ago, in the hours after Donald Trump declared victory on the strength of 306 Electoral College votes and the ballots of nearly sixty-three million Americans, I wrote a column about the failures of the press throughout that campaign, and declared that “journalism’s moment of reckoning” had arrived. “Reporters’ eagerness first to ridicule Trump and his supporters, then to dismiss them, and finally to actively lobby and..."
"Higher wheat prices should make farmers like Nicole Berg, the owner of a 21,000 acre farm in Washington state, happy. But the costs of fuel and fertilizer are eating into her profits.
“The issue we’re having right now is that input costs are going up even more than the price of wheat,” Berg told CNBC in a recent interview.
Berg, like many farmers, is also constrained by the agriculture equipment market, which has been hit with supply chain disruptions that continue to delay orders of key machinery needed to plant and..."
"Should you still wear a mask in close quarters in a store, a restaurant or a gym if you haven’t been vaccinated? Yes, you should. What if you have been fully vaccinated with two shots of an mRNA vaccine? It’s probably not necessary to mask up but I still would, as a precaution against the very small chance that you could pick up the virus and transmit it to others. 
It turns out the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be aerosolized, meaning that it can hang in the air. Hence, poor ventilation and length..."
"Now that Elizabeth Warren has bowed to the inevitable, the Biden-Bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party…or the typical dust-settling of a conventional race.
That is, one establishment candidate, a veteran, battle-scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting, and an insurgent candidate, a colorful, more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon.
In this view, the voters who gave Joe Biden 10 Super Tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates. Biden was the safe, dependable choice for those..."
"Dominion Voting Systems said in a statement on Friday that it ""categorically denies"" claims that its election software encountered glitches that impacted the results of the presidential election last week.
The company's software is used in 28 U.S. states, including in swing states like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. After official sources called the national race for Joe Biden on November 7, President Donald Trump accused the company of deleting millions of votes cast for him across the country.
Trump posted on Twitter a report from the conservative..."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recalled the terrifying assault on the Capitol in a lengthy Instagram Live on Monday night—clips of which have racked up millions of views on social media.
The Democratic congresswoman from New York recounted hiding in her office bathroom as rioters breached the Capitol on January 6 as lawmakers were meeting to affirm Joe Biden's electoral victory.
She feared for her life, she said, as she heard banging on the walls and a man yelling, ""Where is she? Where is she?""
""This was the moment where I thought..."
"Democratic President Joe Biden and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris have left up tweets expressing support for actor Jussie Smollett after he was allegedly a victim in a racist and anti-gay hate attack that occurred on January 29, 2019. However, on Thursday, a jury found that Smollett lied about the attack.
Biden's tweet reads, ""What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts...."
"Joe Biden’s choice of Neera Tanden to head the White House budget office is setting the stage for the biggest confirmation battle of the president-elect's first weeks in office.
Senate Republicans are vowing to oppose Tanden, a close ally of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who has often slammed GOP lawmakers on Twitter and referred to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as “Moscow Mitch.”
She also hit McConnell on Twitter for not telling President Trump to wear a mask at his daily press conferences and has deleted..."
"When shelter-in-place restrictions eased in May in Gurnee, Ill., Laura Davis’s immediate thought was: When are people coming over? The teacher’s mother and two sisters live within driving distance, she said, and her backyard can accommodate social distancing.
It turned out that wasn’t going to be easy.
Ms. Davis, 38, landed in an argument with her older sister over get-together terms. Her sister and mother have health conditions putting them at risk for complications from the new coronavirus and said they would come only if they could sit outside, if..."
"For families in Uvalde, Sunday brought with it the weight of the most exhaustive account of their loved one's final moments yet. In a long-awaited, 77-page report, a Texas House committee concluded there is not one person to blame, but instead a long series of ""systemic failures and egregious poor decision making"" that allowed the deadliest school shooting in state history to unfold May 24.
The report, reviewed Sunday by The Dallas Morning News, is the second to examine the law enforcement response in the past two weeks. On July..."
"As the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol ramps up its investigation into the events of that day, most Americans continue to say it is important to find and prosecute those who broke into and rioted at the Capitol.
However, since March, there has been a decline in the share of the public saying it is important that those who broke into the Capitol be prosecuted (from 87% to 78%), with the change coming almost entirely among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. 
Since March, there has..."
"A key sticking point in the negotiations over a bipartisan gun violence package being drafted in the Senate has become how states can use grant money in that package.
The framework released Sunday called for grant money to help states implement “red flag” laws, which allow law enforcement and family members to petition courts to temporarily remove firearms from people who show signs of becoming dangerous to themselves or others.
But Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, began suggesting publicly this week that states that don’t have red flag laws — and don’t..."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) created a new political firestorm Tuesday, stating that detention centers housing immigrants are “exactly” like concentration camps and then doubling down in the face of GOP criticism.
“The U.S. is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is exactly what they are,” Ocasio-Cortez said during an Instagram Live appearance on Monday night.
“If that doesn’t bother you ... I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that ‘never again’ means something.”"
"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Three gunmen attacked a luxury hotel in Pakistan’s southwestern port city of Gwadar on Saturday, killing at least one guard and battling security forces from inside the building, security officials and the army said.
Balochistan Home Minister Ziaullah Langove said most guests had been evacuated from the five-star Pearl Continental Hotel, which helicopters circled as fighting was underway. He said there were reports of casualties, but did not give details.
The military said three gunmen killed a guard at the entrance to the hotel when they..."
"The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions on more than 300 Russian lawmakers and dozens of state-owned companies that are connected to the war effort in the invasion of Ukraine.
The announcement came as President Biden met with NATO allies and Group of Seven (G-7) leaders in Brussels to discuss how to respond to the invasion as it stretches into its second month.
""I’m announcing additional sanctions on over 400 Russian elites, lawmakers, and defense companies in response to Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine. They personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies, and they should..."
"CNN has suspended anchor Chris Cuomo indefinitely following new revelations about his involvement in the harassment case against his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).
""The New York Attorney General’s office released transcripts and exhibits Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo’s involvement in his brother’s defense,"" CNN said in a statement to The Hill on Tuesday evening.
""The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions. When Chris admitted to us that he had offered advice to his brother’s staff, he broke our rules and we acknowledged..."
"When the COVID outbreak began in early 2020, a number of studies predicted that government-imposed lockdowns would prove highly effective in preventing deaths. A widely cited epidemiological paper by researchers at Imperial College London predicted that such measures as bans on travel and shelter-in-place mandates would reduce mortality from the virus by 98%. But now, a new analysis by three prominent economists that surveys all empirical data from the academic literature measuring the relationship between death and lockdowns finds that forced restrictions didn’t work. Their conclusion: Lockdowns reduced mortalities by..."
"Last week saw unprecedented mob violence in our nation’s capital and a huge shift in the internet’s relationship with President Donald Trump. Major sites like Facebook and Twitter, which excused harassment and outright threats from the president for years, banned him in a matter of days. The social network Parler, a home for Trump supporters too extreme for those big networks, was banned from Apple and Google’s App Stores and then by Amazon’s hosting services. As of this morning, the network cannot be accessed in any way.
Skeptics have called..."
"Changes in voter turnout in several special elections over the summer suggest Republican candidates are losing their advantage in battleground districts around the country in the months since the United States Supreme Court overturned landmark abortion protections established under Roe v. Wade with their Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.
In New York, Democrat Pat Ryan won a special election in the Republican-leaning 19th Congressional District against Marc Molinaro, a moderate Republican considered to be one of the National Republican Campaign Committee's top prospects in its bid to gain control of the House next year. In the..."
"Crist heads into the General Election at a severe cash disadvantage.
U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist held off a challenge from Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried in Tuesday’s Primary, winning the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Unofficial results from the Florida Division of Elections showed Crist won 60% of the vote to Fried’s 35%. Crist will now face Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Nov. 8 General Election.
“Tonight the people of Florida clearly sent a message,” Crist said in his victory speech. “They want a Governor who cares about them, to solve real problems, who preserves our freedom. Not a bully who divides..."
"That didn’t take long. Less than a month into the Biden administration and already there was a significant, embarrassing and completely inappropriate situation in his press office. And it ended, as it should have — with someone losing their job.
It all started when Vanity Fair’s Caleb Ecarma reported that White House deputy press secretary T.J. Ducklo had threatened a reporter who asked about his relationship with another reporter. Politico’s Tara Palmeri was reporting that Ducklo was in a romantic relationship with Axios reporter Alexi McCammond, who had covered Joe..."
"President Joe Biden’s social spending and climate policy bill has stalled in the Senate, all but extinguishing Democrats’ hopes of passing it this year.
Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat who alone can block his party’s plan, has not signed off on the $1.75 trillion proposal as his party waits to see whether it complies with Senate rules. It means any vote on the bill will likely slip into 2022, when the coming midterm elections will only heighten the sharp political pressure surrounding the plan.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer..."
"The White House is preparing a cabinet reshuffle that would send San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro to head the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to people familiar with the matter. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan would lead the White House Office of Management and Budget.
Personnel decisions haven't been made final, but Mr. Castro is being vetted for the HUD post, these people said. Mr. Donovan has been offered the OMB job, which he has accepted, according to two people familiar with the discussions."
"On 8 November, the US-Canadian border will open both ways to non-essential travel for the first time in 19 months. The closure has kept thousands of bi-national families split throughout the pandemic.
In March 2020, Jaslyn Declercq and her partner, Thomas Musgraves, began to plan their wedding.
The relationship had been a long-distance whirlwind after the pair met in an online chat room in 2017.

"Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra declared Thursday that ""it is absolutely the government's business"" to know people's vaccination status, arguing the federal government has a vested interest in keeping Americans safe.
“The federal government has spent trillions of dollars to try and keep Americans alive during this pandemic,"" Becerra said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""So it is absolutely the government's business, it is taxpayers' business, if we have to continue to spend money to try and keep people from contracting COVID."" "
"The second impeachment of President Donald Trump by the U.S. House of Representatives, for inciting last week’s deadly rampage at the Capitol, could set off a bitter Senate fight that entangles the early days of President-elect Joe Biden’s term.
Trump, whose turbulent four-year term in office is due to end next Wednesday, became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice when the Democratic-led House voted 232-197 on Wednesday to charge him with inciting an insurrection. Ten of Trump’s fellow Republicans joined Democrats in approving the single article..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just before his lawyers stepped into the U.S. Senate to begin their argument that he should not be removed from office, President Donald Trump offered a preview of sorts.
Americans should turn on their televisions, he wrote on Twitter, and watch the attorneys make “our case against” his political antagonists, who he listed with a series of taunting nicknames.
What those who tuned in saw was something quite different.
When Trump’s legal team launched his defense at his impeachment trial on Saturday, they outlined a case far..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a large cross in Maryland known as the ""Peace Cross"" is not in violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause and can remain in place.
The American Legion had built 40-foot tall cross in a memorial park for World War I veterans in Maryland, and a state commission later took over responsibility for the park, including caring for the cross.
But non-Christian residents argued that the government’s care of the cross is in violation of the Constitution’s separation of church and state.
The justices were..."
"Two months after Election Day, control of the U.S. Senate in the 117th Congress comes down to two races in Georgia on Jan. 5. None of the four candidates on the ballot garnered 50% of the vote on Nov. 3, which forced separate runoffs.
In one of the contests, Georgia’s senior senator, Republican David Perdue, is defending his seat against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a media executive and investigative journalist, who ran for a House seat in 2017. In the other, Georgia’s junior senator, Republican Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to..."
"In the current media environment where bitter social media mobs, desperate-for-clicks news outlets and holier-than-thou pundits pile on to criticize and make fun of the Gates, let me take a different stance.
Bill and Melinda Gates appear to be divorcing after 27 years of marriage. Divorces are generally very difficult and personal, and it can only be worse if it becomes a public media frenzy. Just because people are famous or wealthy does not mean that they don’t have feelings and should not be treated with humanity.
Most Americans are..."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on U.S. President Joe Biden to visit the war-torn country in an interview with CNN on Sunday.
""I think he's the leader of the United States and that's why he should come here to see,"" Zelenskyy said.
""It's his decision, of course,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that any plans would depend on the security situation, but that he thought it likely Biden would come at some point.
Washington has reportedly been considering sending Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin or Secretary of State Antony Blinken to visit Ukraine, which,..."
"The Board of Governors for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences met Friday morning to discuss the consequences for actor Will Smith following his slap of presenter Chris Rock during the 94th Oscars telecast, and voted to ban Smith from all Academy events including the Oscars for 10 years.

"After six months of trying wriggle out of his $44-billion agreement to take over Twitter, Elon Musk says he’ll buy the social media platform after all.
On Oct. 4, Musk told the social media company that the deal is back on. In a letter to Twitter, first reported by Bloomberg, Musk said he is willing to go ahead with the deal at $54.20 per share, the original agreed-upon price.
It’s unclear what changed Musk’s mind. Perhaps it was the prospect of a high-profile trial against Twitter, which was due to start in two weeks, or it..."
"The Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg surrendered to authorities on Thursday, as he and Donald Trump's namesake company prepare to face the first charges from a criminal investigation.
Weisselberg, who helped run Trump's real estate empire during his presidency, entered a building housing Manhattan's criminal court.
He and the Trump Organization are expected to be arraigned later in the day, a person familiar with the matter has said.

"Thousands of migrants have converged under the bridge that connects Del Rio, Texas and Mexico's Ciudad Acuña, creating a makeshift camp with few basic services in intense heat in the latest border emergency facing U.S. President Joe Biden.
Del Rio Mayor Bruno Lozano said that as of early Thursday evening 10,503 migrants were under the Del Rio International Bridge, up from 8,200 in the morning.
Food and water has been scarce, around 20 migrants told Reuters, and temperatures have risen to around 99 Fahrenheit (37 Celsius). Reuters witnessed hundreds of..."
"U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse continues to defend his family's membership in the all-white private Bailey’s Beach Club in Newport.
GoLocal interviewed Whitehouse on Friday in Pawtucket and when asked if the private club had admitted any minorities since GoLocal first raised the issue in 2017, Whitehouse said, “I think the people who are running the place are still working on that and I’m sorry it hasn't happened yet.”
Both Whitehouse and his wife Sandra as well as their families have been members of the club for decades. Whitehouse did transfer his..."
"Charges involve cheating on college entrance exams, efforts to bribe coaches; actresses Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin among those indicted.
Federal prosecutors charged dozens of wealthy parents—including prominent law and business figures and two Hollywood actresses—with using bribes, bogus entrance-exam scores and faked athletic achievements to get their children admitted to elite colleges.
One New York law-firm co-chairman allegedly paid $75,000 to an admissions consultant so his daughter could fly to Los Angeles and take the ACT in a private room last December, accompanied by a proctor who had been paid..."
"Democrats took control of the Senate on Wednesday when three new members of the party were sworn in, giving a boost to President Joe Biden’s ambitions in the White House.
The party now controls the presidency and both chambers of Congress.
Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Alex Padilla of California took office, bringing the Senate party split to 50-50. Newly inaugurated Vice President Kamala Harris, who will hold the chamber’s tiebreaking vote, briefly presided over the chamber and swore in the three senators. She laughed..."

"Diplomatic efforts are under way to end renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine.
French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held urgent talks in the capital Kiev, presenting a new peace initiative.
US Secretary of State John Kerry, who is also in Kiev, said the US wanted a diplomatic solution, but would not close its eyes to Russian aggression.

"President Joe Biden held a nearly two-hour phone call on Friday morning with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The call was seen as a critical test of whether Biden can convince China to stay on the sidelines of the conflict in Ukraine, and to turn down Russian requests for military or economic aid.
According to a readout of the call from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xi told Biden that the United States and China each had an obligation to promote peace.
The White House has..."
"With a midnight deadline to avert a government shutdown, the House prepared to vote Thursday on a $1.1 trillion spending bill, in a test of whether Republican leaders can contain late-blooming opposition to some contentious provisions.
House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) told reporters at his weekly news conference that he was confident the spending bill would receive bipartisan support and pass on Thursday, and then be sent to the Senate. Current funding for the government runs out at midnight Thursday. If the bill fails, the House is expected to..."
"President Biden made sure to emphasize that the action he was about to take was extraordinary.
In late March, as the price of gasoline spiked, his administration threw open the spigot of the National Strategic Petroleum Reserve and began releasing a million barrels a day to, in the president’s telling, “provide a historic amount of supply” until domestic production could ramp back up.
But some of that historic supply meant to ease domestic pain, per new reports, ended up overseas. According to Reuters, as gasoline and diesel prices hit record..."
"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in a statement Wednesday that he will object to the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory during the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, alleging that some states failed to follow their election laws and that Big Tech interfered on behalf of Biden.
Why it matters: Hawley is the first senator to say he will object to the certification, joining a group of House Republicans. Biden will still be certified the winner, but the move will force Senate Republicans to go on..."
"Georgia's secretary of state said on Friday that 101,789 ""obsolete and outdated"" names will be removed from the state's voter registration rolls to keep voter files ""up to date.""
The big picture: The announcement comes as several Republican-controlled states, including Georgia, have passed or signed into law legislation that imposes new and often restrictive voting measures.
The removal of the 100,000 names is the first ""major cleaning"" of voting rolls in the state since 2019, although Georgia regularly removes voter files for felony convictions and deaths.
Details: The removals include 67,286 voter files ""associated..."
"President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his Fiscal Year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC.
The new spending will be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030.
Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will..."
"President Joe Biden made an unscheduled visit to the site of a bridge collapse in Pittsburgh on Friday afternoon, during a trip originally meant to tout his legislative agenda — including the landmark infrastructure law he signed last year.
“We saw today, when a bridge is in disrepair, it literally can threaten lives,” Biden said in a speech at Carnegie Mellon University’s Mill 19, just a few miles from the collapsed bridge.
The bridge, said Biden, “had been rated in poor condition for the past 10 years.”"
"The second visit to Pittsburgh of Joe Biden’s presidency — this one touting his administration’s investment into the nation’s crumbling infrastructure — came as the city continued to reel from one of its bridges collapsing Friday morning.
Mr. Biden, a Scranton native, stopped at the site of the bridge collapse in Frick Park shortly after landing at Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin, before heading to Hazelwood’s Mill 19 on Friday afternoon. The Hazelwood visit was planned earlier this week but took on a new importance after the bridge collapse."

Yet north of the border the SNP dramatically almost swept the board.
With all results now declared, the prime minister has won a majority of 80 seats - the biggest Tory majority since 1987.
Meanwhile, at 44%, the party's share of the vote is set to be at its highest since 1979, when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.
Labour, in contrast, finds itself with little more than 200..."
"A new Department of Homeland Security report confirmed by NewsNation sources says that after Title 42 expires next month, migrant encounters could spike by a factor of two or even three times what they are now.
Title 42, the COVID-19 provision used to expel many undocumented migrants who illegally cross into the U.S, is set to expire in May.
In the month of January, immigration authorities had about 154,000 migrant encounters. In February, there were 165,000.
In March, immigration authorities stopped migrants 221,303 times along the Southwest border, a 33% increase from a month earlier,..."
"The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that a Montana policy that excludes religious schools from a general student aid program violates religious freedoms protected under the U.S. Constitution.
The 5-4 majority decision, which fell along ideological lines, said that by making state-backed private school scholarships off-limits to parochial schools, the program ran afoul of First Amendment protections for the free exercise of religion, which prohibits the government from treating religious and secular groups differently.
“A state need not subsidize private education,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “But..."
"As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heads to Washington for a controversial speech to Congress next week, the immediate problem isn’t that he and the Obama administration disagree. At the moment, the problem actually is that they seem to agree on this: As things stand now, the Israeli leader seems almost certain to oppose and try to block the deal the U.S. is negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.
That is a change, and a significant one, from just a few months ago, when i"

The Palm Beach County School Board on Tuesday voted 5-2 to end William Latson's employment at Spanish River Community High School, CNN reported, citing records from the board meeting. Latson had previously been reassigned after revelations about his views of the Holocaust surfaced."
"Democratic presidential hopefuls denounced President Donald Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops back from northern Syria, saying in an Ohio debate on Tuesday he had endangered America’s longtime Kurdish allies while empowering foes Russia and Syria.
In the first Democratic presidential debate since Trump announced the withdrawal, the 12 candidates on the stage were united in painting the Republican president as reckless and a danger to American interests around the world.
But some, including leading progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren, said if they were president they would also seek to end..."
"New Hampshire is one of the last states to hold primaries. But Tuesday's fierce intra-Republican contests will be pivotal in determining the GOP's November fortunes.
The big picture: The outcome of the Senate primary will shape the GOP's odds of winning back the Senate majority. And Republicans could squander two winnable House races by nominating less-electable candidates, at a time when every seat matters for GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy's leadership ambitions.
Why it matters: With weak Senate Republican nominees emerging in other battleground states, targeting Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) has become increasingly important to GOP..."
"The National Industrial Transportation League, the largest and oldest group of rail shippers, has asked congressional leaders to prevent a railroad strike or lockout that could begin as early as 12:01 a.m. on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Class I railroads today reached a tentative agreement with the National Conference of Firemen & Oilers, SEIU, the ninth such deal reached with rail labor since the Presidential Emergency Board issued its contract recommendations last month.
The unions representing locomotive engineers, conductors, yardmasters, and signal workers have yet to reach tentative deals with the..."
"The House Ethics Committee is investigating Representatives Matt Gaetz and Tom Reed over allegations of sexual misconduct.
Gaetz, who's accused of an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old, has vehemently denied that he did anything improper and blames the accusations on a smear campaign. Reed, who is not running for reelection next year, has been accused of rubbing a female lobbyist's back and unhooking her bra without her consent.
Along with investigating Gaetz for sexual misconduct, the committee is looking into allegations of illicit drug use, sharing inappropriate images on the..."
"Well, that was terrible.
During the day’s wild trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by just under 10% in what was the largest single-day percentage decline since the stock market crash in 1987 (when markets were sufficiently scarred to institute failsafe measures for the future, to prevent similar, shocking declines).
Investors shrugged off news that the Federal Reserve was stepping in to offer nearly $1.5 trillion in emergency relief as the major indexes all fell sharply the morning after President Donald Trump addressed the nation to outline..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a fifth call as leaders on Thursday, and Xi warned against ""playing with fire"" over Taiwan, as concerns mounted over a possible visit to Chinese-claimed island by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Chinese state media said Xi told Biden that the United States should abide by the ""one-China principle"" and stressed that China firmly opposed Taiwanese independence and interference of external forces.
Beijing has issued escalating warnings about repercussions should Pelosi - a Democrat like Biden - visit Taiwan, a..."
"Two orthopedic surgeons, a medical office staffer and a patient visitor were killed in a mass shooting Wednesday on the campus of Saint Francis Health System in Tulsa.
The gunman reportedly was able to purchase a semi-automatic rifle just hours before the slayings targeting a specific physician, according to investigators.
Mayor G.T. Bynum and officials from Saint Francis Health System and Tulsa Police Department offered more details Thursday on the shooting that left four innocent people dead, as well as the gunman.
The victims were identified by Tulsa Police Chief..."
"A key panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus booster shots for people 65 years old and older, as well as those at high risk of severe COVID-19.
Driving the news: But in an unusual move, CDC director Rochelle Walensky late Thursday overruled part of the advisory committee's decision and said that workers in high-risk jobs should also be eligible for booster shots.
Why it matters: The approval was a near-final step in making the booster shots available to tens of millions of Americans,..."
"Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Wednesday unveiled a proposal that would subject mobile and fixed broadband providers to utility-like regulations on how they treat traffic over their networks.
The proposed rules would change broadband Internet access from a lightly regulated information service to a more strictly overseen telecommunications service. The FCC would use that new authority to ban broadband provide"
"The number of Americans who filed for unemployment benefits last week was roughly in line with expectations as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the U.S. economy.
Data released by the Labor Department showed initial weekly jobless claims for the week ending July 25 came in at 1.434 million. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected claims to rise to 1.45 million.
This also marks the second consecutive week in which initial claims rose after declining for 15 straight weeks. It is also the 19th straight week in which initial..."
"Crunch time has arrived for the 2020 Democratic presidential field as the second series of debates kicks off tonight in Detroit and candidates look to give their bids a shot in the arm as they push to qualify for the September debates.
While he won’t partake in tonight’s affairs, the attention is squarely on former Vice President Joe Biden as he looks to rebound from a shaky performance just over a month ago in Miami and reestablish himself as the unquestioned front-runner for the Democratic nod to take on..."
"A group of Russia experts urged National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to send more arms to the Ukrainians when he spoke with them ahead of this week’s high-stakes diplomatic meetings with Russian officials, participants told Axios.
Why it matters: By soliciting advice from the hawkish pockets in the foreign policy establishment, including those who served under former President Trump, the Biden administration is considering all options while weighing how to discourage Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine — and punish him if he does.
""It’s always smart to engage with..."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday authorized a second booster dose for people age 50 and older of the two most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines, citing data showing waning immunity and the risks posed by Omicron variants of the virus.

"Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, on Friday said that he is “cautiously optimistic” a COVID-19 vaccine will be ready by the end of 2020 and widely distributed to Americans in the following year.
“There's never a guarantee that you're going to get a safe and effective vaccine, but from everything we've seen now in the animal data, as well as the early human data, we feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this year and as we go into 2021,” Fauci..."
"U.S. listed shares of Sanofi SNY, -0.90% gained 0.8% in premarket trading on Friday after it said the U.S. government will pay up to $2.1 billion for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate it is developing with GlaxoSmithKline GSK, -0.22%.

"The Justice Department's internal watchdog will investigate the secret seizure of data from Democratic lawmakers and reporters during leak investigations initiated under the Trump administration.
The probe follows news of a department decision in 2017 and 2018 to issue subpoenas seeking metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and fellow committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) during leak investigations.
In recent weeks, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also notified reporters at three different outlets their records were sought in similar investigations and dropped the gag orders limiting disclosure of the seizure."
"A rabbi who was injured in the deadly shooting at a synagogue near San Diego on Saturday has described the moment he faced the gunman.
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein says he lifted his hands when he saw the ""murder terrorist"". The man shot and the rabbi lost his right index finger.
One woman died and two other people were injured in the attack.

Trump delivered the remarks to a crowd of a few hundred people."
"A subpoena demanding the release of the full report into Russian meddling during the 2016 election has been issued, amid claims the current version ""leaves most of Congress in the dark"".
Democrat Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House judiciary committee, argued it is entitled to an unredacted version.
Mr Trump's legal team argues it completely exonerates the president.
The Department of Justice has reacted by calling the subpoena ""premature and unnecessary"".
It said it would ""continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent..."
"Igor Danchenko, a consultant whose information comprised the bulk of the 2016 “Steele dossier,” was acquitted Tuesday of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, leaving special counsel John Durham with losses in both cases he took to trial as his yearslong inquiry into the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election winds down.
Over four days in federal court outside Washington, D.C., Mr. Durham sought to portray Mr. Danchenko as fabricating one of his own sources and concealing another one when the FBI questioned him in 2017 about where he obtained the allegations he provided..."
"The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District suspended its entire police department’s operations and placed two top administrators on paid leave Friday morning.
The district’s superintendent, Hal Harrell, in a memo to staff, said the school board would discuss his retirement in closed session when it meets Monday, with no set timeline.
The decision to stop police operations came after parents protested outside of the district’s administration building for 11 days demanding the suspension of all officers who were involved in the disastrous law enforcement response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary..."
"Eighteen months ago, Lorah Trumbatori and Stephanie Rogers were married under the wide Texas sky in a rural county west of San Antonio. 
It was the end of a long, and sometimes difficult, journey. Ms. Rogers is a lesbian and Ms. Trumbatori is trans, and in the years they’ve been together – first in Southern California and then in Texas – their parents had gradually, sometimes awkwardly, warmed to their partnership. Her father is accepting, says Ms. Rogers, though probably not affirming.
But a ride off into the sunset did..."
"US President Donald Trump has cancelled a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying the world had ""lost a great opportunity for lasting peace"".
He said his decision was because of ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" in a recent North Korean statement.
The summit aimed at ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons and would have been the first time a sitting US president met a North Korean leader.
But both sides have recently cast doubt on whether the talks would happen.
Mr Trump's announcement came just hours after..."
"New estimate—half of current presence—comes three months after President Trump’s sought complete withdrawal; proposal would allow continued partnering with Kurdish forces, defying Turkey.
The U.S. military is crafting plans to keep nearly 1,000 forces in Syria, U.S. officials said, a shift that comes three months after President Trump ordered a complete withdrawal and is far more than the White House originally intended.
Protracted administration talks with Turkey, European allies and U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters have so far failed to secure an agreement to create a safe zone in northeastern Syria, part..."
"The US launched a cyber-attack on Iranian weapons systems on Thursday as President Trump pulled out of air strikes on the country, US reports say.
The cyber-attack disabled computer systems controlling rocket and missile launchers, the Washington Post said.
It was in retaliation for the shooting down of a US drone as well as attacks on oil tankers that the US has blamed Iran for, the New York Times said."
"As the political drama unfolded in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, COVID-19 continued to wreak havoc in the U.S., claiming a record of almost 4,000 American lives, the most in a single day since the start of the outbreak.
There were at least 3,963 COVID-19 deaths, according to a New York Times tracker, and another 255,730 cases were diagnosed. The U.S. has averaged 230,610 cases a day for the past week, numbers that are higher than the worst case scenarios envisaged by experts early in the crisis.
There were a record..."
"Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the only African American Republican in the Senate, says reparations for slavery are a “non-starter.”
Scott said Wednesday that it would be too difficult to calculate who deserves compensation and who must pay for the institution of slavery and the years of discriminatory laws that followed its abolition.
“There’s no question that slavery is a scourge on the history of America. The question is: Is reparations a realistic path forward? The answer is no,” Scott said."
"President Joe Biden expressed optimism on Tuesday that most U.S. schools would be open by late spring and vowed to continue accelerating the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program, as he sought to elevate his agenda now the drama of Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is over.
In a wide-ranging televised town hall that touched on the pandemic, economic relief, China-U.S. relations and race and policing, Biden also aimed to build public support for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, which is awaiting congressional action.
“Now’s the time to go big,” he said..."
"Congress will convene for a joint session Wednesday to tally electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election in one of the last formalities before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
But the normally routine proceedings promise to be a tense affair this time around as dozens of GOP lawmakers have vowed to challenge the election results.
The Electoral College voted last month 306 to 232 to elect Biden as the 46th president of the United States, but Congress needs to record those votes before he can be sworn..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Monday granting Russian citizenship to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
Driving the news: Snowden fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia after revealing classified documents about the U.S. government's mass surveillance program in 2013.
Snowden was granted permanent residency in Russia in October 2020, but his lawyers said at the time that he was not considering applying for Russian citizenship."
"WASHINGTON – A majority of the House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to impeach President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. The vote marked only the third time in American history that the full chamber has approved articles of impeachment against a president.
The largely party-line vote represented the culmination of a sprawling three-month investigation that was conducted by multiple committees in the Democratic-controlled House, and which was opposed at every turn by the White House and congressional Republicans."
"Former President Donald Trump has decided whether or not he will run for president in 2024, according to New York magazine, telling the outlet in an interview that his ""big decision"" at this point is whether to make an announcement before or after the midterms--an issue that is reportedly a point of contention among his advisors.
Trump did not state whether he will run or not, but told New York: “I feel very confident that, if I decide to run, I’ll win.”
Trump said he’s not sure when he will..."
"It has been unclear whether former President Donald Trump will run in the 2024 presidential election — until now.
Driving the news: In a recent interview with New York Magazine, Trump said he was still deciding when, not if, to announce his campaign.
“I would say my big decision will be whether I go before or after,” Trump said in an interview with Olivia Nuzzi, referring to the midterm elections in November."
"President-elect Joe Biden pleaded with Americans on Wednesday to take steps to remain safe over the Thanksgiving holiday as COVID-19 cases soar, while President Donald Trump pardoned a former aide who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Biden gave a presidential-style speech acknowledging people’s fatigue with restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, but urged them to exercise caution as caseloads surge.
“I know the country has grown weary of the fight. We need to remember - we’re at war with the virus, not with one another,” Biden said as..."
"When he ran for president in 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would vote to end the constitutional right to an abortion. During his four years in office, Trump placed three justices – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett – on the court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority. With that majority in place, conservatives hope, and liberals fear, that the court will renounce nearly five decades of abortion jurisprudence and overturn the landmark rulings of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health..."
"This week’s primaries are a gamble — and not just because many of them are in Nevada. Former President Donald Trump is backing challengers to not one but two incumbent members of Congress, which will once again put the power of his endorsement to the test. Meanwhile, both parties face decisions about how far right or left of center a nominee can be in a swing seat and still stand a chance of winning in November.
All told, four states are holding primaries on Tuesday: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday voted 5-4 to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion measure in a major win for reproductive rights activists, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court’s four liberals.
Justice Stephen Breyer, who authored an opinion joined by his fellow Democratic appointees, wrote that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. Roberts wrote separately to say his thinking was based on the court’s 2016 decision to strike down a similar law in Texas.
The case involved a Louisiana abortion law requiring..."
"The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced it would seek to block irregular migration from Venezuela by expanding a Trump-era policy and kicking off a new program for Venezuelans fleeing the country.
The new program is modeled off of the Uniting for Ukraine program that allowed people in the U.S. to privately sponsor Ukrainians, in this case allowing up to 24,000 Venezuelans to secure a work authorization for up to two years.
But along with the new program, the U.S. said it will now expel Venezuelans who cross the border from Mexico, extending..."
"President Biden wrapped a two-hour video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday during which the U.S. president warned Moscow against invading Ukraine.
The White House said in a subsequent readout that Biden “voiced the deep concerns of the United States and our European Allies about Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine and made clear that the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.”
“President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return..."
"The nation’s capital will mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day with a march for voting rights led by the late civil rights leader’s family, as congressional Democrats vow to press ahead on voting-rights legislation despite its expected failure.
The leaders of the march are urging people to call on Congress to enact changes to elections law nationwide in lieu of celebrations on the federal holiday dedicated to Dr. King’s birthday.
The Senate is scheduled to begin debate on voting legislation this week, but Republicans are expected to block passage despite all Democrats being united..."
"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio entered the crowded 2020 presidential race on Thursday, arguing that his record of progressive accomplishments in the country’s biggest city positioned him as the perfect foil to President Donald Trump.
De Blasio, 57, launched his candidacy with the central campaign message, “Working People First,” becoming the 24th Democrat seeking to take on Trump in the election next year.
In a video released on Thursday, de Blasio returned to the theme of income inequality that had animated his first mayoral campaign in 2013, when..."
"Voting got off to a glitchy start in Maricopa County on Tuesday morning because of widespread issues with the machines that count voters' ballots. 
All of the county's 223 voting locations opened on time, but an hour into the election, voters and poll workers at some sites started reporting issues with tabulators.
Officials confirmed those problems during an impromptu Tuesday morning news conference. 
""After people have voted (their ballot), they try to run them through the tabulator, and they're not going through,"" Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said.
Voters have the option..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a move aimed at dividing Democrats, set a vote for Tuesday on their “Green New Deal” resolution that seeks to cut greenhouse gas emissions by moving off fossil fuels.
The Green New Deal, introduced last month by Democrats, marked the first formal attempt by lawmakers to define legislation to create big government-led investments in clean energy like wind and solar power, infrastructure and social programs.
The goal of the non-binding resolution is to speed a transition of the U.S. economy away from burning fossil..."
"Democratic White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg surged to a 10-point lead in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary, according to a new Saint Anselm College poll released Tuesday.
Buttigieg gets the support of 25 percent of self-identified likely Democratic primary voters, marking the first time the South Bend, Ind., mayor has emerged atop a poll in the Granite State. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are tied for second at 15 percent, while no other candidate breaks double digits. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sits in third place..."
"Arkansas lawmakers voted Wednesday to bar most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, overriding a veto by the state's governor to set the most-stringent abortion restrictions in the nation.
The Arkansas House of Representatives voted 56 to 33 to enact the legislation, a day after the Senate voted 20 to 14 in favor of overruling Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans, although six Democratic representatives were among the House members who voted to uphold the measure.
""If I say that I'm pro-life, at some point I..."
"The Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan Tuesday, a huge step for Democrats as they try to push President Joe Biden’s sweeping economic agenda through Congress.
The legislation, which includes $550 billion in new funding for transportation, broadband and utilities, got through in a 69-30 vote, as 19 Republicans joined all 50 Democrats. The chamber in a 50-49 party line vote then proceeded to a budget resolution that would allow Democrats to approve what they see as a complementary $3.5 trillion spending plan without Republican votes.
“Today, the Senate takes a decades overdue step to..."
"Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner on Tuesday defended messages to colleagues published in the Washington Post that seemed to show Döpfner supporting Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election, arguing they were taken out of context.
Why it matters: Axel Springer is trying to position itself as a centrist publisher amid a U.S. media investment spree, but the company's history and recent headlines suggest a culture gap may remain between the German publishing giant and U.S. media.
Döpfner has ""never tried to influence journalists"" who work for him, he said..."
"Billionaire businessman, philanthropist and independent presidential candidate Ross Perot is dead at 89, CNBC has confirmed.
Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996, died after a five-month battle with leukemia, said James Fuller, a representative for the Perot family.
“In business and in life, Ross was a man of integrity and action. A true American patriot and a man of rare vision, principle and deep compassion, he touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors,” Fuller..."
"Ukrainian officials and independent photographers have reported bodies strewn in the streets of the Kyiv region city of Bucha, after Ukrainian forces retook the area following a Russian retreat to eastern Ukraine.
The big picture: Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk tweeted Saturday images of bodies with hands tied behind their backs in the city, northwest of Kyiv. ""We have already buried 280 people in mass graves,"" he told AFP, which also captured images of bodies in Bucha's streets.
""These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat,"" Fedoruk said in his..."
"Here in the nation's capital, the question of the moment is whether the rise of the Islamic State extremist group has changed President Barack Obama's reluctance to re-engage in Iraq militarily, or to really intervene for the first time in Syria—and that certainly is an important question.
But equally important and far less discussed is this: Has the specter of a new, different and frightening kind of Islamic extremism changed the American public's deep reluctance to engage anew in the Middle East?
Privately, some administration offi"
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will no longer recommend masking indoors, schools included—except in areas with high levels of severe Covid cases—in order to “give people a break from mask-wearing” in lower-risk areas, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky announced Friday.
The CDC has updated its framework for monitoring communities’ Covid levels, focusing less on overall case numbers and more on numbers of severe cases, in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, Walensky said.
The CDC will continue to recommend wearing masks indoors in public spaces, including in..."
"Fewer workers sought jobless benefits in the US last week than at any time since 1969.
Just 187,000 people filed for unemployment, the Labor Department reported. That was down roughly 28,000 from the previous week.
The figures show a stark turnaround in the job market in the US since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
The news sparked several historic comparisons on social media, with some sharing photos of Woodstock music fest.
""The last time jobless claims fell this low was the same year we landed folks on the moon,""..."
"A federal judge in Texas on Thursday struck down the Biden administration’s student-debt forgiveness plan, imperiling a key administration priority that would have canceled up to $20,000 in student loans for tens of millions of borrowers.
The Biden administration’s plan is an “unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative power” that also failed to go through normal regulatory processes, Judge Mark Pittman of the Northern District of Texas wrote in a 26-page opinion.
“No one can plausibly deny that it is either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the..."
"The White House on Monday said businesses should move forward with President Joe Biden’s vaccine and testing requirements for private businesses, despite a federal appeals court ordering a temporary halt to the rules.
“People should not wait,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during a briefing. “They should continue to move forward and make sure they’re getting their workplace vaccinated.”
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, considered one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, halted the requirements Saturday pending review, writing..."
"Hurricane Ian’s death toll continues to rise, surpassing 100 in Florida as of Tuesday after the hardest-hit Lee County reported even more fatalities, according to county-level death tolls, as search and rescue efforts remain ongoing for one of the deadliest storms in recent history in Florida.
More than half of the deaths have occurred in Lee County, where at least 54 people have been killed, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said at a news conference Monday.
Lee County includes the communities of Fort Myers and Sanibel, which took near-direct hits from Ian as the Category..."
"President Trump acknowledged Tuesday that an agreement on a coronavirus relief stimulus package would not materialize until after Election Day, but predicted that a deal would be reached.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump insisted his administration would still be willing to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) following the election on Nov. 3.
At the same time, Trump targeted Pelosi, claiming the top Democrat was seeking “bailouts” for states and cities run by Democrats and predicting boldly that the failed negotiations would cost Democrats the House..."
"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s office cleared the way on Sunday for an independent attorney with subpoena powers to investigate allegations against him of sexual misconduct.
The governor’s office backtracked on its original plan to choose its own investigator after widespread criticism from fellow Democrats.
“We will hire a law firm, deputize them as attorneys of our office, and oversee a rigorous and independent investigation,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
Cuomo, one of the nation’s most well-known Democratic politicians whose popularity soared during the early..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden took a strong stance this week against protest-related violence in cities from Portland, Oregon, to Kenosha, Wisconsin – where he paid a visit Thursday, two days after President Donald Trump came to survey the damage and express his support for law enforcement.
Mr. Biden met with the family of Jacob Blake, who was shot in the back by a white police officer on August 23, sparking a spate of arson and destruction. He also spoke to members of the community, on issues ranging from racism..."
"Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago—in a fresh sign that the labor-market rebound is gathering force.
Worker filings for jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell 92,000 last week from 590,000 the prior week. That brings the four-week average of initial claims, which smooths out volatility in weekly data, to the lowest point since the pandemic took hold, though still well above pre-pandemic levels.
“Overall it looks like we’re seeing healing in the jobs market,” said..."
"Missouri's governor issued a local state of emergency and imposed a nighttime curfew Saturday after violent protesters looted local businesses earlier in the day.
In a tense meeting at the Greater St. Mark Family Church in St. Louis, Gov. Jay Nixon said the overwhelming number of protesters have been peaceful. But the governor said he would not allow a small number of violent rioters to emerge again in the wake of a police-involved fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown one week ago.
""If we are going to have justice, we..."
"States across the country are grappling with how to hold their presidential nominating contests while keeping voters and poll workers shielded from the coronavirus.
Georgia on Saturday postponed its March 24 primary until May 19 and paused in-person early voting, which had already begun.
Louisiana said Friday it was postponing its April 4 primary, pushing it into June, and later-voting states such as Maryland and Pennsylvania are trying to figure out how to safely hold primaries as events across the U.S. are being rapidly canceled to limit the virus’s spread...."
"Families and a rallying community were mourning Wednesday after a gunman killed 21 people — including 19 children — at a Uvalde elementary school.
Officials have not publicly identified all those killed in the attack at Robb Elementary School, although by late Tuesday, families of the slain gathered at a local civic center and the victims’ names began to emerge on social media.
Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference one of the adults killed was a teacher; an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN that all were in..."
"The February market rout deepened Thursday, as major stock indexes around the globe posted another round of significant declines and uncertainty over the impact of the coronavirus began shading into fear.
The Dow industrials tumbled 1,190.95 points, or 4.4%, to 25766.64, bringing its slide this week to more than 3,200 points. The S&P declined 4.4%, extending its six-day decline to more than 10%—the fastest slide of that magnitude off a recent all-time high on record.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite notched their largest one-day percentage declines since August..."
"It doesn’t pay to fight the tape, but the stock market could be poised for a big-time rally once the current selloff subsides, a veteran chart-watcher said Thursday.
“This move lower is starting to feel a bit ridiculous, but we try not to argue with Ms. Market,” said Mark Arbeter, president of Arbeter Investments, in a note. “If and when this thing turns, we should see some rip-roaring rally.”
A relentless six-day selloff pushed major indexes into market-correction territory on Thursday, defined as a drop of more than 10% from..."
"Thousands of federal prison inmates could seek early release under details of a new, long-awaited clemency program unveiled by the Obama administration Wednesday.
The effort is part of a broader push by the administration and some in Congress to roll back the most punitive sentencing practices that were largely developed in the 1980s as a reaction to the crack-cocaine epidemic and a rise in crime.
Now, there are growing calls from conservatives and liberals to reduce prison sentences for nonviolent offenders, based on arguments that long sentences for nonviolent offenders..."
"Rex Tillerson, chosen today by President-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of State, is just what our country needs. I have personally seen Tillerson in action for nearly 30 years. As the chief executive of ExxonMobil, he is a strong leader with a track record of being tough in deals with Russia and getting results. This is what our country needs now more than ever."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the Obama administration’s new guidelines for isolating those exposed to Ebola “incredibly confusing,” and defended the state’s stricter policy requiring quarantines for health-care workers exposed to the virus.
“We aren’t moving an inch,” Mr. Christie said during an interview on the “Today” show Tuesday morning. “Our policy hasn’t changed and it will not change.”
The Republican governor faulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for being too slow in implementing a protocol for those returning to the U.S. from Ebola-impacted nations."
"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is stepping down as chief of the social media company, effective immediately. Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief technology officer, will take over the helm, the company said Monday.
Shares of Twitter were down about half a percent before noon on Monday.
Dorsey, 45, was serving as both the CEO of Twitter and Square, his digital payments company. Dorsey will remain a member of the board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders, the company said. Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor will become the chairman of the board, succeeding Patrick..."
"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans are generally positive in their evaluations of how each of nine leaders and institutions has handled the response to the coronavirus situation. Eight of the nine receive majority positive ratings -- led by U.S. hospitals, at 88% approval. Only the news media gets a more negative than positive review.
These data are from a March 13-22 Gallup poll, with the field period starting on the same day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, and spanning sharp increases in the number of..."
"Top military officials told lawmakers on Tuesday that they had recommended 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, contradicting comments made by President Biden earlier this year.
Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each acknowledged during public congressional testimony that they agreed with the recommendation of Army Gen. Austin Miller that 2,500 troops be left in the country, though they denied to detail what they advised Biden directly.
Biden announced his decision to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan back..."
"As Edward Snowden entered his second week of limbo in Moscow's airport on Sunday, his decision to go to Russia is looking riskier than it first appeared, and may have left him in a worse situation than if he had stayed in Hong Kong.
Even with his next move uncertain, the former National Security Agency contractor caused fresh uproar over the weekend. On Sunday, German weekly Der Spiegel, citing information from Mr. Snowden, reported that the U.S. had placed listening devices in a European Union office in Washington, infiltrated its..."
"President Trump has denied accusations that he made disparaging remarks about US soldiers who were captured or killed in battle.
According to The Atlantic magazine, Mr Trump cancelled a visit to a US cemetery outside Paris in 2018 because he said it was ""filled with losers"".
The allegations have since been corroborated by two senior military officials in a story by AP news agency.
But in a tweet, the president denounced the claims as ""made up fake news"".
During a visit to France in 2018, Mr Trump cancelled a visit..."
"Senate Republicans on Monday evening blocked a measure to fund the government and suspend the debt ceiling, carrying through on their threat to not deliver votes for a Democratic measure to raise the government's borrowing limit.
The vote was being held open at 48-50 more than an hour after it began. Sixty votes were needed to advance the measure.
No Republicans voted for the legislation."
"U.S. intelligence indicates that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un recently had cardiovascular surgery, NBC News reported Tuesday, citing American officials.
The intelligence also suggests that Kim could be incapacitated, NBC added, citing some of those officials.
The update came after the South Korean currency, the won, took a hit following an unconfirmed report that Kim was seriously ill. Kim has been out of public view for several days, according to officials cited by NBC."
"President Joe Biden’s condition since contracting COVID-19 has improved considerably and his greatest symptom now is a sore throat, his physician said on Sunday.
Biden’s cough and body aches have diminished since he tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday and he is not experiencing any shortness of breath, the physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a memo released by the White House.
“His symptoms continue to improve significantly. His predominant symptom now is sore throat. This is most likely a result of lymphoid activation as his body clears the virus, and is thus encouraging,” O’Connor..."
"U.S. former President Donald Trump said on Saturday if he were to run for president and win in 2024, he would pardon people charged with criminal offenses in connection with the deadly Jan. 6 assault by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump, who has not said whether he will run for president again after his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election, was speaking at a rally in Conroe, Texas.
""Another thing we'll do, and so many people have been asking me about it, if I run..."
"President Joe Biden said Tuesday that Russia has begun “an invasion” of Ukraine, and he announced sweeping sanctions on the major Russian bank VEB and its military bank.
The sanctions will prohibit American financial institutions from processing transactions for VEB and its military bank. This would effectively cut the banks out of transactions involving U.S. dollars, the global reserve currency. "
"After a week of both peaceful protests and violent chaos in the wake of George Floyd’s death, President Donald Trump announced, “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.”
Is Trump’s warning just bluster? Does the president have the authority to send the military into American cities?
The answer to this question involves a web of legal provisions that help define..."
"Republican Party leaders and their allies in the business community notched wins Tuesday in a series of competitive primaries in North Carolina and Ohio, an early sign they are gaining the upper hand over conservative activists ahead of other key 2014 primaries.
In North Carolina, Republican primary voters picked House Speaker Thom Tillis as their nominee to square off against Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in November, thanks in part to millions of dollars in last-minute a"
"The first event that will help decide the candidates for US president is to take place with Monday's Iowa caucuses.
Democratic and Republican voters will choose their preferred nominees for the White House race.
While victory in Iowa doesn't guarantee anyone the nomination, it can help give them crucial momentum.
The path appears clear for Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee, but there are still 11 people running for the Democratic nomination.
Many have spent the past few weeks vigorously campaigning in the Midwest state, which is always the..."
"The three white men accused of violating Ahmaud Arbery's civil rights and targeting him because he was Black were convicted of a federal hate crime on Tuesday in Brunswick, Georgia, the Associated Press reported.
Father and son Greg and Travis McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan had been charged with attempted kidnapping and interference with rights, which is a hate crime, CNN reported. Prosecutors had alleged that they targeted Arbery because of his race.
The defendants were found guilty on all counts, and the McMichaels were also convicted of an additional..."
"Unknown risks occur when no one expects them, in forms that no one could anticipate, and for which no one is prepared. Situations become crises under the influence of unknown risks, which in turn fosters panic rather than rational responses.   
The omicron variant is establishing itself to be the next unknown risk in the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Evidence of this are uniformly aggressive and unfettered reactions. These include travel bans from southern Africa that have become ubiquitous. Israel and Japan have closed their borders to foreign nationals and visitors.   
Yet, we are still learning much about this variant, including how..."
"The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol voted 9-0 Tuesday to recommend holding Stephen Bannon, a onetime adviser to former President Donald Trump, in criminal contempt for defying a congressional subpoena.
The committee’s vote is likely to kick off a legal battle that tests the extent of executive privileges claimed by a former president and whether those protections apply to conversations or advice from private citizens, not just government officials.
“Mr. Bannon will comply with our investigation or he will face the consequences,” said the committee’s chairman,..."
"Russia could be about to buy ""literally millions"" of artillery shells and rockets from old Cold-War ally North Korea, the White House said on Tuesday, calling this further evidence of Moscow's ""desperation"" amid supply shortages for its war in Ukraine.
Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, earlier dismissed reports from U.S. officials, which first appeared in the New York Times, citing newly declassified U.S. intelligence that Russia was making such purchases.
""I haven't heard it and I think that's another fake being circulated around,"" he told reporters.

"WASHINGTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department under a court order gave a federal judge on Thursday a redacted copy under seal of an affidavit outlining evidence that underpinned the FBI's Aug. 8 search of former President Donald Trump's Florida home for classified records he took with him after leaving office.
Anthony Coley, a Justice Department spokesperson, confirmed that the document was submitted as Florida-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart had ordered, declining further comment on the matter. Reinhart this month approved the Justice Department's warrant that preceded..."
"A portion of a condo tower in the Miami-area beachfront town of Surfside, Fla., collapsed. Rescue authorities responded to a call at about 1:30 a.m. Thursday and found the northeast section of the 12-story, 136-unit Champlain Towers South building had collapsed, said Ray Jadallah, chief of operations at Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.
Officials said it was too soon to determine the cause of the collapse. “Buildings just don’t fall down in America, they just don’t,” said Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett in an interview.
The scene was otherworldly, with couches, bunk beds and mangled..."
"Physicians must provide abortions in medical emergencies under federal law and will face penalties if they decline to offer the procedure in these cases, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra wrote in a letter to health-care providers on Monday.
Becerra said federal law pre-empts state abortion bans in cases where women face medical emergencies associated with pregnancy under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. If an abortion is necessary to treat a woman facing a medical emergency, physicians must offer the procedure, the health secretary wrote.

"Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared Thursday there was no guarantee of a final deal over Tehran’s nuclear program, saying world powers led by the U.S. couldn’t be trusted to negotiate in good faith.
“There has been nothing done and there is nothing binding,” Mr. Khamenei said in his eagerly awaited response to the framework nuclear agreement struck in Switzerland last week between Iran and world powers led by the U.S. “I neither agree nor disagree.”
Mr. Khamenei, who has the final say on most matters of state in..."
"The Trump campaign legal team is throwing everything at the wall in battleground states — a last-ditch effort to use the courts to freeze time in states where President Trump was ahead (but keep counting in key places where he appeared behind).
Why it matters: None of the legal actions was poised to change the outcome, but the effort could delegitimize the 2020 election in the eyes of millions of Trump supporters even if the final math based on legitimate counts show Joe Biden the winner.
The big picture: The..."
"Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, and three crewmates soared high above the Texas desert aboard his space venture Blue Origin's New Shepard launch vehicle on Tuesday and returned to Earth, a historic suborbital flight that helps to inaugurate a new era of private commercial space tourism.
The spacecraft ignited its BE-3 engines for a liftoff from Blue Origin's Launch Site One facility about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural town of Van Horn. There were generally clear skies with a few patchy clouds on a cool morning for the launch...."
"Senate Republicans on Tuesday rejected an opening effort by Democrats to compel the Trump administration to hand over documents related to the delayed Ukraine aid.
Democrats offered two amendments to the rules resolution that would have required the administration to turn over documents. Both were tabled, effectively blocking the requests, in back-to-back 53-47 votes.
The documents, according to Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.), would relate to conversations and documents between President Trump, top administration officials and Ukraine on the delayed funding, which was eventually released in September.
""No..."
"The Biden administration is moving forward on a plan to mandate the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes, a policy that would upend the $95 billion U.S. cigarette industry and, health officials say, prompt millions of people to quit smoking.
The plan, unveiled Tuesday as part of the administration’s agenda of regulatory actions, likely wouldn’t take effect for several years. The Food and Drug Administration plans to publish a proposed rule in May 2023. Then it would invite public comments before publishing a final rule. Tobacco companies could then sue,..."
"The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday that human genes isolated from the body can't be patented, a victory for doctors and patients who argued that such patents interfere with scientific research and the practice of medicine.
The court was handing down one of its most significant rulings in the age of molecular medicine, deciding who may own the fundamental building blocks of life.
The case involved Myriad Genetics Inc., which holds patents related to two genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, that can indicate whether a woman has a heightened..."
"Students have slammed a Texas school board's ""book review"" order that would allow board members to ban books from district schools without public comment. At least one of the students pointed out that the Granbury Independent School District's (GISD) plan would most hurt ""honor students"" looking to advance their studies with advanced texts.
The students commented against the policy at a Tuesday meeting of the school board in Granbury, Texas, a town of roughly 11,000 people just southwest of Fort Worth.
""I simply want to emphasize who it is that..."
"The Biden administration will soon slowly begin allowing asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexican border towns under former President Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy to enter the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.
Why it matters: President Biden has promised to end the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols program, as it is formally called, which forced tens of thousands of migrants into dangerous, squalid conditions in Mexico as they awaited court proceedings. DHS estimates that there are about 25,000 migrants in the MPP program who have active..."

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted in three corruption cases, marking the first time a sitting head of state in Israel will face criminal charges.
Netanyahu was charged Thursday with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The indictment follows a four-day hearing last month with the prime minister’s defense team.
The first case, which is considered to be the most serious, accuses Netanyahu of bribery for allegedly engaging in a quid pro quo deal with businessman and media mogul Shaul Elovich in which Netnayahu, during his tenure as..."
"Americans may have fallen short of President Biden's July 4 vaccination goal, but by most measures, we should be thankful for how far we've come in the past year.
The big picture: Last July 4, many Americans were hunkering down in their backyards with small cookouts, and travel was way down. This year, most adults have at least some vaccine protection, travel is back up, and most Americans are ready to move on with their lives.
By the numbers: As of Saturday, 67% of U.S. adults have gotten at least one vaccine dose, according to the Centers..."
"Top White House health officials indicated Tuesday that the public is likely to need annual COVID-19 booster shots, making this year’s updated booster similar to an annual flu shot.
“It is becoming increasingly clear that, looking forward with the COVID-19 pandemic, in the absence of a dramatically different variant, we likely are moving towards a path of vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual updated COVID-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population,” Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious diseases doctor, said..."
"House Democrats will consider as much as $2.9 trillion in tax hikes for the next 10 years — mostly on the extremely wealthy and corporate America — as they scramble for ways to pay for President Biden's $3.5 trillion infrastructure and social spending plan.
Why it matters: A draft proposal from the Ways and Means Committee, which ricocheted across Washington Sunday night, previews epic fall fights between Democrats and some of the best-armed lobbies in America.
Driving the news: The summary, first reported by The Washington Post, includes a top personal rate of 39.6%,..."
"The federal government should consider requiring Covid-19 vaccines for domestic flights, the nation’s top infectious disease expert said Monday.
“When you make vaccinations a requirement, that’s another incentive to get more people vaccinated,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that’s something that seriously should be considered.”
There is no indication at this point that a vaccine mandate is on its way for U.S. flights. When asked on MSNBC, Fauci, White House chief medical advisor, declined to..."
"A raucous and chaotic clash between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden gave Americans their first chance to weigh their choices side by side in a White House contest that has until now remained remarkably stable.
The coronavirus pandemic allowed both candidates to avoid an awkward, and probably unwelcome, handshake that would have happened moments before the shouting started.
“This was the most chaotic and attack-filled presidential debate in our history,” Mitchell McKinney, director of the Political Communication institute at the University of Missouri, said shortly after its..."
"President Biden will sign an executive order on Monday establishing the Gender Policy Council within the White House to focus on uplifting the rights of women and address gender-based discrimination and violence.
He will also sign an executive order directing the Department of Education to review the Title IX regulation issued by the Trump administration to determine whether it is consistent with the policy of the Biden administration that students be “guaranteed education free from sexual violence,” administration officials said.
The orders come on International Women's Day and he will..."
"Prince Andrew is to face a civil case in the US over allegations he sexually assaulted a woman when she was 17.
Virginia Giuffre is suing the prince, claiming he abused her in 2001.
His lawyers said the case should be thrown out, citing a 2009 deal she signed with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But a New York judge ruled that the case could be heard.
The prince has consistently denied the claims. Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on an ongoing legal matter.
The motion to dismiss..."

The banks froze millions of dollars worth of deposits in April, telling customers they were upgrading their internal systems. read more The banks have not issued any communication on the matter since, depositors said.
None of the banks has responded to emails and telephone calls seeking comment. Chinese media has reported that the frozen deposits could be worth up to $1.5..."
"The Trump administration has named three cities that are slated to lose federal funding after the White House accused them of tolerating crime.
New York City, Portland and Seattle are on the list of ""anarchist cities"" that Trump officials say have failed to stem crime linked to a summer of protests.
It follows a memo from Mr Trump earlier this month, threatening the move.
The mayors of the cities have promised to sue, calling Mr Trump's move a political stunt.

"Ahead of the debate, which was the first of two featuring 20 Democratic White House hopefuls, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was the most searched candidate of the 10 hopefuls who would appear on stage on Wednesday, while Gabbard was the fourth-most searched. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) were second and third, respectively.
During the debate, Gabbard moved into the top most-searched spot, followed by Booker."
"The U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows there have been over 15,000 cases almost every day since the end of March. On Tuesday, over 34,000 new cases were recorded.
It has now been suggested the uptick in COVID-19 cases may, in part, be due to politicization of the pandemic, with a failure to coordinate a unified response across the country."
"Hurricane Ian moved near the Cayman Islands and closer to western Cuba early Monday on a track to hit Florida as a major hurricane this week.
Ian was forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major hurricane as soon as late Monday before becoming an even stronger Category 4 hurricane over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before striking the west central coast of Florida on Wednesday.
Authorities in Cuba suspended classes in Pinar del Rio province and planned evacuations Monday as Ian gained strength on approach to Grand Cayman and..."
"Attorney General William Barr on Thursday offered a spirited defense of President Donald Trump ahead of the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election, emphasizing that it found no collusion between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.
Barr, the top U.S. law enforcement official and a Trump appointee, gave a news conference at the Justice Department as he sought to shape the narrative on a watershed day in Trump’s tumultuous presidency.
“President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office and sought..."
"In the presidential election of 2020, the United States was the target of a legal coup for the first time in its history. Legal coups don’t rely on tanks rolling through the streets, and their damage to democracy is not—for the most part—measured in a body count. Legal coups don’t even cancel elections. They manipulate them.
The insidious danger of legal coups is that they come clothed in arcane procedures instead of military fatigues. Their foot soldiers are lawyers, not storm troopers. How many people would watch the House Select..."
"A magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked southern California Friday night, sending tremors that could be felt in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and nearly 400 miles north in Sacramento. The quake caused fires, power outages and collapsed buildings, officials said.
The powerful quake struck around 8:20 p.m. local time and was centered near Ridgecrest, Calif., a community of 29,000 people on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada where a 6.4 temblor had hit Thursday morning.

Two local news stations, KMOV and KSDK, reported that the warrant was carried out Friday night at Mark and Patricia McCloskey's home in St. Louis's affluent Central West End neighborhood.
KSDK reported that the search resulted in police seizing the rifle that Mark McCloskey was seen holding during the incident."
"Job creation for August was a huge disappointment, with the economy adding just 235,000 positions, the Labor Department reported Friday.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 720,000 new hires.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.2% from 5.4%, in line with estimates.
August’s total — the worst since January — comes with heightened fears of the pandemic and the impact that rising Covid cases could have on what has been a mostly robust recovery. The weak report could cloud policy for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing whether..."
"President Biden on Thursday said that he'll ask for a review of whether marijuana should remain classified as a Schedule 1 substance under federal law.
Why it matters: This could be momentous for the upstart U.S. cannabis industry, which has been slowed at every turn by federal prohibitions.
What to know: Most cannabis companies are unable to use federally chartered banks, largely owing to the Schedule 1 designation, and instead are relegated to using state-chartered banks and credit unions.
Not only does this limit borrowing opportunities, but it also negatively..."
"The Democratic White House hopefuls slugged it out on Tuesday at the party's 10th presidential debate, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) coming under a fierce volley of attacks ahead of Saturday’s primary in South Carolina.
Here are five takeaways from a heated night in Charleston, S.C.
Rivals desperate to stop Sanders
Sanders occupied the center spot on stage, and it was clear from the onset that the front-runner would be the focus of attacks from rivals who feel they have only a few days to stop him.
The senator is..."
"The heads of the two largest immigration enforcement agencies are expected on Monday to order its officials to stop using terms generally regarded as offensive by immigrants, like ""illegal alien"" and ""assimilation.""

The memos were first reported by The Washington Post."
"Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is suing Facebook, Twitter and Google, as well as their respective CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai.
Trump, who has a history of threatening legal action but not always following through, made the announcement at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, at 11 a.m. ET alongside two leaders from America First Policy Institute, the pro-Trump nonprofit group that is supporting the lawsuits.
The three related lawsuits, filed in federal court in Florida, allege the tech giants have violated plaintiffs’ First Amendments rights.
The lawsuits were unveiled just..."
"Scientists from the MIT and Stanford have published a proposal to retrofit California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, which is currently scheduled to be decommissioned and closed in August 2025.
The plan would save up to $21 billion in power grid costs if Diablo Canyon were kept open until 2050.
In addition, keeping the plant open to 2050 would preserve 90,000 acres of land that would otherwise need to go to be covered in photovoltaic solar panels to meet California’s climate goals. The scientists also propose that Diablo Canyon could..."
"The House on Tuesday approved a bill to extend the federal government's borrowing authority with no strings attached, after Republican leaders dropped all policy demands to avoid a market-rattling confrontation in an election year.
The measure, which would suspend the debt limit and allow the government to borrow until March 16, 2015, marked a retreat from efforts by House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) to require any debt-ce"

"Queues have sprung up along Russia's border as men attempt to leave the country amid a military call-up for the war in Ukraine.
President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation on Wednesday, which could see 300,000 people summoned to serve in the war.
The Kremlin says reports of fighting-age men fleeing are exaggerated.
But on the border with Georgia, miles-long queues of vehicles have formed including men trying to escape the war.
One man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie he had grabbed..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on Wednesday that he's barely spoken to President Biden since the Jan. 20 inauguration, accusing the White House of shifting to the ""hard left.""
""I don't believe I've spoken with him since he was sworn in,"" McConnell said during an interview with Fox News, adding that he hadn't been invited to the White House either.
Spokespeople for McConnell didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but clarified to CNN that while they had spoken since the Jan. 20 inauguration, they haven't talked..."
"President Biden’s sagging approval ratings, especially among independents, are raising questions about his ability to move his agenda through a House and Senate where centrist and liberal Democrats are battling one another.
Democrats aren’t running away from the president, but the approval rating hit could make it tougher for Biden to muscle moderates such as Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) who are balking at the $3.5 trillion cost of his budget reconciliation measure.
Some Democrats note that Biden’s approval rating at this point in his presidency is still significantly higher than..."
"As the Black Lives Matter movement captures national attention, websites and social media posts are spreading a false claim about donations made to a leading Black Lives Matter organization.
An Instagram page for the website WokeHub.com claimed, for example, that “donations made to Black Lives Matter website go directly to the DNC” and that BlackLivesMatter.com “appears to be an international money laundering program used by the Democratic National Committee.” A similar claim appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.com.
Conservative personality Candace Owens also put the claim before her more..."
"Lawmakers in Britain and the European Union have finally found common ground for a post-Brexit trade deal. While that clears a major hurdle, the proposed deal still has a long way to go before it’s fully approved by all parties.
With only days to go before Britain leaves the E.U., politicians on both sides will have to rush the bill through their various institutional hoops. The late agreement technically can’t be ratified by the European parliament before the Dec. 31 deadline, which is when the transition period ends. Provisional approval..."
"Senate Republicans on Friday blocked legislation to form a commission to probe the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
Senators voted 54-35 on the House-passed bill, falling short of the 10 GOP votes needed to get it over an initial hurdle. GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah), Susan Collins (Maine), Bill Cassidy (La.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) broke ranks, voting to advance the legislation.
Senate Republicans were widely expected to reject the legislation after days of publicly and privately warning that they believed the commission would damage them heading into the 2022 midterm election, keeping former President Trump and the attack,..."
"Some tariffs to be delayed until Dec. 15 on items including cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, footwear
The Trump administration will delay tariffs on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and some other items until Dec. 15, softening the blow of levies that were scheduled to take effect on Sept. 1 against roughly $300 billion of imports from China.
The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that some products will be removed from the tariff lists entirely, based on health, safety, national security and other factors. The statement didn’t..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking at data that suggests ""3 feet are okay under certain circumstances,"" for social distancing guidelines, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday.
Why it matters: One of the biggest hurdles for school administrators and a barrier to reopening is making sure students stay the recommended 6 feet apart. Fauci said ""it won't be very long"" for the CDC to potentially adjust official guidelines on social distancing policies, if the data suggests 3 feet of distance won't..."
"The Supreme Court, for the second time in two days, rejected a GOP request to shorten the deadline mail-in ballots must be received by North Carolina officials to be counted.
The state of play: The state's deadline had been extended from 3 days to 9 days post-Election Day.
The big picture: These are the latest in a series of decisions over ballot deadlines in states across the U.S. amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The rulings come shortly after the court rejected an effort by Wisconsin Democrats and civil rights groups to..."
"Republican Dan Bishop won a special U.S. congressional election in North Carolina on Tuesday, turning back a vigorous Democratic challenge to save a longtime stronghold for President Donald Trump’s party.
With 99% of precincts reporting, Bishop, a 55-year-old state senator for whom Trump campaigned, led Democrat Dan McCready, a 36-year-old veteran of the Marines, 50.81% to 48.59%, the state board of elections said.

"California officials on Friday threw their weight behind legislation that would let private citizens sue firearm manufacturers and distributors if they violate the state’s assault weapons ban or other gun control measures—the first state effort to mimic the structure of Texas’ near-total ban on abortions for a different political issue.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) announced Assembly Bill 1594 (AB 1594) Friday and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) spoke out in support of it at a press conference, promoting the legislation after the governor first suggested it in December and..."
"The Department of Justice on Friday released a redacted version of the affidavit related to the search warrant for former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.
Why it matters: The released affidavit sheds light on new details of the criminal investigation, including the probable cause that warranted the search.
State of play: The previously unsealed search warrant and inventory revealed the FBI removed around 20 boxes, including 11 sets of classified information from the Trump property, including some marked as ""top secret."""
"The U.S. added nearly 84,000 coronavirus cases for the second-straight day, with new infections coming in barely below the daily record set the previous day.
Saturday’s total of 83,718 new cases marks the second-highest single-day count after the record 83,757 infections logged Friday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has reported nearly 8.58 million infections in total, with the death toll nearing 225,000."
"Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, facing a second day of interrogation from Republican lawmakers highly critical of the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Driving the news: The committee's chair, the hawkish New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, pulled no punches in his opening statement, threatening to subpoena Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other Biden officials who decline to voluntarily appear before the committee.
""Mr. Secretary, the execution of the U.S. withdrawal was clearly and fatally flawed,"" Menendez told Blinken.
Menendez promised accountability for the..."
"Democrats kept control of the Senate on Saturday after Catherine Cortez Masto won re-election in Nevada, repelling Republican efforts to retake the chamber.
The Associated Press called Nevada for Cortez Masto on Saturday, projecting that Republican opponent Adam Laxalt—backed by former president Donald Trump—could not make enough gains to win in one of the most competitive races of the midterm elections.
Masto's victory allows Democrats to retain control of the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris' tiebreaking vote, making it harder for Republicans to thwart President Joe Biden's agenda even if Republicans gain..."
"NIAID director Anthony Fauci said Sunday he is ""confident as you can be"" that most states will reach a peak in Omicron coronavirus cases by mid-February.
Why it matters: Asked about the prospect on ABC's ""This Week,"" Fauci said that while you ""never want to be overconfident,"" the pattern of how Omicron cases peak in other countries suggests that the U.S. is headed in ""the same direction.""
The NIAID director's comments come as the variant is still wreaking havoc in parts of the country. However, several experts have echoed Fauci's optimism regarding an..."
"An emergency jobless-benefits program due to expire this weekend would pinch the finances of more than a million Americans, setting the stage for the what could become lawmakers' first flashpoint of the midterm election year.
While the program's end would barely dent the broader economy, the money at stake is meaningful. The federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation, launched during the middle of the recession, pays on average $300 a week to 1.3 million long-term jobless who have exhausted the roughly 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits most states provide. If extended,..."
"Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday he had interfered in U.S. elections and would continue doing so in future, the first such admission from a figure implicated by Washington in efforts to influence American politics.
In comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russia's Facebook equivalent VKontakte, Prigozhin said: ""We have interfered (in U.S. elections), we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do.""

"Democratic-led Intelligence Committee approves report alleging president engaged in misconduct, obstruction for personal gain.
A Democratic-controlled House committee approved a report accusing President Trump of soliciting foreign election interference and placing “his own personal and political interests above the national interests” by pushing Ukraine to announce an investigation into a 2020 political rival.
Mr. Trump and other officials pressured Kyiv to announce probes into Democrat Joe Biden and into a theory that Ukraine’s government interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of..."
"Number of experimental vaccines under development also buoys sentiment in markets.
U.S. stocks rose Tuesday on optimism about economies reopening and the potential development of a coronavirus vaccine.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 640 points, or 2.6%, to 25112. The S&P 500 rose 2%, climbing back above 3000 for the first time since early March and above its 200-day moving average, a closely watched barometer of its strength. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%.

"The Supreme Court upheld a pair of Arizona voting rules against Democratic claims that the state discriminated against minority voters, a decision that could make it more difficult to challenge new state efforts to tighten election regulations.
The court, in a 6-3 opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled Arizona was on solid legal ground in enforcing rules that prohibit third parties from collecting mail-in ballots and disallow votes cast in the wrong precinct.
The decision, issued on the final day before the court’s summer recess, was one of two major rulings that divided..."
"Madeleine K. Albright, who passed away on Wednesday, shaped a generation of foreign policy leaders — gently and usually with a smile. She knew every senior official, mentored many of them, and managed to say a cheery word even to people who took “dour” as a compliment.
Even into her 80s, Albright had the style of a college undergraduate, gossiping late into the night with her countless friends in the United States and abroad. At the opening dinner of each summer’s gathering of the Aspen Strategy Group, she would don a..."
"Approximately 199,000 Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance‌ last‌ week, a 71,000 decrease from the week before.
Why it matters: The Labor Department said Wednesday it was the lowest level of initial claims since Nov. 15, 1969, when claims reached 197,000.
This same time last year, unemployment claims were around 700,000, per the Labor Department.
Our thought bubble, via Axios' Felix Salmon: Employers are so desperate for employees that layoffs are all but nonexistent. While America still has very little in the way of long-term job security, it currently offers unprecedented levels of..."
"The US Congress has passed a bill that requires companies to prove that goods imported from China's Xinjiang region were not produced with forced labour.
The US has accused China of genocide in its repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority there - a charge that China has repeatedly rejected.
The bill had been criticised by major companies that do business in the area, including Coca-Cola, Nike and Apple.
Its passage also overcame initial lack of support from the White House.
It was approved by the Senate on Thursday with..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he will posthumously pardon American social reformer and women’s rights activist Susan B. Anthony who was fined in 1872 for voting illegally.
Speaking at a White House event to mark the 100th anniversary of ratification of the U.S. Constitution’s 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote, Trump said: “I will be signing a full and complete pardon of Susan B. Anthony. She was never pardoned.”
Trump is facing a tough fight for re-election in November and has tried in recent weeks..."
"Florida Monday became the first state in the U.S. to broadly regulate social media platforms' moderation of user speech online.
Driving the news: Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law fining social media services that permanently ban candidates running for office in Florida.
The law also prevents platforms from removing content from news outlets above a certain size.
It allows people to sue platforms if they think social media companies are inconsistently applying their content rules.
Yes, but: Legal experts expect the law to face constitutional challenges.

"A group of House Democrats on Tuesday announced they would move to codify federal protections for transgender people.
The proposal, dubbed the “Transgender Bill of Rights,” would codify the Supreme Court’s 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision that protects employees against discrimination for being gay or transgender.
The proposal would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to explicitly include protections for gender identity and sex characteristics, expand access to gender-affirming care and ban conversion therapy.
It would also require the attorney general to designate a liaison dedicated to overseeing..."
"U.S. anti-missile defences intercepted as many as five rockets fired at Kabul's airport early on Monday, a U.S. official said, as the United States rushed to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan to end its longest war.
Afghan media said the attack was launched from the back of a vehicle. The Pajhwok news agency said several rockets struck different parts of the Afghan capital.
Initial reports did not indicate any U.S. casualties, the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The attack followed a huge Islamic State suicide bombing outside the..."
"South African data offered a glimmer of hope on Wednesday about the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant, but World Health Organization officials cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions as the strain spread across the globe.
With the second Christmas of the pandemic days away, countries imposed new restrictions on their citizens while worrying about the damage the variant might inflict on their economies.
Plans for Christmas parties and celebrations were wiped out from London to New Delhi amid the uncertainty.

"Justice Department prosecutors believe there’s enough evidence to charge former President Donald Trump with obstruction in the agency’s investigation into documents he brought back to Mar-A-Lago, Bloomberg reports—but investigators are reportedly still conflicted on whether it’s wise to charge the ex-president, and any indictment is unlikely to come soon.
A group of DOJ prosecutors believe that Trump could be charged with obstruction based on the evidence, Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources familiar with the investigation, but they have not yet made any formal recommendation on whether he should be charged..."
"While defending President Trump's decision to authorize the drone strike that killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, Vice President Pence claimed on Twitter that Soleimani helped ""10 of the 12"" Sept. 11 attackers travel to Afghanistan.
Reality check: ""That does not match established historical accounts of General Suleimani or public United States intelligence about the hijackers,"" The New York Times writes."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill Friday that would create a ""Commission on President Capacity"" to allow Congress to intervene under the 25th Amendment, which can be invoked if the president becomes physically incapable of fulfilling their role.
Why it matters: There's almost no chance of this bill ever becoming law, so it's meant more as a publicity stunt to troll President Trump — despite her claims otherwise.
Pelosi argued on Bloomberg TV that Trump is in an ""altered state"" from his coronavirus treatment and that ""there may be..."
"John Durham, the special counsel looking into the government's investigation of Russian election interference, distanced himself from reports in conservative media that a motion he filed last week implied Hillary Clinton's campaign paid to spy on Trump White House servers, according to the New York Times.
What they're saying: In a filing Thursday, Durham disavowed responsibility for how the filing was interpreted: ""If third parties or members of the media have overstated, understated or otherwise misinterpreted facts contained in the government’s motion, that does not in any way undermine the valid reasons for the..."
"The FBI’s surprise search of former President Trump’s residence has raised unanswered questions and engendered wide speculation. Here is a guide for the perplexed.
What do we know about the law enforcement activity on Monday at Mar-a-Lago?
On Aug. 8, federal agents searched former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump, who was in New York at the time, released a statement calling the search an “unannounced raid” involving a “large group of FBI agents” and noting that the agents “broke into” his safe. Trump did not..."
"In an acknowledgment of the Republican Party’s new dominance in Congress, President Barack Obama and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell , soon to be leader of the Senate, tentatively began charting a path forward Wednesday on trade, taxes and other policy matters.
A phone conversation between the two men, who have had a distant and prickly relationship, underscored the new political landscape that Mr. Obama will face in his final two years in office: a Senate that has slipped from his party’s control and a Republican majority in the House on..."
"U.S. inflation closed out 2021 at its highest level since 1982 as robust consumer demand exacerbated pandemic-related supply shortages.
The Labor Department said the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—rose 7% in December from the same month a year ago, up from 6.8% in November. That was the fastest pace since 1982 and marked the third straight month in which inflation exceeded 6%.
The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 5.5% in December from a year earlier. That was..."
"Special counsel Robert Mueller said Wednesday that charging President Trump with a crime ""was not an option we could consider"" due to Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations.
Mueller said that his office interpreted current DOJ guidance that states a sitting president cannot be indicted as meaning his team could not bring a charge against Trump as they investigated him for obstruction of justice.
The special counsel said that the Constitution requires a ""process other than the criminal justice system"" for taking disciplinary action against a sitting president, but did not..."
"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Sunday warned of “riots in the streets” if former President Trump is prosecuted for his handling of classified materials found when the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago home. 
“If there’s a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle … there’ll be riots in the streets,” Graham told former South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy, who now hosts Fox News’s “Sunday Night in America.”
Trump shared a clip of the interview on Truth Social later Sunday evening.
Gowdy was chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi,..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden is putting the finishing touches on the rollout of his presidential campaign and is expected to announce as soon as next week that he is joining the sprawling field of 2020 Democratic contenders.
The 76-year-old former senator and two-time presidential candidate is expected to launch his campaign with a video as early as Wednesday, according to three people close to the former vice president.

"Retailers and manufacturers are overordering or placing orders too early amid panic over the massive supply chain crisis, and that’s making things much worse, those in the industry told CNBC.
“Suddenly, retailers and manufacturers are overordering because of these supply chain issues, and that’s just leading to essentially an even worse scenario,” Jonathan Savoir, CEO of supply chain technology firm Quincus told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Monday.
Supply chains everywhere have been hit by massive disruptions this year, from container shortages to floods and Covid infections setting off port closures.
That’s gotten worse because..."
"Before the Kansas City Chiefs began their Super Bowl defense Thursday night against the Houston Texans in the first game of the 2020 NFL season, there was a question for both teams: How would they protest against racism in America?
The answer was complicated. The Texans left the field entirely before both the national anthem and the playing of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song sometimes referred to as the Black national anthem. Their demonstration echoed a tense weekend in 2017, when several teams stayed in the locker room..."
"Xi Jinping's role in Ukraine is far less visible than Vladimir Putin's, but make no mistake: China is also a combatant in the war. What isn't yet clear is whether China will feel the consequences as Russia has.
On Friday, President Joe Biden announced that the United States, along with NATO members, European Union countries, and Group of Seven nations, will withdraw ""most favored nation"" trade privileges for Russia. Biden also announced bans on imports of Russian goods—seafood, vodka, and diamonds—and a prohibition on exports of luxury items.
These actions, at least on their face, run afoul of..."
"The Jan. 6 committee hearing on Thursday promised to prove former President Trump was responsible for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.
Driving the news: “President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame,” Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said, before laying out a seven-point plan for how the panel will publicly show Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election and prevent the transition of power to President-elect Biden.
The last hearing, likely to be the most explosive, will center on Trump's specific actions as the violence was underway.
Between the..."
"Nebraska and West Virginia held high-profile primaries that served as tests of former President Trump’s lingering sway among GOP voters. 
University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen won the GOP nod over businessman Charles Herbster, who ran with Trump’s endorsement, and state Sen. Brett Lindstrom, who cast himself as a more pragmatic Republican. In West Virginia, hard-liner Rep. Alex Mooney (R) defeated Rep. David McKinley (R) in an incumbent-on-incumbent primary sparked by redistricting. 
Here are five takeaways from the primary results. 
Trump suffered his first big loss this cycle…

"Oil prices skyrocketed on Thursday after President Donald Trump told CNBC Saudis and Russia will ease pressure on oil, ending a price war that has contributed to crude’s massive plunge.
West Texas Intermediate crude futures surged 24.4%, or $4.99 to trade at $25.30 per barrel. Earlier in the session WTI traded as high as $27.39. International benchmark Brent crude jumped 22%, or $5.46, to trade at $30.21 per barrel."
"Stocks pushed higher Thursday, buoyed after President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to curb oil production in order to stabilize prices, even after data showed U.S. weekly jobless claims soared to a record.

"The Trump administration and Democrats made progress on coronavirus stimulus talks Tuesday but still need to overcome major differences to reach a deal before the 2020 election, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said.
Meadows outlined the state of talks following a 45-minute conversation between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He told CNBC the sides have made “good progress” but “still have a ways to go” to strike an agreement. Pelosi and Mnuchin plan to speak again Wednesday.
“I would think that those discussions hopefully..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned the Trump administration against striking a stimulus deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over fears it would divide Republicans before Election Day.
McConnell told Republican colleagues about the warning during a private lunch on Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The sources spoke to the Associated Press anonymously due to the private nature of the meeting.
Republicans have expressed concerns that a stimulus deal before Election Day could divide the party. Many file-and-rank members of the GOP have already declined to..."
"As I have watched Confederate monuments being removed by state and local governments, and sometimes by the forceful will of the American people, the fact that 10 U.S. Army installations are named for Confederate officers has weighed on me. That number includes the Army’s largest base, one very special to many in uniform: Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. The highway sign for Bragg proclaims it home of the airborne and special operations forces. I had three assignments there during my career. Soldiers stationed at Bragg are rightly proud to serve..."
"The man accused of attacking U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for New York governor, at an upstate event Thursday is out of jail this morning. Meanwhile, the congressman says he’s doing OK after only suffering minor injuries.
Photos show what appears to be a two-bladed weapon clenched in the suspect’s fist as he approached Zeldin.
Zeldin’s campaign said the attacker was taken into custody and the congressman continued his speech.
“I’m OK,” Zeldin said in a statement. “Fortunately, I was able to grab his wrist and stop him for a few..."
"The Supreme Court said Tuesday it would decide whether for-profit employers can invoke their religious beliefs to deny contraceptive coverage to female employees who would otherwise be entitled to it under the Affordable Care Act, in a new case before the high court challenging part of President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul.
The 2010 federal law, most of which the high court upheld in June 2012, includes contraceptive coverage among the minimum package of benefits insurance policies must include. The Obama administration has exempted religiously affiliated nonprofit employers, such as Catholic..."

"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ultimatum to the West drastically increases the risk of a nuclear conflict, analysts and campaigners warned, with world leaders denouncing what they describe as “reckless” and “irresponsible” threats.
Speaking in a rare televised address Wednesday, Putin called up extra forces for the war in Ukraine and warned that if the territorial integrity of Russia was threatened, the Kremlin would “certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. It is not a bluff.”
It was widely interpreted as a threat that..."
"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday that Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearings will proceed as planned even though two Republicans on the Judiciary Committee had contracted the coronavirus. Senators Thom Tillis and Mike Lee, who sit on the panel that will preside over the hearings, tested positive for COVID-19 in the past day. Both were at the White House on Sept. 26 when President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month.

"A panel of experts drafted by the World Health Organization to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare a framework to investigate future outbreaks has published its first report.
The panel, set up in October, comprises 26 experts from around the world and is called the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO).
Its work follows a previous WHO-China report on COVID-19, and a U.S. intelligence inquiry, both of which pointed towards a natural origin for the pandemic, likely from bats, rather than a lab..."
"Social media giant Facebook has seen its daily active users (DAUs) drop for the first time in its 18-year history.
Facebook's parent company Meta Networks says DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter.
The firm also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rivals like TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers are also cutting spending.
Meta's shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York.
The slide in Meta's share price..."
"US Attorney General William Barr, a top ally of President Trump, has said the Justice Department has found no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election.
""To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,"" said the top US law enforcement agent.
His comments are seen as a big blow to Mr Trump, who has not accepted defeat.
He and his campaign have filed lawsuits in states that he lost, as they begin certifying Joe Biden as the winner...."
"President Biden and Senate Democrats have a special gift in mind for what would have been the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 93rd birthday: declaring hyperpartisanship an insurmountable reality and capitulating accordingly.
Specifically, in order to advance voting rights legislation, Democrats are on the brink of eliminating the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for moving legislation forward, to make it possible to pass bills with a simple majority of 51 votes. It strikes me as both ironic and cynical that this craven surrender to partisanship is attached to King, a..."
"President Trump on Wednesday discouraged Americans from purchasing Goodyear tires after it was reported that company employees in Kansas were told not to wear “Make America Great Again” attire or other politically-affiliated gear.
“Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, adding in parentheses, “This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!”"
"The bipartisan gun safety deal announced today falls well short of what President Biden has called for but still marks the first time in decades Republicans have shown a willingness to do anything resembling progress in this arena.
Why it matters: Narrowing the scope of negotiations to rule out restrictions on gun ownership was critical to securing the support of 10 Republicans — but there are still plenty of opportunities for the wheels to fall off."
"Republicans are zeroing in on the border as a midterm attack issue on Democrats, seeing a political opportunity in the Biden administration’s decision to revoke a key restriction known as Title 42.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a briefing with GOP members and officials from the Border Patrol’s labor union Monday to talk about the impact of lifting the policy.
“Have you watched some of the footage of what goes on just on the other side of the border? Looks like it comes from Ukraine,” McCarthy told reporters.

"The Treasury Department on Tuesday missed a second deadline from House Democrats to provide President Trump’s tax returns.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a letter that the department can't act on the request ""unless and until it is determined to be consistent with law.""

"The federal government will award an $11.6 billion aid package to Puerto Rico, focused on the territory’s energy and education systems, to help the island recover from the devastation brought by 2017’s Hurricane Maria, the White House said on Friday.
The Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) will provide $9.6 billion in funding for the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority to make replacements, repairs and improvements to equipment and buildings, the White House said.
An additional $2 billion grant for Puerto Rico’s Education Department will “focus on restoring school buildings and..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) signaled Thursday she wouldn’t support a stand-alone airline relief bill without a broader coronavirus aid package, the latest twist in late efforts to pass more economic relief before the election.
Mrs. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were expected to talk Thursday about potential aid for airlines, which have been pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic.
“There is not going to be any stand-alone bill unless there is a bigger bill and it can be part of that, or it could be in addition to..."
"IOWA CITY, Iowa—Former Vice President Joe Biden pushed back against suggestions he should testify before President Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate, saying the process “is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.”
Mr. Biden, in a series of tweets on Saturday, explained why he planned to refuse to comply with a subpoena if Republicans in the Senate seek his testimony during the upcoming impeachment trial. He said during his lengthy career in the Senate and as vice president that he had “always complied with a lawful order” and “cooperated with legitimate..."
"As the Democrats’ spending plan moves closer to a House vote, one of the more controversial provisions — nearly $80 billion in IRS funding, with $45.6 billion for “enforcement” — has raised questions about who the agency may target for audits.
IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said these resources are “absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans,” in a recent letter to the Senate.
However, with the investment projected to bring in $203.7 billion in revenue from 2022 to 2031, according to the Congressional Budget Office, opponents say IRS enforcement may affect..."
"Sensing Russia’s momentum has completely stalled, the United States is rushing into Ukraine another $775 million in advanced missiles, armored vehicles, and artillery to help Kyiv’s counteroffensive to retake territory, according to a senior defense official.  
There’s “a complete and total lack of progress” by the Russians now, said the official, who briefed Pentagon reporters on Friday. 
The latest weapons package includes additional HIMARS rockets, 16 105mm Howitzer artillery systems, ScanEagle surveillance drones, anti-mine MRAP vehicles, Javelin anti-tank missiles, and more. It follows a $1 billion arms package announced last..."
"S&P 500, Dow fall sharply as investors push U.S. Treasury yields to fresh record lows.
Markets shuddered Monday—with U.S. stocks falling hard enough to trigger a trading halt—as a price war for oil and the economic fallout from the coronavirus frightened investors, who sought shelter in the safety of government bonds and propelled yields to unprecedented lows.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both fell 7% at the open, a drop that triggered circuit breakers that halted trading for 15 minutes. After reopening, stocks fell a bit more,..."
"President Joe Biden will have his first formal press conference as president next week—nine weeks after taking office and longer than any president in modern history.
The White House told reporters about the solo event slated for next Thursday but hasn't yet given a time.
Biden, who was sworn into office on January 20, has answered some shouted questions from reporters at other events or less formal settings, but his Republican rivals have recently questioned why he had gone so long without a lengthier press conference with more questions from..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - National security professionals from across the U.S. government will meet on Tuesday in a Northern Virginia office building for an unprecedented monitoring effort to counter cyberattacks and foreign disinformation aimed at Super Tuesday presidential primaries.
Since U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election - allegations Moscow denies - the U.S. government has introduced measures to combat hacking and foreign propaganda activities designed to affect the vote. Election security experts say that while the government has made improvements, many vulnerabilities still exist.
On Tuesday,..."
"Unless you have been, well, on another planet, you know that July 14 was the date of closest approach to Pluto by the New Horizons spacecraft, which has now sent back unprecedented images from this historic encounter.
Passing Pluto at barely 7,750 miles (or 12,400 kilometers for savvy metric readers), the seven experiments on the New Horizons spacecraft are busily gathering extensive data on Pluto and its five known moons, Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra."
"There wasn’t one Republican presidential debate going on Thursday night in South Carolina, but rather two. And in that sense, the debate neatly and succinctly summarized this year’s unusual race.
The first debate was between the two unlikely front-runners, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. After months of dancing around each other—and in some cases essentially supporting each other—in crystallizing antiestablishment anger, the two now know they are fishing from the same pond with less than three weeks to go before voting begins. And they conducted themselves accordingly.
The night’s second,..."
" I hate to admit it, but it’s true: Donald Trump was right about the monuments.
 Not about monuments to Confederate traitors like Robert E. Lee, whom Trump labeled “a great general.” Nor was he correct in claiming that military bases named after Confederates were “part of a Great American heritage.”
But Trump was right that these attacks would morph into a broader campaign to pull down memorials to the Founders of America, not just to the Southerners who took up arms against it.
“So this week it’s Robert E. Lee,” Trump mused in..."
"Donald Trump has slammed Verizon's decision to drop right-wing network One America News (OAN).
Verizon confirmed last week that it would stop carrying OAN on its Fios television service from July 31.
The move means OAN, a staunchly pro-Trump channel that has been accused of promoting the former president's baseless claims about the 2020 election, is left with almost no television providers.
Trump took to his Truth Social platform, launched after he was banned from Twitter and other sites after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, early on Sunday to..."
"Los Angeles County has dropped a plan for a universal indoor face-mask mandate as COVID cases and hospitalizations have stabilized, with community transmission expected to fall to “medium” from “high” in the coming weeks.
Health Director Barbara Ferrer had said two weeks ago that the U.S.’s most populous county could again require face coverings if trends in hospital admissions continued, under criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the Associated Press reported.
Face masks have become a topic occupying the minds of health experts, educators and local..."
"On the anniversary of 9/11, the 21 years since the horrible attack on our nation reminds us that we still have a great deal of work to do, particularly to protect our country from global catastrophic threats. I was honored and privileged to serve President Bush and Homeland Security Advisor, Gov. Tom Ridge, in the post 9/11 White House, a dramatic and uncertain time to say the least. After Gov. Ridge left Pennsylvania to take leadership of Homeland Security at the White House, he and our team were greeted on Day..."
"A stampede at a soccer stadium in Indonesia has killed at least 125 people and injured more than 320 after police sought to quell violence on the pitch, authorities said on Sunday, in one of the world's worst stadium disasters.
Officers fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse agitated supporters of the losing home side who had invaded the pitch after the final whistle in Malang, East Java, on Saturday night, the region's police chief Nico Afinta told reporters.
""It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged..."
"President Biden on Wednesday called impeachment threats from some House Republicans poised to take control of the chamber “almost comedy,” arguing that the American people are not interested in investigations into him and his family.
“It was reported—whether it’s accurate or not, I’m not sure—but it was reported many times that Republicans are saying and the former president said, how many times you’re gonna impeach Biden?” Biden said at a post-midterm election press conference at the White House. “I think the American people will look at all of that for..."
"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted Thursday that “science is on our side” as she advocated for President Trump’s push to physically reopen schools despite coronavirus concerns.
McEnany also at one point said that the “science should not stand in the way” of schools reopening, a remark she later claimed had been taken out of context by the media.
Trump has vocally advocated for schools to physically reopen over the past week, threatening funding to schools and saying he would put pressure on governors to reopen schools in their..."
"The Alabama Senate on Tuesday evening passed legislation that bans nearly all abortions in the state, sending the measure to Gov. Kay Ivey's (R) desk to be signed into law.
Ivey has not said whether she will sign the measure, which passed by a 25-6 margin. It would ban abortions in virtually all instances in Alabama, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother’s life.
Anyone performing an abortion could be punished by 10 to 99 years in..."
"Barack Obama said during an interview on SiriusXM airing Thursday he'll take the COVID-19 vaccine and ""may end up taking it on TV."" Representatives for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton told CNN they'd also be willing to be inoculated in public.
Why it matters: The former presidents are hoping to instill confidence in the vaccines once authorized for use in the U.S. NIAID director Anthony Fauci has said the U.S. could have herd immunity by the end of next summer or fall if enough people get vaccinated."
"People still looking to book trips home to visit family or take a vacation during the holidays need to act fast and prepare for sticker shock.
Airline executives say that based on bookings, they expect huge demand for flights over Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. Travel experts say the best deals for airfares and hotels are already gone.
On social media, plenty of travelers think they are being gouged. It’s an understandable sentiment when government data shows that airfares in October were up 43% from a year earlier, and U.S. airlines reported a..."
"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- When asked whether they want the police to spend more time, the same amount of time or less time than they currently do in their area, most Black Americans -- 61% -- want the police presence to remain the same. This is similar to the 67% of all U.S. adults preferring the status quo, including 71% of White Americans.
Meanwhile, nearly equal proportions of Black Americans say they would like the police to spend more time in their area (20%) as say they'd like them to spend..."
"DOHA, Qatar—The U.S. and the Taliban signed a historic deal Saturday meant to end America’s longest war and pave the way for Afghan factions to bring 18 years of costly fighting in their country to an end.

"U.S. employers added jobs at a steady pace last month, and the unemployment rate hit a 50-year low, signaling the labor market continues to provide opportunities for Americans in search of work despite a broader economic slowdown.
The U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department reported Friday. The jobless rate dropped to 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August, marking the lowest jobless rate since December 1969, when it also logged in at 3.5%.
Meanwhile, average hourly earnings climbed 2.9% from September 2018, a slowdown from previous..."
"The numbers: The economy added 136,000 new jobs in September, the government said Friday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 150,000 increase.
This is the slowest pace of job growth in four months, as businesses grew more cautious about hiring, but employment gains for August and July revised up by a combined 45,000
And in a separate survey, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, the lowest rate since December 1969. The number of unemployed people fell by 275,00 over the month.

"President Trump on Saturday touted a judge’s ruling on former national security adviser John Bolton’s memoir that allowed the book to proceed with publishing but panned its author as possibly threatening the nation.
“BIG COURT WIN against Bolton. Obviously, with the book already given out and leaked to many people and the media, nothing the highly respected Judge could have done about stopping it...BUT, strong & powerful statements & rulings on MONEY & on BREAKING CLASSIFICATION were made,” Trump tweeted."
"Navy SEAL platoon members painted a dark picture of Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, their leader who was acquitted of war crimes and had a minor charge cleared by President Trump, in leaked investigatory interview videos and text messages obtained by the New York Times.
Why it matters: The interviews, given by members of the platoon members that served under Gallagher, break the SEALs' unwritten code of silence and describe their leader as violent, ""evil"" and ""toxic"" — in contrast with Trump's portrayal of him as a hero.
What they're..."
"Public trust of the U.S. Supreme Court is at a record low, according to a Gallup poll published on Thursday.
Forty-seven percent of adults surveyed earlier this month said that they trust the court, 6 percentage points lower than the previous record low of 53 percent reported in 2015.
Last year, 54 percent of respondents said they had “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of trust in the court.
Job approval for the Supreme Court also dropped in the new poll, tying the previous record low of 40 percent.

"The House passed legislation on Tuesday that would remove artwork from the Capitol that honors people with legacies of defending slavery, including by serving the Confederacy.
The 285-120 vote was bipartisan, but it split Republicans. A minority of 67 Republicans joined with all Democrats in support, while 120 voted against it.

"Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the longest-serving lawmaker in the history of Congress, said he planned to retire after nearly six decades, ending a storied and controversial career spent defending both the auto industry and environmental protection laws.
The departure of Mr. Dingell, 87 years old, will further winnow the House's ranks of veteran, liberal lawmakers, which were already shrinking after California Democrats Henry Waxman and George Miller a"
"A federal judge overturned California’s 32-year-old ban on assault weapons, calling the law unconstitutional in a Friday decision that compared AR-15s to Swiss Army knives, setting the stage for an appeals court battle over one of the country’s oldest assault weapons bans. San Diego judge Roger Benitez, an appointee of President George W. Bush, argued firearms like the AR-15 are “ordinary, popular, modern rifles” and are often useful for self defense and sport, so California’s ban runs afoul of the Second Amendment and the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 D.C. v. Heller decision. The assault weapons ban will not..."
"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Orla Sweeney, manager of Connolly’s Irish pub in New York City, expected St. Patrick’s Day to once again be one of her bar’s most profitable days of the year.
Instead, the pub near Times Square was shuttered on Tuesday, like hundreds of thousands of dining establishments across the United States as state governments enforced closures to control the spread of COVID-19. Sweeney broke the news to her employees on Monday after Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered all restaurants to close that night, and they broke down in..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) congratulated President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Tuesday, marking the first time he has directly acknowledged their victory.

"The Justice Department on Friday said the Treasury Department must turn over former President Trump’s long-sought tax returns to the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee.
In a memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), acting Assistant Attorney General Dawn Johnsen said the Treasury Department was required to defer to the congressional committee.
“The statute at issue here is unambiguous: ‘Upon written request’ of the chairman of one of the three congressional tax committees, the Secretary ‘shall furnish’ the requested tax information to the Committee,” Johnsen wrote in the..."
"About 74% of 469 COVID-19 cases associated with large gatherings held in Barnstable County, Mass., from July 3 to 17 were among fully vaccinated people, according to data released Friday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Why it matters: The data bolsters emerging evidence that vaccinated people have high viral loads and may transmit the Delta variant as easily as those who are unvaccinated.
Be smart: Despite mild breakthrough cases appearing more common than previously thought, ""vaccination is the most important strategy to prevent severe illness and death,"" the report emphasizes...."
"The Obama administration outlined a new compromise Friday aimed at shielding religious business owners and Christian universities and charities from the health law's contraception-coverage requirements, but a chilly initial response from Roman Catholic bishops suggested the move wouldn't assuage their concerns.
Federal officials laid out fresh rules to create a multistep process in which employers opposed to including birth control in workers' insurance would state their objections in writing, and the federal government would take over responsibility for the coverage from there to ensure that employees can still obtain contraception..."
"The effectiveness of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine against infection tumbles over several months, falling from a peak of 88% a month after receiving the two-shot series to 47% six months later, according to an observational study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal The Lancet.
While the two-dose mRNA vaccine’s efficacy against infection wanes, its protection against Covid-related hospitalizations persists, remaining 90% effective for all coronavirus variants of concern — including delta — for at least six months, according to the study, which was funded by Pfizer.
The findings confirm early reports from..."
"President Joe Biden walked back some of his criticism of Facebook, saying Monday he meant to accuse a dozen users, but not the social media platform itself, of spreading deadly lies about Covid vaccines.
“Facebook isn’t killing people,” Biden said.
Biden added that he hopes Facebook will do more to fight “the outrageous misinformation” about coronavirus vaccines being spread on its platform “instead of taking it personally that somehow I’m saying Facebook is killing people.”"
"President Joe Biden insisted Tuesday that the U.S. hasn’t changed its strategic policy on Taiwan, a day after he angered Beijing when he said his administration would be willing to use military force to defend the island.
Biden met with leaders from Japan, India and Australia at their second so-called Quad Leaders’ Summit, which wrapped up Tuesday in Tokyo.
The U.S. president startled many of the delegates when he suggested Monday that the U.S. could deploy American troops on the island should China invade. When asked by a reporter if he “was willing to..."
"The second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by further false or misleading imagery on social media claiming to be from the conflict.
Some show military action taken from older conflicts, while other viral videos have proved difficult to verify.
One video clip seen by the BBC and proven to be several years old has been viewed more than 27 million times in one day, while another showed video game footage.
Misleading posts have come from ""official"" sources as well as from ""ordinary"" social media users...."
"Kamala Harris has always been a trailblazer. As the daughter of immigrant parents – her mother came from India and her father from Jamaica – she was the first woman elected (twice) as California’s attorney general, and the second African American woman elected to the United States Senate, which she entered two years ago. From the moment she got there, the chattering classes began speculating about White House ambitions.
Those lofty expectations seemed justified when she launched her presidential campaign in Oakland, California, in January, drawing an enormous crowd of..."
"BEIRUT—Dozens of people were confirmed dead and thousands more injured after a massive explosion caused by a warehouse fire rocked Lebanon’s capital city of Beirut.
The warehouse held highly explosive material, including sodium nitrate, said an official with Lebanon’s army. He said the explosion was likely caused by a fire, and wasn’t an attack. Sodium nitrate, used to make fertilizer and fireworks, can be explosive and accelerates the burning of other materials, according to the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information.
The blast is the latest blow for Lebanon, a..."
"President Trump on Friday said he had called off a retaliatory military strike on Iran just 10 minutes before its planned start after learning 150 people would be killed, saying such an action would have been disproportionate to Iran’s downing of an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone.
“We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “150 people, sir, was the answer from a General.”
The president said he was in “no hurry” to confront..."
"Haitian President Jovenel Moise was shot dead by unidentified attackers in his private residence overnight in an ""inhuman and barbaric act"" and his wife was injured, Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said on Wednesday.
He said the police and army had the security situation under control but gunshots could be heard throughout the capital after the attack, which occurred amid a rising wave of politically linked violence in the impoverished Caribbean nation.

"Turnout from Georgia’s first day of early voting set a new state record for a midterm election, nearly doubling the figure from the same time period in the previous midterms, state election officials said Tuesday.
More than 131,000 Georgia voters cast ballots since early voting began Monday, according to the office of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The figure represents an 85% boost over the 2018 midterms, when nearly 71,000 early votes were cast on Day One, the office said.
Georgia’s latest tally is also nearly as large as..."
"Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue turned some heads Thursday when, at a White House event, he said, “We are all truly blessed … to have a leader like President Trump.”
Twitter lit up, with a number of influencers and heads of Latino-focused voters’ rights organizations urging people to stop buying from the Latin American-focused food giant.
Unanue “thinks we’re ‘blessed to have a leader’ who’s letting this pandemic kill us, cage our children, and constantly dehumanizes us,” Voto Latino tweeted. “Yo Goya, tell your man to stop praising a racist...."
"The federal government is in the process of deploying 90% of its stockpiled medical equipment to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Health and Human Services spokesperson Katie McKeogh told Axios Wednesday night.
Why it matters: These shipments aren't enough to meet current demands from states, who are bracing for staggered surges in hospital resource demand through May.
Driving the news: The House Oversight Committee published data on Wednesday showing what supplies the stockpile has sent to states so far — including 11 million N95 masks and over 7,000 ventilators, primarily to..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he plans to raise annual refugee admissions to 125,000 in the coming fiscal year, a more than eight-fold increase after former President Donald Trump slashed levels to historic lows.
Biden also called for dozens of changes to U.S. refugee processing and vetting in a detailed executive order that advocates lauded on Thursday. During a speech at the U.S. State Department, the Democratic president said the order would build up the country’s capacity to accept refugees in the face of “unprecedented global need.”

"Senate Democrats are feeling frustrated and disappointed as their effort to retake the majority appears to have fallen short once again.
The likelihood of being relegated to the minority for the next couple years hit home Wednesday when Democratic challenger Sara Gideon conceded to Sen. Susan Collins (R) in the blue state of Maine.
While it now appears Democratic nominee Joe Biden will probably eke out a victory in the presidential race, Democrats were hoping for a bigger night — especially after failing to flip the Senate in 2016..."
"Earlier today, the Justice Department released an extensively redacted version of the affidavit that federal authorities used to justify the warrant to search former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound earlier this month. While it wasn't exactly filled with the kind of bombshells liberals might have been anticipating, Trump allies hoping that more information from the DOJ might reveal the whole thing to be an overreach are likely quite disappointed.
In case there was any doubt, the release makes it clear that there is more going on here than Trump hanging..."
"Frances Haugen is a former Facebook employee who revealed herself as the whistleblower who provided private research documents to The Wall Street Journal for its Facebook Files project. Haugen was a product manager at Facebook until May 2021 and has worked for several major tech and social media companies during her 15-year career. Haugen revealed her identity during an interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes on Sunday, October 3, 2021.

"The number of people seeking and receiving unemployment benefits fell, signs the labor market continues to mend.
The ranks of Americans drawing unemployment benefits declined slightly in the week ended May 30 to 20.9 million, the Labor Department said Thursday.
Though states continue to work through a backlog of claims, new applications for unemployment benefits have trended down since the coronavirus pandemic and related lockdowns triggered a surge in claims at the end of March. About 1.5 million applications were filed last week, compared with a peak of nearly 7..."
"It may not be a presidential or midterm election year, but 2021 has its fair share of important votes happening on Tuesday. Virginia’s gubernatorial election is clearly the most noteworthy race, but several other elections — from legislative races to mayoral campaigns to ballot measures to special elections — could have big consequences as well. 
Tuesday’s main event will happen in Virginia, where Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin are vying to be the commonwealth’s next governor. And the race is pretty much tied, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Virginia polling average, so..."
"Attorney General William Barr has authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities, if they exist, before the 2020 presidential election is certified, despite little evidence of fraud.
Barr’s action comes days after Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump and raises the prospect that Trump will use the Justice Department to try to challenge the outcome. It gives prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding Justice Department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election is certified."
"U.S. Attorney General William Barr has authorized the Department of Justice to investigate ""substantial allegations"" of voting irregularities in this year's presidential election despite little evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press.
In the memo to U.S. attorneys, Barr said investigations ""may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State."""
"Key figures lean toward beginning proceedings after Trump told Don McGahn to defy a congressional subpoena
House Democrats faced a weekly closed-door meeting Tuesday morning prepared for a new round of debate over initiating proceedings for the impeachment of President Trump after former White House counsel Don McGahn said he would honor Mr. Trump’s order that he rebuff a congressional subpoena.
The House Judiciary Committee’s Democrats had already felt that the White House had been thumbing its nose at the committee. But Mr. McGahn’s refusal to appear Tuesday before the..."

"Twitter shares soared more than 20% on news that Elon Musk has bought a 9% stake in the company — the latest business entity to see its stock head for lunar orbit after the Tesla CEO has shown an interest.
Musk hasn’t tweeted about the purchase yet. News of the stake came via a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
But Musk has had plenty to say about Twitter in the past, specifically about whether the company adheres to free speech patterns.
That has led some analysts to suspect he has..."
"The wrangling between the White House and Congress over a $1.1 trillion spending bill is the first test of how political forces unleashed by the midterm elections and impending 2016 campaigns will influence governing here.
The fight foreshadows two years of legislative battles defined by tensions not just between the two parties—as has been the case since the Republican takeover of the House in 2010—but within them.
As Senate leaders attempted Friday to win support for quick passage of a House bill to fund most of the government through next..."
"The Biden administration could certainly have better planned the extraction of civilians from Afghanistan. Yet media and politicians portray the fall of Afghanistan as a broader strategic debacle for U.S. foreign policy and President Joe Biden. They say America’s abandonment of the elected government in Kabul undermines U.S. efforts to support democracy elsewhere; harms U.S. alliance commitments; will be a boon for terrorists, and is likely to result in massive human rights violations. 
These criticisms exaggerate the fallout. Responsibility for the current mess does not lie primarily with those who decided to face the reality of an..."
"During a press conference on Wednesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott detailed his plan for building a wall on the border the state shares with Mexico. He also tore in President Joe Biden's handling of the influx of migrants coming into the country and demanded the president ""return Texas land to Texas.""
The Republican governor also announced that Texas is funding a $250 million down payment to help pay for a border wall. ""It's more than enough to hire a project manager and contractor to begin building the wall. We are committed to adding more resources..."
"Lake County teenager Kyle Rittenhouse on Thursday was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and a host of other charges following shootings in Kenosha where two people died and another was wounded during violent demonstrations over Sunday’s police shooting of Jacob Blake.

The 17-year-old from Antioch is charged with: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18."
"Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 245,000 in November, well below Wall Street estimates as rising coronavirus cases coincided with a considerable slowdown in hiring.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 440,000 and the jobless rate to decrease to 6.7% from 6.9% in October.
The unemployment rate met expectations, though it fell along with a drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.5%. A more encompassing measure of joblessness edged lower to 12% while the number of Americans outside the labor force remains just above 100 million."
"Justice Department officials’ unwavering resistance to former President Trump’s attempts to use their agency to legitimize his bid to remain in office will be the focus of Thursday’s hearing from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
“In the remaining weeks of the transition, President Trump tried to pressure the Department of Justice and help him overturn the 2020 election,” a select committee aide told reporters Wednesday."
"For a while now, there have been rumblings that President Joe Biden will declare a climate emergency in the U.S.
Senate Democrats are urging him to do so after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin's refusal last week to back his party's spending plans to tackle climate change.
The president could declare this soon in an attempt to save and push forward his environmental agenda.
An emergency order would allow Biden to direct federal funding to clean-energy projects and give him broad powers to restrict oil drilling and curb fossil fuel flows, Bloomberg reported."
"US President Donald Trump has reportedly fired the director of the US Secret Service.
Randolph Alles is one of several Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials being ousted on Monday, says the BBC's US affiliate, CBS News.
Mr Alles' departure comes a day after DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tendered her resignation under pressure over the situation at the US-Mexico border.

"For the first time in more than 60 years, Cuba is poised to have a government without a single Castro.
Raúl Castro, who succeeded his brother Fidel as the Communist Party of Cuba’s first secretary in 2011, is expected to step down from his post as the country begins its eighth Communist Party Congress on Friday.

"The long-time financial chief of Donald Trump's company has pleaded guilty to fraud and tax evasion charges at a New York court.
Allen Weisselberg, who served as The Trump Organization's chief financial officer, had been charged with concealing more than $1.7m (£1.4m) in off-the-books income.

"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized Pfizer's antiviral pill for the treatment of individuals at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Why it matters: At-home COVID-19 treatments, especially Pfizer's Paxlovid, are seen as possible game-changers for the pandemic. The emergency use authorization comes as the U.S. sees a surge in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations largely driven by the Omicron variant.
Driving the news: Pfizer released new data last week confirming Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% in high-risk adults, Axios' Tina Reed reports.

"Bringing children to drag shows could be criminalized in Florida.
Driving the news: State Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R-Howey-in-the-Hills) said he plans to propose legislation to make bringing a child to a drag show a felony with the potential to terminate parental rights.

This comes a day after a Texas lawmaker announced his plan to introduce legislation to ban minors from attending drag shows in the state, citing videos of a..."
"In a striking policy shift that ensured the rancorous spy-policy debate would extend into the fall, President Barack Obama announced plans to overhaul key parts the National Security Agency's surveillance programs.
The proposal—an extraordinary step in the face of this year's revelations from fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden—drew sharp responses from Republican lawmakers who suggested the president was retreating under political pressure. The tone of the reaction from Republicans and skeptical Democrats suggested Mr. Obama has a new fight on his hands, reminiscent of the two-year battle that preceded reforms..."
"Charitable giving has spiked as fast as the virus, filling in the gaps of government response to the crisis.
In a pandemic, everyone is a responder, even if he or she is self-isolating. Yet for many people during the coronavirus outbreak, the response has been outward. According to the research group Candid, global giving to combat the outbreak and deal with the economic fallout has reached $1.3 billion in a matter of weeks. That’s far higher than for recent disasters such as the Australian bushfires or the 2014 Ebola outbreak...."
"Citing the need to assure Americans that elections will no longer be “rigged” — despite the lack of evidence of widespread fraud in 2020 — Republican lawmakers in 43 states have introduced 253 bills to restrict ballot access. The greatest activity has been in battleground states, especially Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. Measures involve early voting, mail-in ballots, drop boxes, mobile voting facilities, and rules to disqualify ballots received after Election Day that cannot be overruled by the executive branch or the courts. They have the greatest potential impact on poor..."
"The Obama campaign is hitting back hard in response to a Romney ad in which the GOP candidate presents himself as more moderate on abortion rights, explaining that he thinks that abortion should be legal for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, or if life of the mother is in jeopardy.
The Romney campaign says thats long been his position, and Republicans accuse the Obama campaign of distorting his views. In at least one earlier ad, the Obama campaign charged that Mitt Romney is opposed to all abortion."

"Senate Democrats on Tuesday are expected to roll out an IRS enforcement proposal that is narrower in scope than a version unveiled earlier this year by the Biden administration, following criticism from Republicans and banking groups.
The Biden administration had proposed requiring financial institutions to report more information about bank accounts to the IRS, in cases where the accounts had more than $600 in withdrawals and deposits in a year. Senate Democrats are planning to increase that threshold to $10,000 and exempt wage income, a Democratic aide told The Hill.

"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison on Friday afternoon for the murder of George Floyd last May. 
Handed down by Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill, the sentence was greater than what legal experts predicted.
“Determining the appropriate sentence in any case and in this case is a legal analysis. It's applying the rule of law to the facts of an individual and specific case,” Cahill said from the Hennepin County courthouse just after 2:30 p.m. “This sentence is not based on emotion or sympathy.

"Elon Musk has claimed he was just following the ""recommendation"" of a Ukrainian ambassador who told him to ""f**k off,"" following reports SpaceX could stop funding Starlink coverage for Ukraine.
According to CNN, SpaceX wrote to the Pentagon last month requesting the U.S. military pick up the tab, which the company says comes to tens of millions of dollars each month.
On Friday, Jason Jay Smart, a Ukraine-based reporter at the Kyiv Post, tweeted: ""Elon Musk's Starlink says it can no longer afford to give Ukraine [Ukraine flag emoji] free..."
"The Biden administration has bought enough doses of COVID-19 vaccines to cover 300 million people in the US by the end of July, President Joe Biden said Thursday afternoon, though this doesn't mean everyone will be vaccinated by then.
""We've now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans,"" Biden said.
Actually administering the vaccines to all Americans could take longer because vaccinations are managed at a state and local level.
""Just this afternoon, we signed the final contracts for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines,""..."
"Thursday night was the night when the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation was finally released for the world to see. Those that have time reading through novel-length interview transcripts will find one clear thread — Hollywood Rep Adam Schiff had nothing on President Trump with regards to him or his campaign working in cahoots with Russia, or Russians, to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016.
The release came after the Department of Justice and Director of National Intelligence threw many buckets of cold water on the Russia investigation last week...."
"The U.S. intelligence community does not believe it can resolve a debate over whether a Chinese laboratory incident was the source of COVID-19 without more information, U.S. officials said in a declassified summary on Friday.
U.S. officials said only China can help solve questions about the true origins of the virus that has now killed 4.6 million people worldwide. ""China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19,"" they said.
President Joe Biden, who received a classified report earlier this week summarizing the investigation he..."
"Is the Covid-19 pandemic over?
President Biden told Scott Pelley of “60 Minutes” it was. The Sunday night interview aired just days after the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the end may be in sight — though Tedros clearly didn’t mean it was days away when he predicted it.
But how confident can we be that the pandemic is or will soon be over? How can we know we’ve reached “over” when the disease we’ve been fighting isn’t going away?
Reaching the end of a pandemic is..."
"A bipartisan group of senators trying to find 60 votes for a legislative response to recent mass shootings is honing in on a proposal to provide grants for states to implement so-called red flag laws that would allow courts to order the temporary seizure of firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others. 
Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have teamed up on red flag law legislation in recent years but have never found enough Republican support to get the votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the..."
"President Donald Trump said on Monday that he plans to display battle tanks on Washington’s National Mall as part of a pumped-up Fourth of July celebration that will also feature flyovers by fighter jets and other displays of military prowess.
The military hardware is just one new element in a U.S. Independence Day pageant that will depart significantly from the nonpartisan, broadly patriotic programs that typically draw hundreds of thousands of people to the monuments in downtown Washington.
While past presidents have traditionally kept a low profile on July 4,..."
"Jobless claims hovered above pre-pandemic levels last week as employers avoid layoffs and many workers quit or remain sidelined in a tight labor market.
Initial claims for jobless benefits edged down to seasonally adjusted 268,000 last week from a revised 269,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims are at the lowest level since the pandemic hit the U.S. economy last spring and are gradually drifting down toward pre-pandemic levels.
Though worker filings for unemployment benefits remain above their 2019 weekly average of 218,000, the recovery in claims..."
"The U.S. Senate will begin up to two days of questioning the prosecution and defense in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial on Wednesday, ahead of a crucial vote later in the week on whether to call witnesses.
The questions, which will alternate between Republican and Democratic senators, will be submitted in writing and read aloud by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial to determine if Trump should be removed from office.
The questions can be directed at either the Democratic House prosecutors or Trump’s legal..."
"South Africa said Saturday it's being ""punished"" for detecting the new Omicron coronavirus variant as more countries rush to enact travel bans and restrictions.
Driving the news: The U.S. imposed air travel restrictions from eight countries Friday in response to the Omicron variant. Countries in Europe and Asia have also implemented their own travel restrictions in response to Omicron.
The United Kingdom announced Saturday that two cases of the new variant were detected in the country with a ""link to travel to Southern Africa.""
The variant has also been found in Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.

"Liberals on Tuesday sent a stern warning to Democratic leaders that a bipartisan infrastructure bill cannot pass through the House as long as Senate centrists remain noncommittal on the larger social benefits package at the heart of President Biden's agenda. 
""If she were to call the bill, it will fail,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a close ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said leaving a closed-door House Democratic Caucus meeting. ""Not because the Progressive Caucus, people like me, aren't willing to vote for it. But ... we had an agreement that we were going to..."
"Recently, an image that listed books banned in Florida libraries and schools began making the rounds on Twitter. The 25 titles, spanning classics from “To Kill a Mockingbird” to “A Wrinkle in Time,” caught the eyes of many, including Randi Weingarten, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, a major teacher’s labor union in the U.S.
Only one problem: The list was fake. There is no banned-book list at the state level in Florida.
This isn’t to say that books haven’t been banned in Florida public schools. Earlier..."
"Airlines on Tuesday detailed the growing impact of the coronavirus by cutting more flights in domestic and international markets, parking planes, freezing hiring and reducing executive pay.
American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. both said they planned to reduce the number of flights across their networks."
"Veterans and retirees will see an 8.7% cost-of-living increase in their Social Security benefits starting in December, the largest increase in 42 years, federal officials announced on Thursday.
The big boost reflects the rising cost of inflation throughout the last year. In a statement, acting Social Security Administration Commissioner Kilolo Kijakazi said the move will give beneficiaries “more peace of mind and breathing room.”
The move will directly affect about 65 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits. Administration officials said the average beneficiary will see an increase of about $140 in their monthly payouts...."
"Apanel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave a rare preferential recommendation to the Covid vaccines based on messenger RNA technology on Thursday — a decision aimed at steering people away from the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine because of concerns about a rare but serious side effect.
The recommendation passed by a unanimous vote, with all 15 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices supporting it.
The recommendation levels another blow to J&J’s vaccine, which has struggled to find a foothold in the U.S. market...."
"The Biden administration will open up U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico to non-essential travel starting in November — but only to those fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Why it matters: Government officials and business leaders have decried the economic impact pandemic travel restrictions have had on border communities. They have called for the U.S. to reopen the borders given high, and rising, vaccinations rates there.
What's happening: Officials will implement land border vaccine requirements in two phases, an administration official told reporters on a Tuesday evening call.
Early next month, non-essential travelers from Mexico..."
"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that House Republicans will not write “a blank check” to Ukraine if they take control of the lower chamber next year, marking one of the clearest signs that aid to the war-torn country fighting off a Russian invasion will face a much tougher road in a GOP-led House.
“I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won’t do it,” McCarthy, who hopes to become Speaker if Republicans win..."
"Democratic and Republican staff in Congress are drafting language for possible police-overhaul legislation that would limit the transfer of some military equipment to local departments, ban police use of chokeholds except in life-threatening situations and set federal standards for so-called no-knock warrants, according to people familiar with the talks.
Final language on those measures that would be incorporated in a compromise bill between lawmakers from both sides hasn’t yet been set. And central issues concerning the prosecution and liability of individual police officers remain to be resolved, the people said...."
"Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo pleaded with world leaders on Tuesday to respect international laws and avert a “cold war”, as Southeast Asia’s biggest economy kicked off one of the trickiest G20 summits since the economic forum’s inception more than two decades ago.
In front of dozens of leaders gathered on the Indonesian island of Bali, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, Widodo said it took “extraordinary efforts” to get everyone together in the same room.
“Today the eyes of the world are fixed upon our meeting. Are we going to achieve success, or..."
"The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request from House Democrats for immediate access to redacted grand jury materials from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.
The justices instead granted the Trump administration's request to continue shielding the secret grand jury transcripts and exhibits, further postponing a lower court’s disclosure order.
The Wednesday order also gave the Justice Department until June 1 to file a formal appeal of the March ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the administration must hand over the materials the Democratic-led..."
"President Trump on Thursday said he would focus on ensuring a smooth transition to the incoming Biden administration following violent attacks by a mob of his supporters that stormed the Capitol on Wednesday.
Trump, in taped remarks released on social media, condemned the violence that unfolded at the Capitol building but did not specifically name a group that caused the mayhem.
Trump called for calm, and for the first time, he said publicly that it was time to move on from the 2020 election.
""We have just been through..."
"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday issued a memo ordering U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop mass worksite raids.
Driving the news: Mayorkas said the Biden administration would instead focus on pursuing employers who hire and take advantage of immigrants without work authorizations, rather than the employees.
State of play: DHS said in the memo that it is also considering options to offer protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants who witness or are victims of ""abusive or exploitable labor practices.""
What they're saying: ""We will not tolerate unscrupulous employers who exploit unauthorized workers,..."
"Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami are among cities anticipating raids; orders include detention and deportations, administration officials say.
WASHINGTON—Immigration and Customs Enforcement will launch an effort to round up thousands of undocumented migrants across the country on Sunday as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, according to three administration officials.
Details of this weekend’s operations remain unknown, but the officials said that the orders include detention and deportations. One of the officials said ICE has been ordered to go after people “who received a final order of..."
"Secretary of State John Kerry has made a significant mistake in how he’s pursuing a Gaza cease-fire — and it’s not surprising that he has upset both the Israelis and some moderate Palestinians.
Kerry’s error has been to put so much emphasis on achieving a quick halt to the bloodshed that he has solidified the role of Hamas, the intractable, unpopular Islamist group that leads Gaza, along with the two hard-line Islamist nations that are its key supporters, Qatar and Turkey. In the process, he has undercut not simply the..."
"A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that President Trump cannot block enforcement of a New York grand jury subpoena for eight years of his tax returns.
The ruling, from a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, affirms a federal judge's decision in August that rejected Trump's claims that the subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. (D) was overly broad and issued in bad faith.
The parties have agreed to temporarily halt enforcement of the subpoena.
The Manhattan District Attorney's Office last..."
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed it was the Obama administration that began the practice of separating migrant children from adults at the U.S.-Mexico border, a contention nonpartisan fact-checkers call “misleading.”
“Just so you understand, President Obama separated the children. Those cages that were shown — I think they were very inappropriate — were by President Obama’s administration, not by Trump. President Obama had child separation.
“Take a look. The press knows it. You know it. We all know it. I’m the one who stopped it. President Obama had child..."
"Voting-machine company Smartmatic USA Corp. sued Fox Corp.’s Fox News, seeking $2.7 billion in damages for what it alleges were defamatory on-air comments about the company’s products in the aftermath of the presidential election.
The suit, filed Thursday in a New York court, focuses on a series of statements made about Smartmatic on Fox News by lawyers who supported former President Donald Trump’s claims that the election was rigged, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. The lawsuit also mentions remarks made about Smartmatic by Fox News Media anchors including Lou..."
"Capitol police are anticipating the People's Convoy, a group of anti-COVID mandate protesters, to arrive in Washington, D.C., earlier than the truckers' scheduled trajectory.
U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are preparing for protesters to begin popping up at the Capitol ahead of President Joe Biden's State of the Union Address to Congress on March 1, even though the timeline from the People's Convoy estimates that they will arrive in the D.C. area the evening of March 5.
Protesters were planning to gather on Wednesday morning in Adelanto, California, before traveling across the country to demand that..."
"Bhasha Mewar has had it with doctors. Over the past two years, Mewar has spent nearly all of her life savings seeing heart and respiratory specialists, haematologists, urologists, dermatologists and more, in a desperate bid to tame her long-COVID symptoms. She has taken a slew of drugs: beta blockers to calm her racing heart, steroid inhalers to ease her laboured breathing and an antimalarial drug prescribed to her for reasons she never fully understood.
And when Mewar — a curator at an art museum in Ahmedabad, India, who has been..."
"President Trump said he plans to address the country on Wednesday morning after Iran claimed responsibility for the launch of missiles at a pair of military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops and coalition personnel, a marked escalation in the conflict between the two countries following the U.S.'s killing of a top Iranian general.
The Pentagon in a statement said Iran had ""launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq,"" adding, ""It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted..."
"Special Counsel John Durham alleged in a court filing last week that a lawyer for Democrats shared data with a federal agency allegedly showing the use of Russian-made phones near the White House in 2017.
The February 11 filing also accuses attorney Michael Sussmann of lying to the FBI in September 2016, when he said he was not working ""for any client"" when he presented the agency with purported evidence of covert communications between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank.
Former President Donald Trump has always said he was unfairly smeared by Hillary Clinton's campaign and..."
"President Obama’s brave and principled decision to commute Chelsea Manning’s remaining 35-year prison sentence highlights the equally strong need to pardon whistleblower Edward Snowden. Offering a pardon for Snowden on the eve of Trump’s inauguration would not only be equally brave and principled, it would restore the value of truth and ethics at a time when these essential elements of democracy are more necessary, and more precarious, than ever before."
"One year from now, we will all exhale with exhaustion, looking back at a 2016 that kept the entire world on edge. Maybe 2017 will bring more calm, we will muse, knowing that a brand new U.S. president will usher in a change in policies for addressing intensifying global conflicts that America cannot afford to ignore."
"US Senate lawmakers have approved a massive spending plan to boost technology research and production.
The proposed measures come in the face of growing international competition, particularly from China.
A Beijing official hit back at the bill on Wednesday, saying it ""exaggerated the 'China threat'"".
The bill, which must pass the House of Representatives before being signed into law, is a rare point of agreement between Republicans and Democrats.
In a vote in the upper chamber of the US Congress, 68 of the 100-member Senate supported the measure, with 32..."
"U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a new infrastructure offer on Thursday that would spend $928 billion over eight years to revitalize America's roads, bridges and broadband systems, still well below President Joe Biden's last proposal.
The plan, from a group of six Republicans led by Senator Shelley Moore Capito, represents their counter-offer to a week-old $1.7 trillion White House proposal that slashed more than $500 billion from Biden's original $2.25 trillion plan in a bid to reach a bipartisan agreement.
""Senate Republicans continue to negotiate in good faith,"" Capito told a news conference...."
"Billions of dollars in federal funds earmarked for boosting nationwide Covid-19 testing remain unspent months after Congress made the money available, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In April, Congress allocated roughly $25 billion for federal agencies and states to expand testing, develop contact-tracing initiatives and broaden disease surveillance.
According to HHS data, only about 10% to 15% of that total has been drawn down, meaning the cash has been spent or committed to various efforts. The funds for various testing initiatives were part of the..."
"Former White House adviser Steve Bannon lashed out on Friday at the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, hours after a jury found him guilty of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with the committee's investigation.
Driving the news: “I support Trump and the Constitution and if they want to put me in jail for that, so be it,” Bannon told Fox News host Tucker Carlson during Friday's episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight.
What he’s saying: In his remarks, Bannon implied there would be retribution for those involved with the bipartisan commission."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fell short of winning any delegates in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, raising new questions about their viability as presidential candidates ahead of a long slog toward the next contests on the calendar.
The results of Tuesday's vote, in which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) narrowly held off former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, represented a substantial blow to both Biden and Warren. Their vote totals combined did not equal the surprise third-place finisher, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who surged after..."
"The attack on a Rabbi in Monsey north of New York City on Saturday evening has left the Jewish community shaken. It follows at least eight other attacks in New York since the shooting attack on a kosher supermarket in early December. There have been near daily attacks in New York City this year, a kind of slow-moving pogrom against Jews, particularly targeting ultra-Orthodox Jews.
The murder of three people at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City was mostly ignored in the United States. No rallies or marches against..."
"The Supreme Court on Friday freed a group of Roman Catholic nonprofit organizations from complying with the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive provisions while they pursue a challenge to the law before a federal appeals court.
The 2010 federal health-care law requires that plans include contraceptive coverage. Nonprofit employers that claim religious objections to contraception can opt out of paying for their employees to receive such benefits by filing a form with the Labor Department. Insurers generally must still provide employees the coverage, however, and in many cases can obtain reimbursement..."
"Later this week, U.S. President Joe Biden will convene leaders from over one hundred countries spanning the world’s regions to discuss the decline of global democracy—and announce commitments for renewing democracy domestically and internationally. But each participant faces its own democratic challenges, including, as Biden notes, the United States. What do different countries and regions make of the summit? And what would it take for the summit to succeed?"
"U.S. consumer spending fell in December, suggesting the economy lost speed heading into the new year amid snarled supply chains and raging COVID-19 infections, while annual inflation increased at a pace last seen nearly 40 years ago.
Wage inflation is also building up amid an acute shortage of workers. Private industry wages rose strongly in the fourth quarter, posting their largest annual gain since the mid-1980s, other data showed on Friday. Mounting inflation pressures could force the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates, stifling growth, economists warned.
""No one..."
"The case that New York prosecutors have leveled against former President Donald Trump’s business empire and the company’s finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, is a reminder that corporations not only share rights enjoyed by individuals but they can also be indicted like people too.
The 15-count indictment made public Thursday charges the company and its longtime chief financial officer with evading payroll and income taxes over a 16-year stretch by paying off-the-book benefits to Mr. Weisselberg and other executives.
It alleges that the company skimmed payroll taxes by concealing compensation—in the form of..."
"President Joe Biden's administration said on Monday that it had transferred its first detainee from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, a Moroccan man who had been imprisoned since 2002, bringing the population at the facility down to 39.
Set up to house foreign suspects following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, the prison came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. “war on terror” because of harsh interrogation methods critics say amounted to torture.
While Trump kept the prison open during his four years..."
"Former President Obama is being honored with a new state holiday in his former state of Illinois. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) signed a measure Friday to make Aug. 4 “Barack Obama Day” in the state, according to NBC Chicago. The holiday will be celebrated each year on Obama’s birthday beginning in 2018."
"Democratic candidates in a pair of U.S. Senate runoff races in Georgia on Monday challenged the two incumbent Republican senators to debates ahead of a Jan. 5 vote that will decide control of the Senate.
Democrat Jon Ossoff said he had accepted invitations from six media outlets to debates, and urged Republican rival Senator David Perdue to join him in the forums. He had already called Perdue a “coward” on Twitter Sunday following media reports that Perdue had declined a chance to debate on Dec. 6 at the Atlanta Press..."
"The United States and Russia faced off at the U.N. Security Council Monday over Washington's accusations that Moscow is planning a large-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine, which the Kremlin has denied.
""The situation we're facing in Europe is urgent and dangerous, and the stakes for Ukraine – and for every U.N. member state – could not be higher,"" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told council members."
"Live on his show Wednesday, Infowars host Alex Jones mocked a jury ordering him to pay $965 million in a defamation suit brought by Sandy Hook families, cheering as the judge listed off millions in damages for each count.
“Get those numbers up,” Jones said after one count was read, at times giving a thumbs up and raising his hand in the air.
A Connecticut jury on Wednesday ordered Jones to pay the damages to the family of victims of the 2012 Newtown, Conn., school shooting for repeatedly claiming the..."
"Four senators sold stocks shortly after a January Senate briefing on the novel coronavirus outbreak, unloading shares that plummeted in value a month later as the stock market crashed in the face of a global pandemic.
According to financial disclosures, Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) each sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks within days of the Senate holding a classified briefing on Jan. 24 with administration officials on the threat of the coronavirus outbreak.
The sales raise questions about..."
"For the second time in three years, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of religious schools seeking access to public education money in a decision that will further complicate efforts to keep religious organizations from receiving state funds.
Justices in the majority said that a Maine law limiting the participation of faith-based private schools in the state’s unique public education system violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.
“Maine’s ‘nonsectarian’ requirement for its otherwise generally available tuition assistance payments ... operates to identify and exclude otherwise..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Maine cannot exclude religious schools from a state tuition assistance program, the latest case signaling the conservative court’s shift on religious freedom and separation of church and state.
The 6-3 opinion, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., found the program unconstitutional because it provided vouchers parents could spend at private or public schools but excluded schools with explicitly religious instruction.
The Supreme Court found that Maine’s program violated the Free Exercise Clause in the First Amendment because it prohibits the schools from..."
"Former New York City mayor and onetime Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani weighed in on the VP debate, saying Sen. Marco Rubio is his top pick.
On a slower day for vice presidential speculation, former New York City mayor and onetime Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani weighed in on the VP debate.
Appearing on “CBS This Morning, Mr. Giuliani said he liked all of the potential nominees, and mentioned a few names including Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), but then said: “I kinda prefer Marco Rubio, citing the Florida senators..."
"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he wants the Food and Drug Administration to move “as quickly as they can” to approve Gilead Sciences’ antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for the coronavirus.
“We would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things that work,” he said at a roundtable at the White House with business executives Wednesday evening.
Earlier in the day, the FDA said it has been in “sustained and ongoing” discussions with Gilead to make remdesivir available to Covid-19 patients “as quickly as possible, as appropriate.”..."
"Group of Seven (G-7) leaders on Sunday called for a renewed, ""transparent"" investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and pledged to give 1 billion vaccine doses to countries in need as their weekend of meetings in the United Kingdom came to an end.
President Biden joined the leaders of the U.K., Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and France in signing a joint communique that addressed the group's commitments on the pandemic, climate change, ransomware and corruption.
The leaders called for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based [World Health Organization]-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins..."
"The Supreme Court is considering hearing “a group of nine cases that in one way or another all challenge current qualified immunity doctrine, under which law enforcement officials are not liable for discretionary actions that allegedly violated someone’s rights unless the actions violated ‘clearly established’ law.”
Both sides argue for an end to qualified immunity:
“When Floyd’s family goes to court to hold the officers liable for their actions, a judge in Minnesota may very well dismiss their claims. Not because the officers didn’t do anything wrong, but because..."
"IN THE LAST WEEK OF APRIL, nearly 23 percent of all traffic to news sites tracked by web analytics firm Parse.ly came from search engines. Google alone accounts for nearly half of external referral traffic—traffic, that is, that comes from platforms, apps, and other outside sources— to news sites. Together with the fact that Facebook referral traffic is on the wane, this means that Google’s search algorithm is now perhaps the most powerful mediator of online attention to news.
But for all the influence Google has in directing attention, we..."
"A tense phone conversation between a reporter for the Washington Examiner and White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was published by the newspaper on Thursday.
In the conversation, Conway objected that a story written by the reporter, Caitlin Yilek, mentioned that her husband George Conway is a fierce critic of President Trump on Twitter.
Yilek was writing a story on Conway possibly becoming President Trump's next White House chief of staff if Trump decides to move on from the official now in the position, Mick Mulvaney."
"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Obama administration, accusing it of illegally manipulating federal grant money and regulations to force states to adopt educational standards known as the Common Core.
The legal challenge puts Mr. Jindal, who is considering a 2016 presidential bid, at the forefront of a dispute between conservatives and President Barack Obama, bolstering the governor's profile on the issue as he is trying to court conservative voters nationwide."
"A Jewish man was allegedly assaulted by a group of pro-Palestinian protesters in New York City, as demonstrators from both sides clashed following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
On Thursday evening, Twitter user @Robertrand77, whose screen name is Rob Bertrand, posted a video to Twitter that appeared to show a man being beaten in Times Square.
The video was then shared by former NY State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who alleged that it showed a group of pro-Palestinian protesters assaulting a Jewish man.
The footage showed a group of people carrying..."
"Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked a sweeping bill to overhaul federal elections, ratcheting up already inflamed tensions over voting rights. 
Senators voted 50-50 in the evenly divided Senate on advancing the For the People Act, splitting along party lines and failing to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a GOP filibuster. 
The vote is the culmination of weeks of partisan rancor and behind-the-scenes talks over changing the nation's voting laws in the wake of the 2020 presidential election."
"John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate change, is facing calls for his resignation from Republican lawmakers and pundits for reportedly discussing Israeli military operations with Iran’s foreign minister when he served as then-President Obama’s secretary of State.
Republican blowback is running the gamut from calling for Kerry to leave his position as the top official addressing climate change to calling for an investigation and his prosecution. Biden administration officials are dismissing the allegations, saying the information Kerry allegedly shared was widely known at the time.
Sen. Dan..."
"Video posted to social media shows that President Donald Trump's speech in Texas was attended by a crowd who largely refused to wear masks or maintain social distancing in a tightly packed area.
Trump delivered a speech on ""restoring energy dominance"" during an event at the Double Eagle Energy oil rig in Midland, Texas on Wednesday.
Video posted to Twitter shortly after the event by The Hill appears to show very few of the attendees wearing face coverings despite the recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Texas. There also seemed..."
"Mr Sanders was treated in hospital for an arterial blockage after experiencing chest pain at an event in Nevada on Tuesday.
An adviser for the Vermont senator said he was in ""good spirits"" and will be resting over the next few days.
Mr Sanders had earlier announced his campaign has raised over $25m (£20m).
Senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement: ""Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted.""
Mr Weaver said Mr Sanders is ""conversing..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday truncated the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to regulate greenhouse gases. The ruling may hamper President Joe Biden’s plan to fight climate change and could limit the authority of federal agencies across the executive branch.
By a vote of 6-3, the court agreed with Republican-led states and coal companies that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was wrong when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to give the EPA expansive power over carbon emissions. The decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts,..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court opened what promises to be an eventful new term on Monday, hearing arguments in an environmental dispute, welcoming a history-making justice to the bench and taking up some new cases to be decided in the next nine months.
President Joe Biden's appointee Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman justice, took part in oral arguments for the first time since being confirmed by the Senate in April to replace now-retired Justice Stephen Breyer. Jackson was not shy, posing questions to lawyers appearing in the first of two cases argued on..."
"Rep. Liz Cheney may be about to lose her day job. If so, she’s totally OK with that.
Cheney, a third-term Wyoming Republican, is charging into Tuesday’s primary in the Cowboy State defiantly embracing the very message that’s sparked the conservative backlash brewing to oust her: Namely, that former President Trump, with his baseless claims of a “stolen” election, poses an existential threat to the country’s democratic foundations and should be barred from holding future office.
That argument, combined with Cheney’s national prominence, has made her both the public face..."
"Joe Biden is getting flak for his stance on busing. But segregated schools aren’t the root cause of educational inequity, and integration alone isn’t enough to address it.
At the Democratic Presidential debate last week, Kamala Harris took on Joe Biden for his opposition to court-ordered busing. At the debate, Biden defended his position with what sounded like a reference to states’ rights, a phrase that has historically served as a cover for racism. In the past, though, he’s offered a different rationale—one that sounds strikingly similar to arguments advanced..."
"Tensions with China are at their worst in 40 years, Taiwan's defence minister has said, warning of the risk of an accidental strike between the two.
Chiu Kuo-cheng's comments came after China sent a ""record number"" of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four consecutive days.
Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state. China, however, views Taiwan as a breakaway province.
It has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.
While Chinese jets have not been flown all the way to the island, Mr Chiu warned..."
"Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate David McCormick has conceded to Mehmet Oz, handing the GOP nomination to the celebrity doctor backed by former President Donald Trump.
McCormick announced his concession before a recount of the election night results—which saw Oz leading by a razor-thin margin of less than 1,000 votes—was completed. Hours before McCormick conceded, a report from The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the recount had ""produced little change in the tally.""
""We came so close to the goal,"" McCormick said to a crowd of supporters on Friday evening. ""But it's now clear to me, with the recount..."
"President Biden will unveil a $2 trillion infrastructure plan centered on fixing roads and bridges, expanding broadband internet access and boosting funding for research and development, while proposing an expansive increase in corporate taxes to pay for the package.
Mr. Biden will unveil the proposal during a Wednesday afternoon speech in Pittsburgh, where he kicked off his presidential campaign. He is expected to make the case that the investments are necessary to help the U.S. compete with China and tackle climate change.
The measure, which comes after Mr. Biden signed..."
"As weary U.S. military planners wrapped up the evacuation and pullout from Afghanistan one year ago, officials across the government steeled themselves for intense public scrutiny into how America's longest war ended in shambles with the Taliban retaking power.
But as the United States marks the first anniversary of the withdrawal this month, some U.S. officials and experts say President Joe Biden's administration has moved on without properly assessing lessons from the 20-year war and the Taliban victory.
Nor has there been public accountability for the chaotic evacuation operation that..."
"President Trump used a campaign rally in North Carolina on Wednesday to stoke his supporters’ anger over a group of four minority, progressive Democratic congresswomen, drawing boos and chants of “send her back” when he ramped up his attacks.
The scene laid bare Trump’s effort to use the group to frame Democrats as extreme ahead of the 2020 election but also fueled the notion that he is seeking to exploit the nation’s racial divisions for political gain.
“The leading voices of the Democrat Party are left-wing extremists who reject everything..."
"Despite its designation as a federal holiday, few states recognize Juneteenth, the celebration of the effective end of slavery in the U.S., as a paid holiday.
There’s a chance that you may not have seen this story depending on where you get your news. Ten left-leaning and five right-leaning outlets have reported on the topic, according to a report from NewsNation partner Ground News’ Blindspot. The majority of reports, 71%, came from outlets aligned in the center of the political spectrum.
Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, marks the day in 1865..."
"Presidential record keepers confirmed Friday that there were classified national security documents among the 15 boxes recently retrieved from Mar-a-Lago as former President Trump has been directed to release his communications to the Jan. 6 House committee.
The statement from the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA) comes as the House Oversight Committee last week launched a probe into Trump’s handling of presidential records — and it also confirms the agency has contacted the Justice Department.
“NARA has identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes,” National Archivist David Ferriero..."
"Nonfarm payrolls rose by 128,000 in October as the U.S. economy overcame the weight of the GM autoworkers’ strike and created jobs at a pace well above expectations.
Even with a decline of 42,000 in the motor vehicles and parts industry, the pace of new jobs well exceeded the estimate of 75,000 from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The loss of jobs came due to the General Motors strike that has since been settled. That 42,000 job loss itself was less than the 50,000 or more that many economists had..."
"Independence Day weekend is expected to be the second busiest for travel since 2000, with flight delays, cancelations and staffing woes.
Why it matters: It's a sign that the summer of ""revenge travel"" is upon us, with Americans splurging on travel and enduring delays to make up for pandemic-related cancellations.
The big picture: Airlines from coast to coast have been bracing for ""operational challenges"" this weekend, with some even encouraging customers to rebook their plans for another weekend.
Zoom in: Philadelphia International Airport this week saw roughly 180 delayed flights and 27 cancellations on one day alone...."
"Every time there is a mass shooting in the U.S., partisans on both sides hold their collective breath waiting for the perpetrator to be identified in order to see whose worldview will be vindicated. The left gets excited about murders involving police officers shooting unarmed black people, as well as those perpetrated by white supremacists or believers in QAnon; the right highlights Muslim terrorists and Antifa. Yet the number of killings in 2020 that can be attributed to all of these causes put together is in the dozens, representing a..."
"Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson will appear on Ohio's ballot in November. The swing state is the latest to accept Mr. Johnson onto the ballot as a third-party alternative to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. But if his appearance on the Ohio ballot is a victory for Johnson, it's still a relatively small one compared with the challenges that lie ahead."
"The 17-year-old accused of murdering two people during Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, will not face gun charges in his home state of Illinois.
Kyle Rittenhouse faces two counts of two counts of first-degree intentional homicide after traveling from his home town of Antioch to join up with militia groups at the protest on August 25.
The suspect was originally accused of traveling across state with an AR-15 rifle he was not legally allowed to possess and using it to kill Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and injure..."
"Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed into law a bill that will legalize marijuana in Illinois next year, marking a momentous shift in how the state treats drug use.
The bill will allow the licensed growth, sales, possession and consumption of cannabis for adults 21 and older.
The signing ceremony, attended by several lawmakers, officeholders and marijuana supporters, took place at the Sankofa Cultural Arts & Business Center in Chicago’s Austin neighborhood.
Pritzker called the legislation a “sea change” for Illinois, saying that the war on drugs has destroyed families..."
"It was a leak clearly designed to make William Barr's day on Capitol Hill far more unpleasant.
The source or sources who showed The Washington Post a letter of complaint that Bob Mueller had written Barr created a media explosion that reverberated all day yesterday, when the attorney general had been slated to testify before a Senate committee. Even before he took the hot seat, some Democrats were calling on Barr to resign — which has virtually no chance of happening.
Once the Judiciary Committee hearing got underway, it was..."
"Hiring by U.S. employers remained robust in July, if a bit slower than previous months, with a broad-based rise in payrolls extending a half-year streak of strong employment gains.
Nonfarm employment rose by a seasonally adjusted 209,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday. Payrolls rose by 298,000 in June, revised up from an earlier estimate of 288,000, and May's gain was revised up to 229,000 from an earlier estimate of 224,000."
"Yemen's President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his Prime Minister, Khaled Baha, have resigned, officials said.
It comes amid an ongoing stand-off with Shia Houthi rebels.
Houthi gunmen have a tight grip on the capital, Sanaa, and are holding a presidential aide who was abducted last week.
There are reports that Yemen's parliament has refused to accept the president's resignation.
The Houthi leadership had previously committed to withdrawing from key positions around the presidential palace and the home of President Hadi."
"Colin Powell, the first Black U.S. secretary of state and top military officer, died on Monday at the age of 84 due to complications from COVID-19. He was fully vaccinated, his family said in a statement on Facebook.
""We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American,"" his family said, offering thanks to the staff of the hospital near Washington, D.C. who treated Powell but providing few details about his illness.
Powell was one of America's most prominent Black figures for decades. He served three Republican presidents in..."

"The House will forge ahead next week with the process that would allow Democrats to pass a coronavirus relief bill without Republican support, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday.
The California Democrat said her chamber will move to pass a budget resolution, the first step toward approving legislation through reconciliation. The process would enable Senate Democrats to approve an aid measure without GOP votes.
Pelosi said the House plans to pass a resolution and send it across the Capitol, where the Senate will also have to pass a budget measure. She..."
"Despite the prevalence of opinions that Vladimir Putin has lost his mind, nuclear weapons experts continue to see the Russian president as a rational man who isn't willing yet to risk the severe consequences of using a nuclear weapon on Ukraine.
Putin is growing increasingly isolated as the assault on Ukraine nears its third week, and the Russian leader's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert has raised fears about how far he might go. But 10 nuclear weapons experts Newsweek spoke to consider it unlikely that he would hit the nuclear..."
"More than a third of U.S. states reported record highs in average new Covid-19 cases as deaths across the U.S. gradually rise, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Across the U.S., 19 states saw new cases reach daily records on Sunday, based on an average over the previous seven days, according to the data. That includes Texas, Georgia and Florida, the last of which reported a shattering 15,300 new cases on Sunday. CNBC uses a seven-day trailing average to smooth out spikes in..."
"After weeks of lobbying the White House on how gig workers should be treated, the rideshare, delivery and retail industries are bracing for a new rule that is likely to make it easier to classify them as employees, multiple sources say. A proposed rule from the Department of Labor, aimed at defining whether gig workers for companies including Uber (UBER.N), Lyft (LYFT.O), DoorDash (DASH.N) and retailers such as Amazon.com Inc are misidentified as independent contractors, is under review at the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and is expected to be..."
"Police in Washington, D.C., say two teenage girls have been arrested on charges of felony murder and armed carjacking for their alleged role in the death of Uber Eats driver Mohammad Anwar.
According to CNN, the Metropolitan Police Department said the two girls, ages 13 and 15, used a taser on Anwar, 66, during a recent carjacking attempt on Tuesday. The attack, police said, prompted an accident that resulted in his death.
Anwar, who lived in Springfield, Va., was described by his family in a GoFundMe as a “hard-working Pakistani..."
"President Biden has told former President Obama that he is planning to run for reelection in 2024, two sources tell The Hill.  
The admission to Obama is the latest indication that Biden is likely to run for a second term, something the president has spoken about publicly.  
During a press conference in Brussels last month, he told reporters he’d be “very fortunate” to run against his rival in the 2020 election, former President Trump.   
“[Biden] wants to run and he’s clearly letting everyone know,” said one of the two sources familiar with the conversations between Obama and Biden.  
The source also..."
"A coalition of 23 Democrat-led states, counties and municipalities is suing the Trump administration for a final rule that protects health care providers who refuse to provide care on the basis of their religious beliefs.
The lawsuit, announced Tuesday, is led by New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) and seeks to have the rule declared unconstitutional, as well as a court order to prevent it from going into effect.
It is the second lawsuit against the administration’s so-called conscience protection rule. San Francisco announced a similar lawsuit earlier this..."
"Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on Monday that he plans to retire by the end of Biden’s term in office.
“By the time we get to the end of the Biden administration term, I feel it would be time for me to step down from this position,” Fauci told the Washington Post Monday.
Politico was first to report on Fauci’s plans.
“We’re in a pattern now. If somebody says, ‘You’ll leave when we don’t have COVID anymore,’ then I will be 105,” Fauci told Politico. “I think we’re going to be living with this.”..."
"The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) air policy chief is leaving amid ethics concerns.
The agency on Wednesday announced that Bill Wehrum, the head of EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, will leave the agency by the end of June.

"(Reuters) - Former Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang is joining CNN as a political commentator, the cable network said on Wednesday.
Yang, an entrepreneur who mounted a surprisingly robust White House bid despite having no political experience, ended his campaign last week on the night of the New Hampshire primary election after finishing a disappointing eighth.
Yang will appear on the network on Wednesday to offer analysis of that evening’s Democratic debate, a spokeswoman for CNN confirmed. Six of the eight remaining Democratic candidates have qualified for the debate, which..."
"Hong Kong’s Airport Authority has canceled all flights not yet checked in by Monday afternoon, the agency said, as anti-government protesters peacefully demonstrated at the airport for a fourth day.
“Other than departure flights that have completed the check- in process and the arrival flights already heading to Hong Kong, all other flights have been canceled for the rest of today,” the authority said in a statement.
Traffic on roads to the airport was very congested and car park spaces were full, the authority said.

"Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Thursday said the Senate will vote to open debate on the bipartisan infrastructure deal Wednesday, setting up a key test vote on the legislation.
""Today I'm announcing that I intend to file cloture on the vehicle for the bipartisan infrastructure bill on Monday of next week,"" Schumer said from the Senate floor.
Because the bipartisan group doesn't actually have a bill, Schumer will file cloture on a shell bill that senators will later swap the bipartisan legislation into. The bill will need 60 votes to..."
"Tonight was a mixed bag for former President Donald Trump’s endorsement record. Two of his preferred candidates lost their House races in Georgia, while his other two picks this evening prevailed: Rep. Ben Cline in Virginia’s 6th District easily cruised to renomination, and former Business Council of Alabama President Katie Britt won in the Alabama Senate primary runoff against Rep. Mo Brooks.
Overall, though, 94 percent of Trump’s endorsed candidates for Senate, House and governor have won their races — or put another way, 110 Trump-backed candidates out of 117..."
"Leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Tuesday warned Congress that while the federal government is working to help manufacture a vaccine against the new coronavirus, its development “might take some time” to come to market.
As a result, Fauci told a Senate health committee in prepared testimony, the nation’s efforts to battle the deadline virus and the COVID-19 disease it triggers should be “focused on the proven public health practices of containment and mitigation.”
In remarks to the New York Times before the hearing, Fauci warned that moving..."
"The Biden administration on Tuesday urged the public to strengthen their protections against Covid-19, noting that the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron has become the dominant strain in the country.
At a briefing Tuesday, health officials outlined their plan to combat the latest form of the coronavirus to pose a threat, emphasizing existing tools like vaccines and boosters, testing, and treatments.
“BA.5 is something we’re closely monitoring, and most importantly, we know how to manage it,” said Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator."
"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican soldiers, armed police and migration officials blocked hundreds of migrants after they crossed the border from Guatemala in a caravan into southern Mexico on Wednesday, and detained dozens of them, a witness from a migrant aid group and an official said.

"A $9 billion oil pipeline that became a symbol of the rising political clout of climate change advocates and a flash point in U.S.-Canada relations was officially canceled on Wednesday.
Keystone XL, which was proposed in 2008 to bring oil from Canada’s Western tar sands to U.S. refiners, was halted by owner TC Energy after U.S. President Joe Biden this year revoked a key permit needed for a U.S. stretch of the 1,200-mile project.
Opponents of the line fought its construction for years, saying it was unnecessary and would hamper the U.S...."
"The impact of the coronavirus-induced economic shutdown tore through the U.S. labor market in April at historic levels, slashing 20.5 million workers from nonfarm payrolls and sending the unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday.
Both numbers easily smashed post-World War II era records and help reflect the profound damage done through efforts used to combat the virus."
"Gold futures found only modest support on Friday, as traders parsed data showing a loss of more than 20 million U.S. jobs in April tied to efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but prices for the precious metal look to end the week a bit higher.

"Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) should send a letter to Fox News saying the following: Do more investigative journalism. Break more news.
That is the most logical recourse in light of her questioning of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on Wednesday in another one of those congressional super-hearings. True to both his own preference and Justice Department instructions, Mueller — at least in his testimony Wednesday morning before the House Judiciary Committee — stuck closely to the text of his two-volume report, which was released in April in redacted..."
"In a big win for President Joe Biden, Senate Democrats drove their election-year economic package to approval Sunday.
The passing Inflation Reduction Act was less than the president’s original $4 trillion proposal, but still a substantial compromise package made up of health care, climate change and deficit-reduction strategies, in hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits. 
After a marathon, 27-hour weekend session of debate, Democrats held united, 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.

Some mourners bowed their heads, others made the sign of the cross or raised a fist. Many wore face masks to..."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Monday that he is “not a fan” of the idea of adding seats to the Supreme Court after repeatedly dodging questions about the issue.
“I’m not a fan of court packing, but I don’t want to get off on that whole issue. I want to keep focused,” Biden told WKRC, a Cincinnati-area CBS/CW affiliate. “The president would like nothing better than to fight about whether or not I would in fact pack the court or not pack the court, et cetera. The focus is,..."
"It’s no secret that Twitter is Trump’s soap box du jour. In one day, Trump blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for failing to repeal and replace ObamaCare, firmly cementing the ongoing feud between the two Republicans and — perhaps most significant — highlighting the divide between two divisions of government."
"The death toll of migrants who have succumbed to the heat after being trapped in a tractor-trailer has risen to more than 50.
Discovered Monday night on a remote stretch on San Antonio’s Southwest Side, these migrants deserved a humane and fair immigration system — one that honors the rights of asylum workers, recognizes our workforce needs and reflects the inherent dignity in all people."
"At least 123 visitors to Nevada have tested positive for the coronavirus in the weeks following their trip and returning home, USA Today reports. This comes after casinos in the state reopened on June 4, with state Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) aiming to rejuvenate the economy by welcoming tourists back to Las Vegas.
In light of the rising case count, with almost 1,000 new cases added on Monday bringing the state total to 43,831 total infection, Sisolak reimposed bar closures last week in county hotspots and added capacity restrictions for..."
"President Biden on Wednesday will present his third $1 trillion+ package to Congress since taking office, asking for $1.8 trillion in new spending to expand the American education system, provide more help for childcare and create millions more jobs.

Administration officials insist that Biden’s American Families Plan — with $1 trillion in..."
"Physicians around the world have suggested the Omicron variant may cause milder illness than other forms of the coronavirus. But actually understanding Omicron’s severity is an open question, experts caution — one that requires more patient data and more time to answer.
The South African physician Angelique Coetzee told the BBC this weekend, for example, that the cases she and colleagues were seeing weren’t serious. “We haven’t admitted anyone,” she said. In Israel, one doctor told Haaretz that, “if it continues this way, this might be a relatively mild illness compared to the Delta variant.”

"The Supreme Court on Monday turned down two requests to block New York’s vaccine mandate for health care workers. Two groups of health care workers are challenging the mandate, arguing that it violates their constitutional right to freely exercise their religion. But over the public dissents of three conservative justices, the court denied the workers’ requests to put the mandate on hold while litigation continues.
The dispute centers on a regulation issued by New York’s state health department that requires all health care workers in the state to be vaccinated against COVID-19 unless..."

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide the legality of one of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies that has forced tens of thousands of migrants along the southern border to wait in Mexico, rather than entering the United States, while their asylum claims are processed.
The justices will hear a Trump administration appeal of a 2019 lower court ruling that found the policy likely violated federal immigration law. The program, called Migrant Protection Protocols, remains in effect because the Supreme Court in March put the lower court’s..."
"We are scholars of election law who span the ideological spectrum but agree on two fundamental principles to help avert potential political upheaval in the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election.
First, to avoid a repeat of Jan. 6, or worse, Congress must rewrite the Electoral Count Act, the outmoded 1887 law that governs the certification of the presidential vote. There is a pressing need for a clear set of rules to govern the certification of the presidential vote.
Second, this revision should be based on the premise that Congress..."

"THE UNITED STATES is currently undertaking its population census, the once-a-decade effort to count every single person living here. More than 150 other countries will join in this world census round—the 10-year period centered on 2020, and around 90 percent of the world’s population has already been or will be counted.

"At college dormitories and student apartments across the U.S., census forms will be piling up — but many run the risk of not being filled in.
The spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. has coincided with the start of data collection for the 2020 census.

The rapid spread of the virus has meant that most..."
"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican condemned gender theory on Monday as part of a “confused concept of freedom”, saying in a new document that the idea of gender being determined by personal feeling rather than biology was an attempt to “annihilate nature”.
LGBT rights advocates denounced the 30-page document, called “Male and Female He Created Them”, as harmful and confusing, saying it would encourage hatred and bigotry.
The document, the Vatican’s first on gender theory, was written by the Congregation for Catholic Education as an “instruction” to Catholic educators..."

No nominee to the Supreme Court has ever been confirmed by the Senate this close to a presidential election, with more than 58 million ballots already cast ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3.
The rush to confirm Barrett, 48, has bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans, who are..."
"Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share in cash, or about $43 billion, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday.
Why it matters: The move, which Musk called his ""best and final offer,"" comes after the billionaire has repeatedly criticized Twitter, disclosed a 9.2% stake in the social media company and backed out of joining its board of directors.
What they're saying: ""As I indicated this weekend, I believe that the company should be private to go through the changes that need to be made,"" Musk..."
"The House on Wednesday voted to censure Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and strip him of his committee assignments for posting a video on Twitter that depicts him attacking President Biden and killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
Why it matters: Gosar is the second House Republican to lose committee seats at the hands of the Democratic majority in the 117th Congress, which has been plagued by violence and inflammatory rhetoric both inside and outside the Capitol.
The censure resolution, which passed 223-210, got little cross-party support.
Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) voted with..."
"The hotly contested Georgia Senate race will head to a runoff between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican former NFL player Herschel Walker, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said.
Neither candidate will garner the 50% of the vote needed to clinch the seat outright under state rules. The two Senate hopefuls will head to a Dec. 6 runoff.
“Right now we have less than 20,000 total votes still out to be counted. That’s not enough to change the race. So this is headed for a runoff,” Raffensperger said Wednesday morning on..."
"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took aim at legislation recently introduced in Alabama by a state representative that would, if passed, make it mandatory for certain men to get vasectomies — a bill that comes in response to legislation passed last year that seeks to ban abortion in the state.
“Yikes,” Cruz wrote in response to the bill on Twitter on Sunday morning. “A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything...literally!”"
"A gunman who livestreamed himself driving around Memphis shooting at people, killing four and wounding three others in seemingly random attacks, was finally arrested after crashing a stolen car, police said early Thursday.
The hours-long rampage had police warning people across the city to shelter in place, locking down a baseball stadium and university campuses and suspending public bus services as frightened residents wondered where the man might strike next.
Ezekiel Kelly, 19, is believed to be connected to multiple shootings that were livestreamed on social media, according to Memphis police...."
"MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace on Friday showed an altered video clip of herself to blast President Trump’s attempt to ""smear"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) with an edited video.
The “Deadline: White House” host said on her show that the clash between Trump and Pelosi this week has “deteriorated to a level beneath words — comprehensible words at least.”
“That’s why we’re going to do something different here to make sure you understand just how low the president has stooped in his efforts to smear the Speaker of the House,”..."
"Senior administration officials told The New York Times on Wednesday that the U.S has provided intelligence to Ukraine’s armed forces and that it has been used to help kill Russian generals who have died during the country’s ongoing war.
While not specifying how many Russian generals have been killed thanks to U.S. assistances, sources told the Times the information was part of a classified program that aims to help Ukrainians provide real-time intel. Ukraine maintains that it has killed 12 Russian generals.
The Times reported that Ukrainian officials have combined..."
"Ukraine and Russia have signed two separate UN-backed deals with Turkey to allow the export of millions of tonnes of grain from Ukraine's Black Sea ports blockaded by Russia. 
The agreements envision the use of three Ukrainian ports - Odesa, Chornomorsk, and Yuzhne - to export grain under the supervision of Ukraine, the UN, and Turkey. The agreement doesn't envision a Russian presence in these ports, nor those it allows Russia to escort Ukrainian grain out of the country.
The agreement doesn't mention lifting Russian sanctions, something the Kremlin has asked for..."
"With the impeachment trial in the rearview mirror, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for the creation of a congressional commission to investigate the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, though Democrats are still more focused on former President Donald Trump’s role in inciting the mob than Republicans.
On Sunday, one day after Trump was acquitted despite 57 senators voting “guilty,” Republicans and Democrats expressed approval for a commission similar to the one that probed the September 11th terrorist attacks.
“Of course” we need a..."
"Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says.
It blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email.
The services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday.
But the company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"".
Sheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix..."
"Parts of the Southeastern U.S. are seeing gasoline shortages following a cyberattack that shut down Colonial Pipeline.
As of Tuesday afternoon, nearly 8 percent of Virginia gas stations, more than 6 percent of North Carolina gas stations and more than 4 percent of Georgia gas stations were without fuel, according to Gasbuddy analyst Patrick De Haan.
Other states, like Florida and South Carolina, also saw some outages.
In an interview with The Hill on Monday, De Haan predicted that parts of the Southeast were likely to be at..."
"Facebook has declared — again — that its Trending Topics section is free of any political bias or manipulation. However, the company says it is still changing the way it finds articles for the news section.
First, the declaration: Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch wrote in a blog post that the company met with Sen. John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, last week to discuss its trending news section, which came under fire after Gizmodo reported that Facebook employees were quashing conservative news stories from appearing on the..."
"Immigrants seeking asylum in the United States from Mexico must now also first seek protection from a so-called third party country, the Trump administration said on Monday.
The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, in a joint statement, said the new interim rule would set a “new bar” for immigrants trying to enter across the southern U.S. border “by placing further restrictions or limitations on eligibility for aliens who seek asylum in the United States.”"
"President Trump threatened again Friday to shut down all or a portion of the U.S. southern border as administration officials said that the influx of illegal immigrants there was straining resources beyond the breaking point.
While touring Florida’s Lake Okeechobee Friday, Mr. Trump called on Mexico to stop asylum-seeking families from reaching the U.S. border. “We will keep the border closed,” he said. “And we will keep it stopped for a long time. I’m not playing games.”"
"Ukraine says hundreds of graves have been found outside Izyum, days after it was re-taken from Russia.
Wooden crosses, most of them marked with numbers, were discovered in a forest outside the city by advancing Ukrainian forces.
Authorities said they would start exhuming some of the graves on Friday.
It is not yet clear what happened to the victims, but early accounts suggest some may have died from shelling and a lack of access to healthcare.
Speaking on Friday, the head of Ukraine's national police service said most of the..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine has brought the world closer to ""Armageddon"" than at any time since the Cold-War Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. President Joe Biden said.
Putin celebrated his 70th birthday to fawning praise from some officials. But with his seven-month invasion unravelling, public events appeared sparse, a contrast to just a week ago, when he staged a huge concert on Red Square to proclaim the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukrainian land.
In a clear repudiation of Putin's record, the Nobel Peace..."
"There are less than two months left before the midterm elections.
Lately, Democrats have become more hopeful and Republicans more nervous as the polling lead the GOP enjoyed earlier in the year has eroded.
The battle for the Senate looks, for now, to be balanced on a knife-edge, even as the GOP remains favored to take over the House.
Candidates and local issues will clearly be vital in many races. But this is a national election too.
Here are the five biggest issues that will determine the outcome."
"WASHINGTON—The Senate unanimously passed Thursday a bill prohibiting federal employees from using TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video-sharing app, on government-issued devices as U.S. national-security concerns mount.
The measure passed through an expedited procedure that avoided a roll-call vote. The White House has been pushing for a sale of TikTok to U.S. owners, citing national-security risks amid fears that the Chinese government could exploit the personal data of users.
“In light of all we know, it is unthinkable to me that we should continue to permit federal employees, those workers entrusted..."
"NIAID director Anthony Fauci told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that health officials are considering revising masking guidelines for vaccinated Americans.
Why it matters: Fauci said that the United States is ""going in the wrong direction"" as cases surge across the country, driven by the more contagious Delta variant.
""If you look at the inflection of the curve of new cases and, as you said in the run-in to this interview, it is among the unvaccinated. And since we have 50% of the country that not fully vaccinated, that's a problem,"" Fauci said.
The big picture: Fauci confirmed that new..."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence has endorsed Republican candidate Karrin Taylor Robson in the race for Arizona governor, declaring her ""the best choice for Arizona's future.""
Taylor Robson's campaign also confirmed Pence would visit the Grand Canyon State on Friday, holding events for her in Phoenix and southern Arizona.
The same day, Pence's old boss, former President Donald Trump, is set to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, bringing the civil war within the Republican party to the battleground state with the primary election little more than a week away.
Pence's support..."
"The New York Attorney General's Office has allegedly uncovered $1 billion in wire transfers by the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, which could suggest attempts to hide its wealth as it faces litigation over its role in the opioid crisis.
The transfers include some done through Swiss bank accounts, The New York Times reported.
State Attorney General Letitia James (D) reportedly issued subpoenas last month to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers in an attempt to fully discover the family's wealth.
""While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims..."
"Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos renewed his spat with the White House over the weekend, as the world's third-richest person criticized President Joe Biden for calling on companies running gasoline stations to lower their prices.
In a tweet on Saturday, Biden said, ""this is a time of war and global peril,"" and demanded the companies lower gasoline prices, which have soared to about $5 a gallon in many parts of the country.
""Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you're paying for the product...."
"Liberals in the House on Monday rallied behind the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that the Democratic-controlled Congress is set to send to President Biden’s desk this week, despite some frustration over changes made by the Senate to appease key centrists.
House progressives signaled that they will still back the legislation following amendments adopted by the Senate to restrict income eligibility for stimulus checks and keep weekly unemployment insurance payments at $300, while ensuring that the first $10,200 of jobless benefits aren’t subject to taxes.
Another key progressive provision..."
"As we approach RepresentUs’ 10-year anniversary in 2022, I want to celebrate all the work we’ve done and the continued momentum of our anti-corruption movement while also recognizing the severe threats to democracy ahead.
I co-founded RepresentUs — the nation’s largest grassroots anti-corruption organization — in 2012 to fill a glaring gap in the democracy advocacy space. Too many nonprofit groups were directing their efforts solely toward the 25 percent or so of the country who identified as liberal, despite the fact that majorities of Americans of all political stripes support..."
"Former President Trump on Saturday hailed the Arizona state Senate for its ongoing audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County during a rally in Phoenix, while taking shots at Gov. Doug Ducey (R).
Speaking to a crowd of supporters at the event dubbed the “Rally for Election Integrity,” Trump began by thanking the “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona State Senate” for forging ahead with the audit.
The former president recognized the appearance of several GOP state senators, particularly thanking Arizona Senate President Karen Fann (R), who has overseen the effort that..."
"Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant overnight, local officials said on Sunday, adding to residents' anguish as reports of shelling around the plant fuelled fears of a radiation disaster.
Russia's defence ministry said there was more Ukrainian shelling of the plant over the past 24 hours, just a day after Moscow and Kyiv traded accusations of targeting Europe's biggest nuclear plant, which has prompted grave international concern.
Ukrainian nuclear company Energoatom said it had no new information about attacks on the..."
"President Trump signed an executive order prohibiting Americans from investing in a group of Chinese companies the U.S. says supply and otherwise support China’s military, intelligence and security services.
The order blocks American companies and individuals from owning shares directly or through funds that include any of 31 companies identified by the U.S. as aiding the modernization of the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, and China’s intelligence and security services.
Those firms, which include large state-run aerospace, shipbuilding and construction companies as well as technology companies such as the video-surveillance-equipment..."
"Russia has rejected appeals for a complete demilitarisation of the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine.
The move would make the plant more vulnerable, a Russian official said.
The calls come amid growing concern over safety at the site - Europe's largest nuclear plant - as both sides accuse each other of shelling the area.
Ukrainian workers operate the plant, which has been under Russian control since March.
It was one of the first sites seized by Russian troops following the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February...."
"The idea of “quiet quitting” has taken social media by storm, as young workers on TikTok and other platforms argue that employees should only do what is required in their job description, and no more.
But a recent survey from Gallup suggests that the practice of quiet quitting is not just a social media fad. The survey firm found that around 50% of U.S. workers were “not engaged,” meaning they felt detached from work and were doing the bare minimum, similar to the idea of “quiet quitting.” Gallup interviewed more than 15,000..."
"Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli on Monday defended a controversial Trump administration rule that would link an immigrant's ability to secure green cards to their use of certain public programs.
Cuccinelli told reporters at the White House that the ""public charge"" change promotes “the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.”
""We certainly expect people of any income to be able to stand on their own two feet. If people are not able to be self-sufficient, then this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against..."
"President Biden said the U.S. is on pace to leave Afghanistan by Aug. 31, warning of growing security risks and describing a tenuous situation on the ground, as the Taliban said they would prevent Afghan citizens from reaching Kabul’s airport to board evacuation flights.
“The sooner we can finish, the better. Each day of operations brings added risk to our troops,” Mr. Biden said at the White House on Tuesday.
The president said he had instructed the Pentagon and the State Department to develop contingency plans in the event the timeline for..."
"President Donald Trump’s expected nomination of former pizza chain executive Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve appeared in jeopardy on Thursday after a fourth Republican senator voiced opposition, possibly denying Cain the support needed to be confirmed in the post.
“If I had to vote today, I would vote no,” Senator Kevin Cramer said in a statement.
If all of the Senate’s Democrats and the two independents aligned with them were to vote against Cain, he would fall short of the majority support he needs.
ABC News, citing sources familiar..."
"The U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs in June, according to data released Thursday by the Labor Department, as the gradual easing of coronavirus-related restrictions helped more businesses reopen and bring back workers.
The unemployment rate also fell to 11.1 percent last month, according to the report, as more workers who were laid off earlier this year were able to return to their pre-pandemic jobs.
Economists expected the U.S. to add anywhere between 1 and 3 million jobs for the month after the U.S. added 2.7 million in May, according..."
"A Russian court has extended the detention of US basketball star Brittney Griner for another two months, reports state news agency Tass.
The 31-year-old has been held in Moscow since February when customs officials allegedly found cannabis oil in her luggage.
It carries a maximum 10-year jail sentence.
Hillary Clinton had called for her release, after re-tweeting a BBC article about the player's predicament.
But the Moscow court announced on Thursday it was keeping her in custody.
""The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of..."
"The Supreme Court dealt a blow to President Obama on Thursday, deadlocking over the legality of the president's controversial immigration programs.
In a one-sentence decision, the court affirmed a lower court's ruling that blocks the programs from going forward. The ruling effectively kills the initiatives for the remainder of Obama’s presidency.
   "
"House Democratic leaders on Tuesday unveiled a set of changes to a $4.5 billion package to address the flow of migrants at the southern border in an effort to win over skeptical progressive and Hispanic lawmakers.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democratic leaders met with members of the Progressive and Hispanic caucuses late into the night on Monday to win over their support to pass the legislation, which the House is expected to consider on Tuesday.
The changes unveiled by the House Appropriations Committee include requiring Customs and Border Protection..."
"A candidate endorsed by Donald Trump has won the Republican Senate nomination for Ohio, in a sign of the former US president's continued influence on his party.
Author and venture capitalist JD Vance beat six other candidates in a race that set a record for the most money, $66m (£52m), ever spent on an Ohio election.
He trailed his more established political opponents for much of the primary campaign but saw a late surge following Mr Trump's endorsement.
Mr Vance is best known for authoring the 2016 book Hillbilly Elegy,..."
"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that President Biden's 2024 plans have not changed — he will run for re-election.
Why it matters: Biden has said that he intends to run in two years with Vice President Harris as his running mate if he remains in good health and if his predecessor campaigns again, but it hasn't quelled public scrutiny of his chances of winning again.
Many, including a chief strategist for former President Obama’s two presidential campaigns, have pointed out that Biden's age could become a liability.
Others, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have declined..."
"The White House is attacking multiple GOP lawmakers for hypocrisy after they complained about President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program despite having large loans of their own forgiven by the government.
Biden announced a plan on Wednesday to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt to individual borrowers, prompting a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, many of whom argued that the debt relief was ""unfair"" because it would not apply to those who never went to college or had already paid off their loans.
The official White House Twitter account on Thursday hit..."
"Joe Biden has become the first US president to issue a statement formally describing the 1915 massacre of Armenians as a genocide.
The killings took place in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire, the forerunner of modern-day Turkey.
But the issue is highly sensitive, with Turkey acknowledging atrocities but rejecting the term ""genocide"".
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday that Turkey ""entirely rejects"" the US decision.
""We will not take lessons from anyone on our history,"" he tweeted.
Later the Turkish foreign ministry said it had summoned the..."
"As states worked to tally remaining ballots two days after Election Day, Democratic nominee Joe Biden sat just shy Thursday of the electoral votes needed to win the White House.
Votes counted in undecided states so far show the paths both he and President Donald Trump have to the 270 electoral vote threshold that would earn them the presidency.
As of Thursday morning Biden had won 253 electoral votes, according to NBC News projections. Trump trailed with 214.
The race appeared to come down to a handful of states NBC..."
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden may not need to secure the vote in Pennsylvania, a tipping point state offering 20 electoral votes that is likely to make or break the election, to get the 270 electoral votes required to win the race.
The most ""plausible path"" for Biden is ""Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan... then he wouldn't have to have Pennsylvania,"" GOP pollster Daron Shaw told the Fox News Decision Desk on Wednesday.
At time of writing, according to The Associated Press' election data, Joe Biden has 238 Electoral College votes to..."
"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange must not be extradited to the U.S., where he's wanted on charges of violating the Espionage Act and hacking government computers, because of the high risk of suicide in U.S. custody, a British judge in London ruled Monday.
Why it matters: The ruling, which will be appealed by the U.S., is a huge win for Assange after a years-long battle. The case has raised significant questions about First Amendment protections for publishers of classified information, as Assange argues he was acting as a journalist when he..."
"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on Monday said the Senate should reinstate the 60-vote threshold for all judicial and executive branch nominees.  
Sinema made the comments during a Q&A session following a speech at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) introduced the Arizona moderate at the event. 
“Not only am I committed to the 60-vote threshold, I have an incredibly unpopular view. I actually think we should restore the 60-vote threshold for the areas in which it has been eliminated already. We should restore it,” Sinema..."
"While there is no official legal definition of “sanctuary city,” the term generally refers to towns, cities, or counties that decline to cooperate completely with federal detention requests related to undocumented immigrants, often with a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. 
Some argue that sanctuary cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Chicago should not receive federal funding because they are not enforcing federal immigration laws. Others say that sanctuary city policies protect both citizens and undocumented immigrants.
There are 11 states, 40 cites, and 143 counties listed as sanctuary jurisdictions..."
"The Department of Justice on Thursday filed a motion to appeal a federal judge's ruling to allow a special master to review evidence seized from former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence last month.
State of play: The notice of appeal comes three days after Judge Aileen Cannon ruled on Monday that a special master should be appointed ""to review the seized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege,"" per the filing.
Cannon also said that the order ""temporarily enjoins the..."
"The Senate is set to vote this week on a bill to codify the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage protections after a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a deal earlier Monday, signaling they believe they have the votes to get past a filibuster and move the measure to President Biden’s desk.
Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) filed cloture on the legislation on Monday, teeing up the first vote on the measure for Wednesday. "
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) challenged Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to a debate amid the latter's decision to send nearly 50 Venezuelan migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, a wealthy enclave outside of Boston.
The big picture: It's the latest in a clash between Republican politicians, who oppose President Biden's immigration and border policies, and Democrats, who have slammed tactics to transport migrants as a political ploy.
Republicans are particularly taking aim at sanctuary cities and sending migrants there to test their values and force them to grapple with social safety-net issues,..."
"Nonfarm payrolls rose solidly in August amid an otherwise slowing economy, while the unemployment rate ticked higher as more workers rejoined the labor force, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
The economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just below the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations largely due to a rising labor force participation rate. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons rose to 7%..."
"Anthony Fauci and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) got into a heated debate at a Senate health committee hearing on Tuesday, clashing over whether funding from the National Institutes of Health was used for risky ""gain-of-function"" research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
Why it matters: Questions remain about the origins of the coronavirus and the so-called ""lab leak hypothesis"" — the theory that the virus resulted from experiments in the Wuhan lab that accidentally spilled over, which the head of the World Health Organization has said should be investigated further...."
"Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines – and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive – than at any point in the last two decades. These trends manifest themselves in myriad ways, both in politics and in everyday life. And a new survey of 10,000 adults nationwide finds that these divisions are greatest among those who are the most engaged and active in the political process."
"Central Intelligence Agency officers improperly accessed computers used by a Senate committee investigating the agency's interrogation program, an internal agency report has concluded.
The finding bolsters allegations by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, who in a speech on the Senate floor in March denounced what she said was a CIA search of Senate computers that may have..."
"Ex-White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson on Tuesday testified that former President Trump and his former chief of staff Mark Meadows were both told attendees at a Jan. 6, 2021, rally had weapons, and that Trump was frustrated that those with weapons were turned away. 
Hutchinson, a former top aide to Meadows, told the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riots that Trump was “furious” that the Ellipse near the White House had not filled up to capacity for a rally on the morning of the Electoral College certification. "
"President Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. would restrict travel from Europe for the next 30 days and use executive orders to offer financial relief to individuals and small businesses in his most extensive steps to date to address the crisis of the coronavirus.
Trump said the extraordinary restrictions would not apply to Great Britain, which formally left the European Union at the end of January. Ireland is also exempt from the restrictions, according to a proclamation later issued by the White House.
Trump, in just his second Oval Office..."
"The Supreme Court said it would rule on the Obama administration’s stalled plan to defer deportation of more than four million illegal immigrants, setting the stage for a blockbuster ruling on presidential powers in June.
With Congress deadlocked over an immigration overhaul, President Barack Obama in November 2014 cited his executive authority in making changes i"
"New Hampshire state Senate President Chuck Morse (R), an establishment favorite, early Wednesday conceded defeat to retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc, who has espoused former President Trump’s false 2020 election claims, in the state’s Republican primary to face incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) in November.
The Associated Press has not yet called the race for Bolduc, but he leads Morse by 1 percentage point with more than 80 percent of the vote reported. 
Morse tweeted early in the morning that he called Bolduc to congratulate him and said that the focus needs to..."
"French President Emmanuel Macron was re-elected Sunday, according to projections based on early ballot counts, overcoming deep divisions among voters worried about inflation and the impact of immigration on France’s national identity.
Mr. Macron garnered 58.2% of the estimated vote Sunday, while far-right leader Marine Le Pen won 41.8%, according to a projection from polling firm Ipsos.
Mr. Macron, 44 years old, becomes the first French president to secure a second term in office since 2002, when then-President Jacques Chirac beat Ms. Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in a 64-point landslide...."
"The Department of Justice is planning to coordinate its ransomware attack investigations with similar protocols it uses for terrorism cases, according to internal guidance sent to U.S. attorney’s offices reviewed by Reuters.
Why it matters: The new guidance comes in the wake of at least two significant ransomware attacks against major U.S. businesses in roughly a month and as the Biden administration attempts to devise ways to thwart future attacks.
Context: In May, a criminal group breached the Colonial Pipeline, the largest refined products pipeline network in the country.
The attack forced the..."

"The second year of health plan sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act kicked off Saturday in a test of health insurance marketplaces that were hobbled by technology problems last year.
The federal site, HealthCare.gov, opened in the early hours of Saturday with a streamlined consumer application that, based on a small batch of early sign-ups, appeared to be avoiding the logjams of the first enrollment season. Most states operating their own exchanges also opened Saturday after rushing last week to finalize fixes and testing. Some showed isolated snags.
A successful..."
"A predictable chorus of critics has risen to excoriate Justice Clarence Thomas for — in the chorus’s view — hypocritically excluding a case that established a constitutional right to interracial marriage from a list of constitutional rights Thomas believes should be overturned along with Roe v. Wade (1973).  A very brief sampling of the criticism is included below; the alleged hypocrisy cited by the critics is that Thomas, who is Black, is married to a white woman.  Therefore, according to the critics, Thomas is refusing to jettison a constitutional right he enjoys while simultaneously trouncing the rights enjoyed by others."
"The prospect of an effective new Alzheimer's treatment came roaring back this week with the announcement of preliminary clinical trial data, giving millions of seniors renewed hope after a tumultuous year.
Why it matters: Alzheimer's is a devastating disease, and the topline results boosted analysts' expectations for an entire class of drugs targeting the condition. But they also resurrect enormous questions about who'll cover the costs and how the U.S. will oversee what's likely a multi-billion dollar market.
Driving the news: The success of Eisai and Biogen's clinical trial of..."
"Israel launched more airstrikes on Gaza early Tuesday, hitting the high-rise home of a Hamas field commander. Militants fired more than 250 missiles at Israel, killing two women, the first Israeli casualties in the current violence.
At least 28 Palestinians, including nine children, have been reported killed in Gaza.
With the Israeli deaths, along with 10 injuries, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said officials have decided to ""increase both the strength and rate of the strikes"" on the Gaza Strip against the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
""Hamas will receive..."
"A Minneapolis Public Schools' contract with a teachers union says that white teachers will be laid off or reassigned outside of seniority order before “educators of color” if Minneapolis Public Schools needs to reduce staff.
The clause was part of the deal struck by the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and MPS on March 25 to end a 14-day teacher strike affecting 29,000 students.
Alpha News reported the story and a partial screenshot of a contract.
“Past discrimination by the District disproportionately impacted the hiring of underrepresented teachers in the District, as compared to the..."
"US President Donald Trump is facing a longshot challenge from within his own party ahead of next year's White House election.
Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has become the first Republican to challenge Mr Trump in 2020.
Mr Weld, 73, has released a campaign video contrasting his style with the current president's.
But he faces an uphill battle to take over a Republican party that has been refashioned in Mr Trump's image.
Mr Weld was governor of Massachusetts from 1991-97 after serving in the justice department under President Ronald Reagan...."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that it is ""not the job"" of the Republican National Committee to single out Republican members who disagree with the party.
Driving the news: ""The issue is whether or not the RNC should be singling out members of our party who may have different views from the majority. That's not the job of the RNC,"" McConnell said in response to the committee's censure of Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.).

"China’s central bank renewed its tough talk on bitcoin Friday, calling all digital currency activities illegal and vowing to crack down on the market.
In a Q&A posted to its website, the People’s Bank of China said services offering trading, order matching, token issuance and derivatives for virtual currencies are strictly prohibited. Overseas crypto exchanges providing services in mainland China are also illegal, the PBOC said.
“Overseas virtual currency exchanges that use the internet to offer services to domestic residents is also considered illegal financial activity,” the central bank said, according to..."
"Kayla Jean Mueller, the last American hostage known to be held by Islamic State extremists, was confirmed dead by her relatives and the White House on Tuesday.
Ms. Mueller’s parents said they received confirmation of her death, but they didn’t provide further details of the circumstances. The Islamic State extremist group said she was killed in a Jordanian airstrike in Syria, but U.S. and Jordanian officials have been skeptical of the claim. Last Friday, her family said they believed she could still be alive and had asked her captors to..."
"The Pentagon on Tuesday clarified that U.S. troops in Poland were ""liaising"" with Ukrainian forces as they hand over weapons to them, but were not training ""in the classic sense"" following remarks from President Joe Biden on the matter.
On Monday, Biden told reporters that while in Poland last week, he had been talking to U.S. troops who were helping ""train"" Ukrainian forces in Poland.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that U.S. troops in Poland were ""liaising"" with Ukrainian forces when weapons are handed over to the forces fighting..."
"A government watchdog group filed a lawsuit against President Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the White House on Tuesday to prevent them from destroying records during his remaining time in office.
Why it matters: The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and other groups allege in their suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, that Trump and his administration are violating the Presidential Records Act by failing to properly preserve records of official government business.
Driving the news: The groups are calling..."
"A government watchdog group is suing President Trump, his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and the White House to prevent the deletion of official emails and WhatsApp messages before they can be archived.
The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), among other plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit accuses the president and the White House of violating the Presidential Records Act (PRA) by not correctly preserving records of official government business."
"Last week 3.2 million workers filed unemployment claims, easing from the peak since the coronavirus triggered U.S. shutdowns but marking the seventh week of record applications.
Nearly 33.5 million applications for unemployment benefits have been filed since mid-March, according to the Labor Department, in the seven weeks since authorities widely began ordering businesses to close to combat the spread of the virus. Prior to March, fewer than 700,000 claims were filed weekly in records back to 1967.
Applications filed for the week ended May 2, were the fewest since the..."
" Americans have become less content in recent years with the quality of the nation's K-12 education. The 42% who say they are satisfied today is the lowest measured in the past two decades by one percentage point and the second-lowest reading in Gallup's 23-year trend. Americans' satisfaction with schools was at a near-record high of 51% in 2019 before dropping slightly each year since.
At the same time, parents of children attending kindergarten through grade 12 remain largely content with their oldest child's education. The 80% who are completely or..."
"A jury on Friday found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all five counts in the 2020 fatal shooting of two men in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Driving the news: Defense lawyers argued Rittenhouse acted in self-defense when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and injured Gaige Grosskreutz, in Kenosha in August 2020.
The charges included:
First-degree intentional homicide
First-degree reckless homicide
Attempted first-degree intentional homicide
Two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety
Rittenhouse initially faced six counts, but the presiding judge dismissed the possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor charge ahead..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin said Friday that he will vote for Ketanji Brown Jackson to become the next Supreme Court justice, all but ensuring she will become the first Black woman to sit on the top U.S. court.
“After meeting with her, considering her record, and closely monitoring her testimony and questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, I have determined I intend to vote for her nomination to serve on the Supreme Court,” the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement."
"Tariffs are wrong. The US should continue its role as security guarantor of the free world. Truth is objective and not relative or “constructed”.
That is a far from exhaustive list of the epiphanies that some progressives waited until the Donald Trump years to have. The former US president’s underrated gift to politics was, at least on some issues, a better, harder-headed left.
Saudi Arabia wasn’t one of them. Here, the itch to oppose Trump, who courted the kingdom, boxed the left into a position of impractical righteousness. Joe Biden..."
"President Biden on Friday warned that “democratic progress is under assault” in the United States and Europe as he pledged support for the transatlantic alliance and called on countries to work together to address shared challenges.
“We’re at an inflection point between those who argue that, given all of the challenges we face, from the fourth industrial revolution to a global pandemic, that autocracy is the best way forward, they argue, and those who understand that democracy is essential, essential to meeting those challenges,” Biden said in remarks from the..."
"President Trump was welcomed into Madison Square Garden on Saturday night with heavy booing from the crowd.
Trump, who was also met with some cheers, was at the arena to watch the main fight of UFC 244.
It was the second time in six days the president has been heavily booed during a public appearance.
Last Sunday, Trump was in attendance for Game 5 of the World Series in Washington. When he was recognized on the scoreboard, he was met with loud rejection."
"President Donald Trump received heavy booing on Saturday night as he attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event in New York City.
Though some cheered upon the president's arrival into Madison Square Garden for UFC 244—who entered alongside his two sons, some high-ranking Republicans, UFC President Dana White and a handful of Secret Service agents—boos dominated from the sell-out crowd, according to videos shared on social media.
A small anti-Trump protest was also staged outside the arena—New York's most storied venue that lies in the heart of the city that..."
"Wind farms and massive arrays of solar panels are cropping up across public and private landscapes both in the United States and abroad as users increasingly turn to “green energy” as their preferred flavor of electricity.
President Joe Biden, in fact, has directed the Interior Department to identify suitable places to host 20 gigawatts of new energy from sun, wind or geothermal resources by 2024 as part of a sweeping effort to move away from a carbon-based economy and electrical grid.
But how green is green?
Although countries are feverishly..."
"As President Biden continues to roll out executive orders prioritizing climate change, it is increasingly clear that there will be a relatively rapid U.S. shift toward renewable energy from the sun, wind and other sources.
Indeed, many states are already pushing ahead with ambitious renewable and clean energy policies. These policies will reduce air pollution, spur extensive economic development in rural areas and make progress on the climate front.
This “revolution,” as Biden calls it, is critical. But the bulk of renewables that have been built in the..."
"Forty-five Senate Republicans backed a failed effort on Tuesday to halt former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, in a show of party unity that some cited as a clear sign he will not be convicted of inciting insurrection at the Capitol.
Republican Senator Rand Paul made a motion on the Senate floor that would have required the chamber to vote on whether Trump’s trial in February violates the U.S. Constitution.
The Democratic-led Senate blocked the motion in a 55-45 vote. But only five Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to reject the..."
"When Border Patrol radios crackled with a request for aid from local Uvalde police on Tuesday, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Agents often act as first responders to emergencies in their communities. The alert on Tuesday, however, was horrific: a gunman had entered Robb Elementary School.
Customs and Border Protection agents were among the first to respond to the mass shooting, in which at least nineteen children and two teachers were killed. That response speaks to the outsized role CBP has in small towns near the border, like..."
"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced legislation on Thursday to end no-knock warrants, a measure that has bipartisan backing as lawmakers debate broader police reforms.
Paul's legislation, titled the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act, would prohibit federal law enforcement from carrying out a warrant ""until after the officer provides notice of his or her authority and purpose.""
It would also apply to state and local law enforcement that receive funding from the Justice Department.
“After talking with Breonna Taylor’s family, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s long past time to..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump at this point is opting not to issue a pardon for himself as he prepares an expansive list of more than 100 pardons and commutations for release on Tuesday, a source familiar with the effort said.
White House advisers have said Trump has privately debated with advisers whether to take the extraordinary step of issuing a pardon for himself but some administration officials have cautioned Trump against a self-pardon because it would make him look guilty.
Many scholars have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because..."
"A federal judge in Alaska has reinstated a ban on oil-and-gas drilling in vast swaths of the Arctic Ocean, potentially undermining a central part of the Trump administration’s effort to expand offshore drilling.
Mr. Trump will need congressional authority, according to the ruling, to reopen drilling in Arctic areas and smaller parts of the Atlantic Ocean that the Obama administration put off limits just weeks before President Obama left office."
"Not so long ago, you could start a real family Fourth of July squabble by debating what should go into coleslaw or what makes a proper barbecue. But now our divisions are far more serious. Majorities of both parties feel tone and civility are getting worse. More Americans are hostile toward their opposing party than ever in history. And few even want to see their children marry someone of the opposite party."
"Sanjay Gupta, CNN's top medical analyst, told Joe Rogan the network should not have referred to medication he took to combat a coronavirus infection as ""horse dewormer"" during its coverage of the popular podcaster's bout with the disease. 
""It's a lie on a news network ... that's a lie that they're conscious of. It's not a mistake,"" Rogan said to Gupta as the longtime medical analyst appeared on his show this week. ""They're unfavorably framing it as veterinary medicine."" 
The controversial podcaster, who has drawn criticism for past statements about coronavirus immunity..."
"The House on Wednesday passed a bill to establish a commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, earning relatively little support from Republicans as GOP leaders sought to quash a bill negotiated by one of their own members.
Lawmakers passed the bill in a 252-175 vote, with 35 Republicans joining all Democrats in support.
The legislation’s chances appear increasingly slim in the Senate after both Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) came out in opposition to the bill."
"Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) asked the D.C. National Guard to activate and help manage an influx of migrants to the capital.
The mayor’s office reports that Texas Govs. Greg Abbott  (R) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) have sent nearly 200 buses carrying more than 4,000 migrants from the southern border to the capital in protest of President Biden’s immigration policy."
"Legal experts quickly shed doubt on the value and credibility of right-wing strategist Steve Bannon agreeing to testify before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack against the U.S. Capitol.
News first broke Sunday that Trump in a Saturday letter waved executive privilege he had claimed over Bannon's testimony. The former Trump administration official's attorney also sent a letter to the committee saying that his client is ""willing to, and indeed prefers, to testify at your public hearing.""
The news was seen as a significant reversal, as Bannon has been..."
"Nemo resideo is a Latin phrase that means, “Leave no one behind.” It is such a fundamental American value that this commitment is embedded in the creed of several branches of the U.S. military. Yet some American citizens are being left behind now that the last plane has left Kabul on Monday. “We believe there are still a small number of Americans—under 200 and likely closer to 100–who remain in Afghanistan, and want to leave,” Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Monday. This contradicts Joe Biden’s previous comments. During an August 18 interview with..."
"Five days into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, false or misleading videos and images about the invasion continue to go viral.
Among the things spreading quickly are old videos being depicted as current - along with claims that pictures such as the one above are old, even when they verifiably come from the present conflict.
We've been looking into some of the most viral claims.
Claims have circulated online that images and clips from the destruction of a residential building in Chuhuiv, in eastern Ukraine, on Thursday are instead from..."
"The conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court has chipped away at the wall separating church and state in a series of new rulings, eroding American legal traditions intended to prevent government officials from promoting any particular faith.
In three decisions in the past eight weeks, the court has ruled against government officials whose policies and actions were taken to avoid violating the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment prohibition on governmental endorsement of religion - known as the “establishment clause.”
The court on Monday backed a Washington state public high school football coach who..."
"For evidence that crime will likely be a key issue for California voters in next year’s election, look no further than this weekend.
On Sunday, a pack of looters robbed a jewelry store in a Hayward mall, smashing glass cases and absconding with the valuables into waiting cars. Also Sunday, Walnut Creek police recommended that businesses close early, citing intelligence that the 80 thieves who ransacked a Nordstrom on Saturday night could strike again. Officials labeled the Nordstrom robbery as “organized retail theft” and said it was possibly linked to a series of burglaries..."
"Apple Inc. AAPL 0.45% said it is keeping production of its new Mac Pro in Texas, reversing earlier plans to shift assembly of the computer to China.
The decision follows the Trump administration’s move last week to grant tariff exemptions on 10 items Apple imports from China. The exclusions for components, including a power supply and a logic board, cover a period from September of last year to August 2020, and the U.S. will refund tariffs already paid.
The tech giant had earlier tapped Taiwanese contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to..."
"Fencing around the Capitol installed ahead of the “Justice for J6” rally on Saturday started coming down on Sunday afternoon, according to footage shared by several reporters on Twitter.
""And just as fast as it went up, the fence erected around the Capitol for the 'Justice for J6' rally is now coming back down,"" tweeted Associated Press reporter Mike Balsamo along with a video of construction workers hauling away sections of fence. 
NBC News producer Frank Thorp posted a video showing several men in neon gear dismantling the fencing using power tools. 
“And..."
"Joe Biden scored decisive primary victories in Michigan and three other U.S. states on Tuesday, taking a big step toward the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination and casting doubt on the future of rival Bernie Sanders’ fading White House bid.
The sweeping wins put Biden, 77, on a path to face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, and the former vice president quickly began to look ahead, calling for party unity and making an appeal to supporters of Sanders.
“We share a common goal, and together we are going..."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has turned down President Joe Biden's request for a new scaled-down pandemic-related moratorium on residential evictions, citing a lack of legal authority to take the action, the White House said on Monday.
The previous moratorium, which protected millions of Americans behind on their rent from being tossed out of houses and apartments, expired at midnight on Saturday, with Congress failing to renew it as Biden had asked. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier on Monday pressed Biden to have his..."
"President Trump and Joe Biden tried to shift back to their respective campaign themes after a raucous first debate that left prominent members of both parties responding to Mr. Trump’s deflections when asked to condemn white supremacists.
Mr. Biden, the former vice president, spoke Wednesday at a train station in Cleveland as he started a tour across eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania and said the debate proved that Mr. Trump doesn’t understand the lives of working-class Americans. The president, meanwhile, slammed moderator Chris Wallace, a Fox News anchor, and said..."
"The Ukraine whistleblower's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Thursday, saying President Trump's rhetoric puts his client and the intelligence community in danger.
Why it matters: Trump and his allies have called on the whistleblower to come forward and some, including Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., have publicly stated the whistleblower's alleged identity, which has been promoted among right-wing media.
What he's saying: The lawyer, Andrew Bakaj, pointed to multiple incidents, including one in September when Trump said the whistleblower was ""almost a spy""..."
"The United States is imposing a region-wide ban on all cotton and tomato products from western China’s Xinjiang region over allegations that they are made with forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Wednesday.
The action applies to raw fibers, apparel and textiles made from Xinjiang-grown cotton, as well as tomato-based food products and seeds from the region. The ban, knows as a withhold release order, also applies to products processed or manufactured in third countries, CBP officials told a news briefing."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday blamed President Trump for escalating violence at protests in cities across the country, while condemning the destructive elements of the racial justice demonstrations that he said are counterproductive to the cause.
Speaking at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Biden placed the blame for the civil unrest in the country squarely on Trump, saying the president has inflamed tensions since the police killing of George Floyd in May.
“This president long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country,” Biden said. “He can’t stop..."
"As the House moves on its article of impeachment on President Donald Trump as the solution to all that ails our nation, there remains a tremendously consequential outstanding question still begging for clarification, one that can bring the importance and utility of this action into focus.
Why should we be doing this?
Is it because now must be the moment when we rise above naked politics? Can we, in the shadows of the Capitol riots, come together in response to Trump's incitement, introducing costs to ensure nothing like it ever..."
"The United States will not lock down again to curb COVID-19 but ""things are going to get worse"" as the Delta variant fuels a surge in cases, mostly among the unvaccinated, top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday.
A sufficient percentage of Americans have now been vaccinated to avoid lockdowns, Fauci said on ABC's ""This Week"".
""Not enough to crush the outbreak, but I believe enough to not allow us to get into the situation we were in last winter,"" he said.
The average number of..."
"Global warming is happening so fast that scientists now say we'll cross a crucial temperature threshold as early as 2030 — up to a decade sooner than previously thought — according to a sweeping new UN-sponsored review of climate science published Monday.
The big picture: Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher in 2019 than at any time in at least 2 million years, and the past 50 years saw the fastest temperature increases in at least 2,000 years, according to the new assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
What they're saying: The report..."
"The US is bracing for a 20-year high in numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border, including thousands of children who are being kept in government-run detention facilities that critics say are inhumane.
A pandemic health order means that most adults and families are being summarily turned away, but the Biden administration has allowed unaccompanied children under the age of 18 to enter the US while their claims are processed.
The record-breaking influx of children being held in these camps has led US officials to send in the Federal..."
"The UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner released a long-awaited report Wednesday detailing the Chinese government's ""serious human rights violations"" in Xinjiang, which the U.S. has deemed a genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.
Driving the news: The report, which was released minutes before UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet's tenure ended, states that the Chinese government's actions ""may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.""
The UN report determines that there is evidence of “a pattern of large-scale arbitrary detention” of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs. China has claimed the detention..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s long-awaited guidance on how to safely reopen schools during the pandemic could end up keeping kids out of the classroom longer than necessary, four doctors who reviewed the guidance told CNBC.
Many public health specialists applauded the agency last week for releasing the clearest and most comprehensive federal guidance yet on whether and to what extent schools should reopen. The 35-page document defines “essential elements” of reopening that include social distancing, universal masking and some testing. It also lays out a set of..."
"Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) introduced legislation Monday to federally decriminalize and tax marijuana, an alternative to Democratic-led attempts to legalize the drug.
Details: The Republican-backed bill, called the States Reform Act, would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act while deferring to states on matters of regulation.
The legislation would implement a 3% federal tax on cannabis products to ""fund law enforcement, small business, and veterans mental health initiatives,"" according to a news release.
The measure would also release and expunge people convicted of ""nonviolent, cannabis-only related offenses"" at the federal level. The..."
"Congress passed a bill extending government funding through Dec. 3, sending the legislation to President Biden’s desk hours before current funding expires and completing one of several pressing measures before lawmakers.
Both the House and Senate provided bipartisan support for the bill, which also includes $28.6 billion in emergency disaster aid and $6.3 billion to help resettle Afghan evacuees. The bill passed 65-35 in the Senate, and 254 to 175 a few hours later in the House.
Mr. Biden must sign the bill before midnight to avoid a partial government shutdown...."
"The New York attorney general's office said in court filings late Tuesday that it has found ""significant"" evidence that former President Trump's company committed fraud, and asked a state judge to order Trump and two of his children to testify in the investigation.
Over the past year, the attorney general's office said in its filings, the investigation ""has developed significant additional evidence indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions.""
New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) has outlined the focus of..."
"Presidents Day is celebrated annually on the third Monday in February to honor the past and present U.S. presidents.
Although the day was initially established to commemorate the birth of George Washington, who was born Feb. 22, 1732, it is now recognized as a time to celebrate all presidents and the contributions they have made to the country.
Here are some inspirational quotes, courtesy Brainy Quote, from notable American presidents:
1. “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” ― Joe Biden
2. “Without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have..."
"Thousands of Republicans gathered in Houston last week for the 2022 Texas State Republican Convention.
Measures adopted to the party's platform at the convention are not set laws, rather they act as a ""mission statement"" of sorts for the party over the next two years.
Below is a roundup of the GOP's take on hot-button issues — in their own words — from the official platform document.

"Arecent article published by Politico about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy also discussed a new plan by White House allies that has left some people worried. The story mentioned that the White House was looking into increasing its fight against vaccine misinformation sent through SMS and text messages. One of the authors of the article later addressed some questions about the story, clarifying a few points that weren’t originally shared."
"One of Trump administration's top advisers on the coronavirus response said Saturday that by May, the U.S. should be in the ""ballpark"" of the diagnostic capacity needed for the economy to begin to reopen.
“By May we’ll have a lot more testing than we do now,” Admiral Brett Giroir told Bloomberg.
“By May, we certainly will be in the ballpark. Whether we are exactly there depends on some factors, including how much is circulating and where regionally this falls out. That is the correct answer, I can’t give you a..."
"Jobless claims held nearly steady last week, interrupting a downward trend and showing the labor market’s recovery remains uneven, at a time when many states are discouraging workers from tapping jobless assistance.
Initial unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, rose by 2,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 373,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 371,000. The four-week moving average, which smooths out volatility in the weekly figures, was 394,500, the lowest reading since March 2020.
The recent level of new claims is well..."
"When Rachel Adams-Kaplan heard that the Covid-19 vaccines would soon be available for her children, she knew she would get her 7-year-old son vaccinated right away. She wasn’t so sure about her 11-year-old daughter.
Children between 5 and 11 years of age began getting Covid-19 shots last week, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Pfizer Inc. PFE -0.82% and BioNTech SE’s BNTX -1.32% vaccine for that age group. Some 900,000 children in that age group had received a first dose through Wednesday, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff..."
"The United States has now recorded more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally, crossing a once-unthinkable milestone about two years after the first cases upended everyday life and quickly transformed it.
The 1 million mark is a stark reminder of the staggering grief and loss caused by the pandemic even as the threat posed by the virus wanes in the minds of many people. It represents about one death for every 327 Americans, or more than the entire population of San Francisco or Seattle.
By the..."
"President Trump on Monday slammed journalist and New York University professor Ian Bremmer for attributing a ""completely ludicrous quote"" to him.
""@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP 'a completely ludicrous quote,' attributing it to me,"" Trump tweeted amid a four-day state visit to Japan.
""This is what’s going on in the age of Fake News,"" Trump added. ""People think they can say anything and get away with it. Really, the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable!"""

"President Biden on Tuesday said that ramped-up coronavirus vaccine production will provide enough doses for 300 million Americans by the end May.
Why it matters: That's two months sooner than Biden's previous promise of enough vaccines for all American adults by the end of July.
The accelerated timeline also comes on the heels of pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck teaming up with Johnson & Johnson to quickly produce its one-shot COVID-19 vaccine.
J&J's vaccine received its emergency use authorization last Saturday, joining Pfizer and Moderna on the vaccine market."
"President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 16 for their first in-person summit, the White House announced on Tuesday.
Why it matters: The highly anticipated summit offers an early test of the Biden administration's goal of holding Russia accountable for its abuses while seeking a more ""stable"" and ""predictable"" relationship.
The big picture: Tensions between the U.S. and Russia have soared in the first six months of the Biden presidency."
"The California Legislature sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a first-in-the-nation bill Monday creating a council to regulate wages and working conditions in fast food restaurants. 
The bill would give labor advocates a long-elusive bargaining foothold in a low-wage industry that employs more than half a million non-unionized workers statewide.
Pushed by the Service Employees International Union and fiercely opposed by business groups, the FAST Recovery Act barely passed the state Senate with the minimum number of votes. The vote was just as narrow in the Assembly hours later. Several Democrats abstained;..."
"The House Wednesday passed legislation to nullify President Barack Obama ’s immigration policies, tying the contentious matter to a bill funding homeland security and setting up a clash with Democrats who are expected block the measure in the Senate.
The vote was 236-191 for the spending bill after the House easily approved amendments to undo the president’s executive actions last year, and to block a program that gives safe harbor to young people brought to the U.S. as children. The latter amendment was adopted only narrowly, with centrist Republicans opposing..."
"The Justice Department on Tuesday filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho’s near total ban on abortion, setting up the Biden administration’s first legal battle over abortion access since the Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.
The lawsuit says Idaho’s abortion restrictions unlawfully conflict with a federal law that requires hospitals accepting Medicare to provide emergency treatments, which can sometimes include abortion.
“If a patient comes into the emergency room with a medical emergency jeopardizing the patient’s life or health, hospitals must..."
"President Biden announced Tuesday a goal to administer at least one shot of the coronavirus vaccine to 70 percent of U.S. adults by July 4, as the country moves to vaccinate harder-to-reach Americans.
Biden, in a speech Tuesday afternoon at the White House, also set a goal to have 160 million U.S. adults fully vaccinated by Independence Day.
Together, those goals will mean about 100 million more shots, both first and second doses, across the next 60 days, a senior administration official said.
The goal also acknowledges a slowdown in..."
"Congrats to Sundar Pichai, who just got promoted to the worst job in Silicon Valley.
On Tuesday, Google’s parent company Alphabet dropped the bombshell that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping down as CEO and president, respectively, and that the 47-year-old Pichai will become CEO of all of Alphabet."
"The departure of Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin from managerial roles at Alphabet Inc. marks the end of an era for the search-engine giant, though analysts doubt there will be meaningful changes in the way the company is run.
Investors, though, may take comfort in the chance of a shift in how the company approaches its financials now that Google CEO Sundar Pichai has been elevated to the top role at parent company Alphabet GOOG, +2.00% GOOGL, +1.89% as well. Analysts say the leadership transition could prompt a..."
"We're just pennies away from $5 for a gallon of regular gas, according to the latest data from AAA, which reported the national average at the pump on Tuesday is about $4.92.
Heading into summer, analysts predict even higher prices: According to a report by JPMorgan, the US could surpass $6.20 a gallon by August. 
Thirteen states -- Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii,  Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington --  have already blown past the $5 threshold, with California leading the pack at $6.37 a gallon.

"The lawyers for a whistleblower whose complaint triggered a US presidential impeachment inquiry say Donald Trump's words are endangering their client.
Since the transcript of his call with the president of Ukraine was revealed, Mr Trump has called for the anonymous whistleblower to be unmasked.
Democrats say the whistleblower will testify to Congress ""very soon"" once steps are taken to protect identity.
Mr Trump has suggested his opponents could be arrested for ""treason"".

"Four days before the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks that triggered the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban declared the restoration of their Islamic Emirate and named a new government, excluding other political forces and giving control of internal security to a U.S.-designated terrorist.
Afghanistan’s new administration, formed three weeks after the Taliban conquered Kabul and deposed the Afghan republic, prompting a massive exodus of foreigners and Afghans at risk, included no women or members of the Shiite minority. Its makeup, unveiled at a hastily called nighttime press conference, belied the..."
"Former President Donald Trump‘s lawyers filed their response to the Justice Department’s request to stay the order for a special master Monday.
The lawyers go through several points to say that the government won’t be harmed by a special master reviewing the documents or by holding off any criminal investigation while the review is taking place. 
Both sides are expected to file their arguments on who the special master should be.
“Given the significance of this investigation, the Court recognizes, as does President Trump, that it must be conducted in the public..."
"Lawyers representing Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) on Monday called on Hillary Clinton to retract her comments alleging that the 2020 presidential candidate was a favorite candidate of the Russians, accusing the 2016 Democratic nominee of defamation.
""Your statement is defamatory, and we demand that you retract it immediately,"" Gabbard's lawyer wrote in a letter, demanding that Clinton verbally retract the comments and post the retraction on Twitter.
Clinton's spokesman declined to comment on the letter.
Clinton made the remarks last month on the ""Campaign HQ"" podcast.

"The US Supreme Court has upheld the use of a contentious drug used in executions, saying it does not violate a ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
The ruling is a setback to opponents of the death penalty, who say midazolam is not suitable for lethal injections.
The drug raised concerns after it was used in executions in three US states in 2014 that took longer than usual.
Executions have been delayed recently in the US amid problems buying drugs as many firms have refused to sell..."
"President Trump said Thursday that he would not participate in a virtual debate, minutes after the organizing commission announced that next week's event would be virtual to protect the health of those involved.
“I’m not going to do a virtual debate,” Trump, who was diagnosed last week with the coronavirus, said in an interview on Fox Business, claiming the Commission on Presidential Debates is “trying to protect” Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
“I’m not going to waste my time with a virtual debate. That’s not what debating is all about. You..."
"US guest of honour and Fox News host Tucker Carlson was granted a lightning visit by military helicopter to Hungary's 175km (109-mile) high-tech, high-cost razor-wire border fence with Serbia this week.
He liked what he saw. After praising the fence for being so ""clean and orderly"", in contrast to the ""chaos"" on the US-Mexican border, he told his viewers: ""It doesn't require a GDP the size of the US, it doesn't require high-tech walls, guns, or surveillance equipment. All it requires is the will to do it.""
And he praised..."
"A shooting at an Indiana mall Sunday that left three innocent people dead and two more injured could have been far worse if not for the actions of an armed civilian, authorities say.
Police are calling 22-year-old Elisjsha Dicken a hero after they say he shot and killed the suspected 20-year-old gunman with a firearm he was legally carrying.
“Many more people would have died last night if not for a responsible, armed citizen that took action very quickly within the first two minutes of the shooting,” said Greenwood Police Chief Jim..."
"President Biden is struggling with a Gordian knot on immigration that there's little he can do to untangle: The nation's broken system is making it harder than it should be to manage the Afghan refugee crisis — and the Afghan refugee crisis is making it harder to fix the system.
By the numbers: If the military’s task of adding 50,000 spots to bases by mid-September to temporarily house Afghan refugees sounds like a lot, consider that there have been more than 1.2 million undocumented border crossings since last October.
Meanwhile, pandemic..."
"House Judiciary Committee Democrats called on Vice President Mike Pence in a letter Wednesday to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Trump from office, saying he incited the riot that violently breached the U.S. Capitol earlier that day.
Why it matters: The letter comes as Republican officials are considering drastic steps to stop the president, including censure, impeachment or invoking the 25th Amendment, which would allow Pence to step in if Trump were found to be unable to perform his duties, Axios' Jonathan Swan and Margaret Talev report.
What..."
"resident Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has chronicled his harrowing journey through drug addiction, alcoholism and romantic relationship with his deceased brother's wife in his memoir ""Beautiful Things: A Memoir"" that will hit the shelves on April 6.
In the prologue, Hunter takes the readers through his drug addiction, which led him to cook his own crack cocaine, The New York Times reported.
“I’ve bought crack cocaine on the streets of Washington, D.C., and cooked up my own inside a hotel bungalow in Los Angeles. I’ve been so desperate for..."
"The U.S. military is ""weak"" and ""at growing risk of not being able to meet the demands of defending America's vital national interests,"" says the Heritage Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank in its latest report titled: 2023 Index of U.S. Military Strength.
Considering the possibility of a competitor taking advantage of the U.S. being pre-occupied with another challenge, the current military force is at significant risk of being unable to tackle a single major regional conflict, which means it is ""certainly ill-equipped to handle two nearly simultaneous"" major..."
"When officials signed off Aug. 29 on a Hellfire strike to obliterate a white Toyota they had been monitoring for eight hours, the belief was that it contained ISIS fighters carrying a bomb intended for U.S. troops outside the Kabul airport. The head of U.S. Central Command announced Friday that they were very wrong.
Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie concurred with previous media reports that the strike had killed as many as 10 people, including seven children.
“This strike was taken in the earnest belief that it would prevent an imminent threat to our forces..."
"Longtime Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been found guilty of fraud and embezzlement charges, as well as contempt of court, according to a verdict handed down on Tuesday.
The court sentenced Navalny to nine years in a maximum security prison. A judge also ordered Navalny to pay a fine of 1.2 million rubles (about $11,500, €10,400).
Navalny and his supporters have decried the charges as politically motivated. He is already serving a two-and-a-half year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday declared martial law in four recently annexed regions of Ukraine.
Why it matters: The move gives Russia greater control over the territories — Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk. None of them are entirely controlled by Russian forces.
What they're saying: ""I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four constituent entities of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said at a Security Council meeting Wednesday, Russian state news agency TASS reported.
""It will immediately be sent for approval to the Federation Council, and the State Duma will be informed of the decision,""..."
"A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants.
The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"".
The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"".
He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"".
Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting..."
"Since President Joe Biden took office and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas altered federal immigration policies, roughly 5 million people from over 150 countries have entered the U.S. illegally, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data and border agents who provide ""gotaway"" numbers to The Center Square.
""Gotaways"" is the term CBP uses for those who’ve intentionally entered the U.S. illegally and evaded law enforcement who haven’t made asylum or immigration claims. While CBP collects ""gotaway"" data, it does not report that information publicly. The Center Square..."
"WASHINGTON — The U.S. jobs market ended 2019 on a sour note, with December’s payroll and wage growth missing expectations, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 145,000 while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.5%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for job growth of 160,000. The jobless rate met expectations for staying at a 50-year low."
"America’s gross national debt has surpassed $31 trillion for the first time.
The figure was revealed in a Treasury Department report released Tuesday and comes at a time when the economy faces inflation and higher interest rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government borrowed more money to support the economy as lockdowns disrupted labor markets and supply chains.
The costs of borrowing remain higher, and with economists warning of an impending recession, the milestone comes at an inopportune and volatile moment. A Wall Street sell-off from all-time highs in January has been..."
"President Joe Biden said the U.S. military would defend Taiwan if the island was invaded by Chinese forces, in a broad-ranging interview on CBS 60 Minutes broadcast on Sunday where he also said the Covid-19 pandemic was now “over” and chided his predecessor’s handling of critical government documents.
Biden told CBS that U.S. forces will defend Taiwan in the event of an “unprecedented attack” and when pressed on if this meant sending troops to defend the island from a Chinese invasion, Biden said “yes”.
Prior to this, Biden said the U.S. still..."
"The U.S. hit another grim milestone in the pandemic Tuesday, reaching more than 600,000 Covid fatalities as the nation races to administer at least one vaccine shot to 70% of adult Americans by the Fourth of July.
Deaths in the U.S. have been slowing for months, according to Johns Hopkins University data, due largely to an aggressive campaign to vaccinate the nation’s elderly and medically vulnerable people who are most at risk of dying from Covid. About 76% of Americans 65 and older, the group that accounted for a majority..."
"The Idaho Supreme Court on Friday put a stay on the state’s controversial new abortion law, set to go into effect later this month, pending a lawsuit filed last week by Planned Parenthood.
Idaho’s law, inspired by Texas legislation, would ban most abortions after about six weeks and allow certain family members to sue abortion providers for at least $20,000. Republican lawmakers argued that six weeks is when a so-called fetal heartbeat can be detected, though medical experts have said it’s better described as electrical activity. Physicians said most people..."
"Daniel Pryor, who lobbies for governments to shrink the state and cut taxes, feels Liz Truss's brief, disastrous spell as prime minister has killed off his dream of a low-tax, deregulated British economy for at least a generation.
Pryor, who works at the Adam Smith Institute in London, laughs bitterly at the irony that Truss, who said on Thursday she would resign, was forced to abandon her libertarian economic policies by the same free markets she cherishes.
The Adam Smith Institute, and other think tanks which provided much of Truss's inspiration,..."
"Google has agreed to pay $391.5 million in a privacy settlement with 40 state attorneys general over its location tracking practices, according to Oregon's Department of Justice on Monday.
The agreement is the largest consumer privacy settlement by states in US history. States argued that the search giant misled people into thinking they had turned off proximity-based data collection when the company continued to allocate that information. Google agreed to improve its location tracking disclosures starting in 2023.
""For years Google has prioritized profit over their users' privacy,"" Oregon Attorney General Ellen..."
"AFood and Drug Administration advisory panel voted unanimously Thursday in favor of authorizing booster shots of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine to people 65 and older, those 18 to 64 with risk factors for severe Covid-19, and those whose jobs put them at high risk of serious complications of Covid-19, such as health care workers.
After hours of deliberation, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted 19-to-0 that the Moderna booster should be authorized for these groups. The panel also discussed at what point boosters should be recommended to..."
"The Kentucky attorney general’s office released recordings of the grand jury proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case Friday, including officers’ testimony that they repeatedly knocked and announced themselves before entering her apartment.
That issue is one of several points of contention in the wake of the grand jury’s decision last week in the case of Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed in March by Louisville police executing a search warrant at her apartment. The grand jury indicted one officer—former Detective Brett Hankison—on charges of wanton endangerment for firing into..."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may urge Americans to cover their faces in public to protect themselves and others amid the coronavirus pandemic, The Washington Post is reporting.
The recommendation, if approved, would call for Americans to use cloth coverings instead of surgical and N95 masks, which have been in short supply at hospitals and medical facilities across the country, the Post noted, adding that the coverings could potentially lower the risk of an infected person transmitting the virus.
Talks are still ongoing, an anonymous federal..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday recommended a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot for children as young as 5, aimed at the Omicron variant, hours after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the shot.
The big picture: The announcement comes as the White House continues to monitor a rise in the COVID-19 subvariants emerging and evolving throughout the world.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky signed off on a decision memo expanding the use of the shots without waiting for a meeting of the CDC’s advisory committee, CNBC reports.
With approval from the CDC and the FDA, pharmacies can now..."
"A key witness in the House impeachment inquiry was ordered not to appear at a scheduled deposition on Tuesday, ramping up tensions between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration.
The State Department instructed Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland not to appear for the deposition, according to his counsel.
Sondland, a wealthy hotelier who had donated $1 million to President Trump's inaugural committee before taking his government position, was a figure in the text messages released by Democrats last week that showed administration officials discussing Trump's communications with..."
"Outgoing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) on Sunday said he had ""mixed feelings"" about the New York City Council's recent decision to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.
While appearing on ""Fox News Sunday,"" de Blasio was asked by host Chris Wallace why he did not veto the measure over his concerns surrounding the legality of the measure.
""I have mixed feelings. I've been very open about it on this law and I think there are big legal questions, but I also respect the city council. They made a decision,"" de..."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced a COVID-19 vaccine distribution partnership with Publix grocery stores weeks after the company gave $100,000 to his PAC, CBS' ""60 Minutes"" reported Sunday, citing campaign finance records. DeSantis and Publix deny any wrongdoing.
Why it matters: DeSantis has been criticized for directing vaccines toward wealthy communities, with some who benefitted from the vaccine pop-ups also donating to the governor's political action committee, per Axios' Tampa Bay reporter Ben Montgomery."
"Job growth was stronger than expected in October despite Federal Reserve interest rate increases aimed at slowing what is still a relatively strong labor market.
Nonfarm payrolls grew by 261,000 for the month while the unemployment rate moved higher to 3.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday. Those payroll numbers were better than the Dow Jones estimate for 205,000 more jobs, but worse than the 3.5% estimate for the unemployment rate.
Although the number was better than expected, it still marked the slowest pace of job gains since December 2020.
Stocks rose..."
"As Congress tries to hash out a stimulus package potentially worth more than $1 trillion, Democrats are gearing up for a fight over whether direct payments to Americans struggling with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will be enough.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is among those arguing for expanded unemployment insurance as a source of relief.
“A single $1,000 check would help someone pay their landlord in March but what happens after that?” the New York Democrat said on the chamber floor Wednesday. “A thousand dollars goes by..."
"The U.S. on Wednesday reported a record 36,880 new coronavirus cases more than two months after its previous record for daily infections, a signal that the country is struggling to contain the pandemic.
Wednesday's total is 2,000 more than on Tuesday, when 34,700 new cases of COVID-19 nationally were reported, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
New daily cases in the U.S. had hit a peak at 36,739 cases on April 24 and had consistently been on a downward trajectory for weeks until recent spikes in a slate..."
"A former career official at the National Security Council claims her pre-publication review of former national security adviser John Bolton's explosive book on President Trump was ""commandeered by political appointees for a seemingly political purpose,"" according to a letter from her lawyers filed in court on Tuesday.
Why it matters: The White House fought against the publication of Bolton's book for most of the year on the grounds that it contained harmful and ""significant amounts of classified information.""
According to Knight's lawyers, White House aides falsely asserted that details in..."
"A former National Security Council (NSC) official says the White House intervened in “unprecedented” fashion in the prepublication review process of former national security adviser John Bolton’s book in an effort to deem information classified and prevent the memoir’s publication.
Kenneth Wainstein, a lawyer for Ellen Knight, a career federal employee and a former NSC senior director who led the prepublication review of Bolton’s book, filed a letter in federal court Wednesday detailing Knight’s concerns with the actions of White House officials in the review of Bolton’s memoir, “The..."
"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign has more people of color among its senior staff than President Trump's reelection effort, according to data regarding the diversity of their staffs.
Thirty-five percent of Biden’s full-time staff are people of color, the campaign told The Hill Sunday. Among senior staff, 36 percent are people of color, according to the campaign."
"Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives rolled out an agenda on Friday aimed at tackling a range of priorities from inflation and crime to election accountability, which they hope will give them the upper hand against Democrats in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
The agenda, called the ""Commitment to America,"" claims to show voters how Republicans would address problems they blame on President Joe Biden and the Democrats, should they succeed in winning the House majority.
Elements of the plan, which lawmakers spent months crafting, began to appear online on Thursday...."
"Journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones on Tuesday announced she has decided to reject an offer to serve as the chair of the journalism department at the University of North Carolina, and that she will take a similar position at Howard University. 
The decision follows a massive controversy at the North Carolina school, which initially did not offer Hannah-Jones tenure.
""It's a very difficult decision, not one I wanted to make,"" she told Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning."" "
"On Friday afternoon, Naeem Hussain attended the funeral service for two Muslim men who were killed in the past two weeks. He joined other mourners afterward, sharing a meal, at the Islamic Center of New Mexico. Then he left.
Several hours later, a little before midnight, Naeem Hussain was shot to death in a parking lot of an organization that offers services for refugees and asylum seekers near San Mateo and Copper NE, according to the Islamic Center’s spokesman.
His death was the latest in what police suspect is a..."
"The battle between small-time traders and hedge funds that has shaken U.S. and European stock markets moved into Asia on Thursday, with surges in several Australian companies joining a list of social-media hyped moves that have cost financial institutions billions of dollars.
Heavily shorted Australian shares, including Webjet and Tassal Group, climbed more than 5% even as Sydney’s benchmark ASX 200 index fell 2%. [.AX]
In New York, GameStop, the video game chain at the heart of the slugfest between Wall Street and Main Street, added another 37% in early..."
"Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Tuesday will become the 16th—and perhaps final—major Republican candidate to enter the 2016 presidential race, rounding out the crowded field with his own brand of compassionate conservatism and blunt talk.
The two-term Republican governor’s bid will test whether a candidate who has bucked the right flank of his party on issues ranging from Medicaid expansion to immigration can gain traction in a primary."
"U.S. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps has weighed in on the controversy surrounding the University of Pennsylvania's Lia Thomas, calling the transgender swimmer’s recent success “complicated.”
“I believe that we all should feel comfortable with who we are in our own skin, but I think sports should all be played on an even playing field,” he said in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour late last week.
Phelps added that he’s unsure what an “even playing field” should look like.
“It’s very complicated,” he said."
"Senate Democrats failed to advance a bill seeking to ensure women’s access to abortion, in a vote designed to draw a clear contrast with Republicans ahead of a potential Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade looming just months before the midterm elections.
The vote was 49 in favor to 51 against, falling short of the 60 votes needed to advance the Women’s Health Protection Act.
Democrats held the vote despite knowing it was certain to fail in the 50-50 Senate, where abortion stances split almost entirely along party lines. No Republicans..."
"President Trump said he would sign an executive order on Thursday to ""promote patriotic education"" through an effort called the 1776 Commission, while denouncing a New York Times' project that investigated the impacts of racial injustice for Black Americans.
The big picture: The 1619 project dug into the personal histories of Black Americans in the U.S. who have faced present-day systematic inequality in housing and farming, as well as how the legacy of slavery altered health care access for Black Americans and fueled the country's early economy.
Driving the news:..."
"Friday marks the 55th anniversary of Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the abolishment of slavery that takes place every year on June 19.
The date refers not to the end of legal slavery in the United States but to the gap in time before everyone heard the news.
“It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it,” President Trump said of Juneteenth this week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Many schools don’t teach the history of Juneteenth and it is not recognized..."
"China has criticised a historic security pact between the US, UK and Australia, describing it as ""extremely irresponsible"" and ""narrow-minded"".
The deal will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.
It is being widely viewed as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea.
The region has been a flashpoint for years and tensions there remain high.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the alliance risked ""severely damaging regional peace... and intensifying the arms race""...."
"People who have received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine are likely susceptible to infection from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, but a third shot restores antibody activity against the virus, the companies said Wednesday.
Their findings are based on lab experiments using the blood of people who have received the vaccine. In a press release, the companies reported a 25-fold reduction on average in the levels of neutralizing antibody activity against the Omicron variant in people who had received two doses of their Covid-19 vaccine. But they also..."
"The speech praised India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and highlighted the success of recent policies to improve the country.
We looked at some of the claims.
Claim 1: Trump said: ""Since the turn of the century, the size of the Indian economy has grown over six times in size.""
Reality check: Measured in terms of GDP - the sum of the value of goods and services produced in the economy - President Trump is correct.
In 2000, India's GDP was $477 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)...."
"The Secret Service is coming under intense scrutiny after a man who hopped the White House fence made it all the way through the front door before being apprehended.
President Barack Obama and his daughters had just departed the White House on Friday evening when an intruder scaled the north fence, darted across the lawn and into the presidential residence, where agents nabbed him. The security breach triggered a rare evacuation of much of the White House, with Secret Service officers drawing their guns as they rushed staffers and journalists..."
"Small groups of Walt Disney Co. DIS 1.07% employees across the U.S. took Tuesday off from work and gathered to protest what they described as the company’s continued failure to support LGBT employees.
The walkouts mark the beginning of a third week of turmoil inside the entertainment giant as its leadership struggles to contain fallout from its bungled response to a Republican-led education bill in Florida, which many employees said targeted the LGBT community.
The Parental Rights in Education bill, passed March 8 by the Florida Senate, prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation..."
"The United States has found its first cases of a potent coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa, health officials in the state of South Carolina said on Thursday. Viruses mutate frequently, and several mutated viruses have been identified. The presence of the South African variant in the United States is especially concerning because several laboratory studies have shown that it reduces vaccine effectiveness.
Another concern, according to the nominee for U.S. surgeon general, is that the South African variant could require larger doses of antibody for treatment."
"A House Democrat announced Tuesday that he is launching an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s expected speech to the Republican National Convention, raising concerns that the move is an illegal violation of the Hatch Act and a breach of State Department regulations.
Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs panel's subcommittee on oversight and investigations, raised his concerns in a letter to Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun and requested information on the secretary’s planned remarks."
"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) had a message for her Democratic colleagues before she flew home to Arizona for the weekend: She's preserving her options.
Why it matters: Sinema has leverage and she knows it. Any potential modification to the Democrat's climate and deficit reduction package — like knocking out the $14 billion provision on carried interest — could cause the fragile deal to collapse.
Her posture is causing something between angst and fear in the Democratic caucus as senators wait for her to render a verdict on the secret deal announced by Senate..."
"Former Trump Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Wednesday offered lawmakers a limited defense of the Russia investigation he oversaw, as he came under increasing criticism from Republicans.
Mr. Rosenstein said he stood by his decision to appoint special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any links between that effort and the Trump campaign, but said he didn’t know then of the alleged improprieties that have surfaced in recent months on aspects of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s handling of the investigation.
“I..."
"Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) will at last get his confirmation hearing to be President Trump’s next director of national intelligence — a moment delayed for weeks by a coronavirus pandemic that shut down much of the country.
Ratcliffe is expected to be grilled by members of both parties on the Senate Intelligence Committee over whether he will be an independent voice for intelligence.
Critics say Trump is seeking to install a loyalist with Ratcliffe.
“While I am willing to give Mr. Ratcliffe the benefit of the doubt in the..."
"A California transit employee killed eight co-workers and wounded another before taking his own life on Wednesday,the latest in a spate of deadly U.S. mass shootings, prompting the state’s governor to ask: “What the hell is wrong with us?”
Authorities did not immediately offer many details or a possible motive for the shooting, which unfolded about 6:30 a.m. Pacific Time (1330 GMT) at a light-rail yard for commuter trains of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), in the heart of Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay Area."
"The White House will deploy 1,000 military medical personnel to support hospitals facing a surge of patients infected with Covid this winter, and will purchase 500 million at-home tests that Americans can order online for free with delivery beginning in January, according to senior administration officials.
President Joe Biden will announce the plan in a speech later Tuesday addressing how the administration is preparing for the highly contagious omicron variant of Covid-19. Biden warned last week that the unvaccinated face a winter of “severe illness and death,” calling on them to get immunized and..."
"Tuesday’s primaries and runoffs saw the downfall of at least three House incumbents, as well as the limits of top Republicans and Democrats to sway the results of key primary races.
In Colorado, more moderate Republicans beat out candidates who cast themselves as staunch allies of former President Trump in a handful of statewide GOP primaries, though the former president still managed to notch crucial victories in Illinois.
Meanwhile, establishment Democrats in New York cruised to victory over progressive challengers. 
Here are five takeaways from Tuesday’s primaries and runoffs.
Democratic..."
"The New York Times is facing blowback after its executive editor admitted to removing a controversial passage in a story focusing on a 1993 sexual assault allegation against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
The criticism comes after the Times published an article looking into allegations made against Biden by Tara Reade, who says the then-senator sexually assaulted her when she worked as a Biden senate staffer.
“The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them..."
"Democratic presidential candidates have given their reaction to a warning by former President Barack Obama against moving too far left in politics.
Mr Obama's rare intervention into the Democratic race was a talking point at campaign events on Saturday.
Some Democrats called for unity, while others defended their policy agenda.
Nearly 20 candidates remain in the running and there is much debate over the best approach to taking on President Trump next year."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday declared a state of emergency over gun violence, which he said is now claiming more lives than Covid-19 and is a threat to the broader economic recovery.
The designation will allow the state to quickly release $138.7 million of funding for a series of initiatives, including summer recreation and violence interruption, which already operate in some areas of the state’s cities.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, also signed legislation that would allow people harmed by firearms to sue gun sellers and manufacturers if those..."
"U.S. consumer inflation eased slightly in September from a year earlier, but price increases excluding energy and food accelerated to a new four-decade high.   
The Labor Department on Thursday said that the consumer-price index, a measure of what consumers pay for goods and services, gained 8.2% in September from the same month a year ago, down from 8.3% in August. That was down from an annual increase of 8.5% in July and 9.1% in June, which was the highest inflation rate in four decades.
So-called core CPI, which excludes volatile energy..."
"Former President Trump made an approving remark about his own vice president being hanged following chants at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to hang then-Vice President Pence, according to a report in The New York Times.
The report is based on an account of an incident at the White House that was reported to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.
It’s no secret that Trump was unhappy with Pence, who had made it clear that on Jan. 6 he would not be questioning the results of the election. Pence’s..."
"The last of the midterm primaries took place Tuesday night. After making over 200 endorsements in the Republican primaries, former President Donald Trump achieved many notable wins, while also notching a few significant losses.
Trump’s track record of endorsement victories and defeats are seen by many as an indication of his strength in the Republican Party, and whether he will be competitive enough in 2024 to mount a presidential comeback campaign.
Most of Trump’s endorsed candidates across the U.S. House, Senate and various statewide races ran unopposed or faced political..."
"Donald Trump has shown great pride in hand-picking the next wave of Republican stars.
Back when he was still in the White House, he wrote on Twitter: ""As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win!""
In this primary season, he hasn't been far off.
Over the past several months, candidates endorsed by Mr Trump have pocketed victories across the country, winning 92% of the time.
From his home in Palm Beach, Florida, the self-proclaimed ""king"" of endorsements has weighed in on almost..."
"The former officer who killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright was taken into custody and will be charged with second-degree manslaughter, a day after she resigned from the Brooklyn Center police department.
In an email, Washington County Attorney Pete Orput confirmed plans to charge former officer Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the police force. He said the charges would be filed later Wednesday.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison under Minnesota law.
State officials said Ms. Potter would be booked into Hennepin County Jail. She was..."
"Spotify will remove Neil Young's music from its streaming platform, because the 76-year-old rock icon objected to the company's response to vaccine misinformation.
The big picture: This matters more than you'd think, given the popularity of old music.
70% of the music streamed online is older than 18 months, according to MRC Data's 2021 year-end report.
Yes, but: Many of the big new releases of 2021 were dropped because tour dates got COVID-canceled, Matt Yazge, vice president of research business for MRC Data, tells Axios.
61% of U.S. music listeners say that they are interested in..."
"The U.S. will impose sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced on Friday.
Why it matters: It is extremely rare for the U.S. to sanction a sitting world leader, and the Kremlin had previously said it would consider sanctions on Putin himself to be a de facto severing of relations between the U.S. and Russia."
"Multiple posts on social media make the claim that 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is proposing a 52% tax rate on incomes above $29,000 a year. Examples of the claim appear on Facebook here , Instagram here , Twitter here , and Reddit here .
The posts give a breakdown of the potential impacts of this extreme tax-hike alongside one of Sanders’ signature proposals: the increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour (see here) . Some of the posts claim that Sanders said he proposed a 52%..."
"The FBI made significant errors in 2016 when it sought to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser, an internal watchdog said, as part of what it found to be a justified probe into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The report’s scathing assessment of the FBI’s actions make it likely to further inflame a partisan debate about the propriety of the agency’s investigation into Trump campaign associates. The Justice Department’s inspector general found the FBI had information that undercut material it was relying on from a controversial former British..."
"After a long and much-publicized interruption, Chris Cuomo wants to get after it again.
Cuomo, who made that phrase the mission statement for his 9 p.m. program on CNN, is taking his bulldog demeanor and lean-in anchoring style to NewsNation, the still-nascent news outlet backed by large station owner Nexstar Media, which has in recent months made a series of acquisitions aimed at bolstering its presence in the media sector. Cuomo will join the NewsNation primetime lineup in the fall.

"The No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday said former President Donald Trump was “poisoning our democratic system” with his persistent false claims that his November election defeat was the result of fraud.
U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a Trump critic, assailed him in a tweet, risking further raising the ire of the former president's allies in their Republican Party.
""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their..."
"The Secret Service came under withering criticism on Tuesday over the recent White House security breach and amid new revelations that an armed felon rode an elevator with President Barack Obama days earlier.
Fresh details of the Sept. 19 intrusion, aired at a House Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday, revealed numerous security lapses that allowed Omar J. Gonzalez to get farther into the White House than previously known after he had scaled a fence and darted across the lawn. Mr. Gonzalez knocked over a Secret Service officer and hopscotched through the..."
"Accused pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s death this morning — reportedly a suicide, according to federal officials — is an inexplicable end to a bizarre, tragic case that only got more disturbing the more we learned about it.
The fact that one of the country’s highest-profile federal prisoners could even commit suicide defies all logic and belief.
His death raises doubts about officials’ actions. The FBI says it will investigate; Attorney General William Barr says he is “appalled” by what happened; members of Congress such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are..."
"President Trump and his allies have filed lawsuits alleging election irregularities or improper ballot-counting procedures in five states where President-elect Joe Biden leads.
Some suits seek to delay state officials from certifying final results, a rare step that judges likely would be reluctant to take without proof of irregularities significant enough to change the election outcome, according to legal analysts. Judges have rejected several Trump campaign and allied claims."
"The White House said that abortion ""is under assault as never before"" on the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that enshrined the procedure as a constitutional right.
Saturday's statement comes a day after an anti-abortion march in Washington, DC where activists expressed hope Supreme Court justices weighing up a Mississippi case would eventually overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling made on January 22, 1973.
Tens of thousands of people joined the annual March for Life protest where the group's president Jeanne Mancini told the crowd ""we are hoping and..."
"Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) on Sunday rejected a report that there is a dispute among members of the Jan. 6 House select committee regarding whether to make a criminal referral for former President Trump.
The New York Times reported that members of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol are divided over whether to make a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for Trump, even though the panel has determined that they have the evidence for such a move.
The information the committee has reportedly justifies..."
"Democratic congressional leaders said they walked out of a White House meeting Wednesday on Syria after what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a “meltdown.”
After top Democrats left the bipartisan meeting with Trump, Pelosi told reporters that the president appeared “shaken up” by a House vote condemning his decision to remove U.S. forces from northern Syria. The House approved the resolution in an overwhelming 354-60 vote, as even a majority of Trump’s Republican Party supported it.
“That’s why we couldn’t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating..."
"British neo-Nazi Satanist group should be outlawed by the government as a terrorist organisation, according to a report from anti-racism campaigners.
Hope Not Hate has used its annual State of Hate report to call for the Order of Nine Angles (ONA) to be banned.
The Home Office said the list of proscribed terrorist groups was kept ""under review.""
Last week two British extreme right-wing organisations were added their number."
"Wisconsin’s governor on Monday deployed his state’s National Guard to Kenosha following a night of sometimes-violent unrest that came after police in the lakeside city shot a Black man multiple times in the back.
Governor Tony Evers also called a special legislative session to take up a package of bills aimed at addressing problems with law enforcement following the shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake late Sunday afternoon. Blake’s three sons saw the shooting, a lawyer for the family said.
After being rushed to a hospital, Blake was out of surgery..."
"U.S. oil tumbled more than 8% on Monday, breaking below $100 per barrel, amid talks between Russia and Ukraine as well as new Covid-19 lockdowns in China — which could dent demand.
West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, lost 8.75% to trade at $99.76 per barrel at the lows of the day. International benchmark Brent crude shed 8% to $103.68 per barrel.
In afternoon trading some of the losses were recovered. WTI settled 5.78% lower at $103.01 per barrel, with Brent finishing the day at $106.90 per barrel, for..."
"President Joe Biden’s honeymoon period came to an end this summer, due, in part, to the rise of the delta variant and a chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan. But even as new reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations fall and attention on Afghanistan fades, his approval rating hasn’t bounced back.
Though Biden was popular during his early months in office, in July, his approval rating began to take a dip. In late August, his disapproval rating overtook his approval rating for the first time, and he hasn’t recovered.
Currently, Biden has a 49.2%..."
"Americans are voicing their disapproval of President Joe Biden, nearly nine months after he took office.
In a string of national polls in the last week, an aggregate of 49.2% of voters surveyed disapproved of Biden’s handling of the presidency, while 44.5% approved, according to the FiveThirtyEight polling site. Five of the recent polls registered disapproval of the country’s 46th president at the RealClearPolitics site, with three favorable.
Analysts say the drop in Biden’s standing has been particularly precipitous among independent voters who helped him win the White House last..."
"President Joe Biden reacted on Friday to a disappointing April jobs report by saying the U.S. economy has a “long way to go” before recovering from its pandemic slump, and he urged Washington to do more to help the American people.
U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed last month, likely restrained by shortages of workers and raw materials. Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs, well below the nearly 1 million jobs economists expected and a sharp contrast to steady increases in growth from January to March.
Biden and his team..."
"A mass shooting at a Buffalo grocery store that left 10 people dead has placed a national spotlight on a far-right conspiracy theory espoused by the suspected shooter.
The so-called “great replacement theory” asserts that there is an intentional effort to replace white Americans with people of color by encouraging immigration.
Payton Gendron, the 18-year-old suspect in Saturday’s attack, cited the theory in a manifesto he published online, while authorities say he intentionally planned the attack in a location with a significant Black population. Eleven of the 13 victims killed or..."
"The odds were stacked against Donald Trump and Republicans and their seemingly star-crossed convention. In the last two months the venue was changed twice as coronavirus cases spiked in the Sun Belt after an earlier flattening. Midsummer brought no relief from either police violence against African Americans or the violent response from protesters. As if to cue up the chaos, police officers in Kenosha, Wis., shot a black man in the back Sunday night. It was a depressingly familiar scene, caught on videotape, as was the demoralizing response: rioting and..."
"Kim Potter was found guilty on Thursday of manslaughter for the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, whom the former Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, police officer shot during a traffic stop in April when she claimed she thought she was using her taser.
After deliberating for three days, jurors found Potter guilty of first-degree manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter. 
Over the course of the week and a half trial, prosecutors did not dispute that the shooting was an accident, but argued Potter’s training and experience should have prevented the mix-up and subsequent shooting, contending..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Wednesday that voters in the state of North Carolina should vote twice in the November election, once by vote and once by mail, to make sure their vote was counted.
“So, let them send it in and let them go vote,” Trump said in an interview with WECT-TV in Wilmington, North Carolina, when asked about the security of mail-in votes. “And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won’t be able to vote” in person.

"President Trump on Friday approved the deployment of U.S. troops and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) in response to an attack on Saudi oil facilities that the Trump administration has blamed on Iran.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper made the announcement at the Pentagon, saying “all indications are that Iran was responsible for the attack” on the two Saudi oil refineries, which were hit by drones and cruise missiles last weekend.
Saudi Arabia as well as its neighbor the UAE have since requested international support..."
"Law enforcement officers far outnumbered protesters at state capitol grounds on Sunday, as few Trump supporters who believe the president’s false claim that he won the 2020 election turned out for what authorities feared could be violent demonstrations. More than a dozen states activated National Guard troops to help secure their capitol buildings following an FBI warning of armed demonstrations, with right-wing extremists emboldened by the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6.
Security officials had eyed Sunday as the first major flashpoint, as that is..."
"Germany's national and regional leaders have agreed to bar unvaccinated people from much of public life in a bid to fend off a fourth wave of Covid-19.
Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel described the far-reaching measures as an act of ""national solidarity"".
Only those who have been vaccinated or recently recovered from Covid will be allowed in restaurants, cinemas, leisure facilities and many shops.
Vaccinations could be made mandatory by February, the chancellor added.
Germany's fourth wave of Covid is its most severe so far, with another 388 deaths recorded in..."
"President Joe Biden’s administration plans to rescind a rule devised under his predecessor Donald Trump that was intended to make it easier for healthcare providers including doctors and nurses to avoid performing abortions or other medical services on religious or moral grounds, Politico reported on Tuesday.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2018 unveiled what it called the “conscience rule,” but it never took effect due to litigation. States including California and New York and abortion providers filed suit to challenge it, leading a federal court..."
"Russian forces shelled the Azovstal steel plant soon after some civilians were evacuated from the besieged facility, Ukrainian military officials said ahead of fresh evacuations planned for Ukraine's final stronghold in Mariupol on Monday.
Details: Ukraine National Guard brigade commander Denys Shlega said in a TV address Sunday night that ""as soon as the last civilian"" from the group of evacuees left the plant it ""came under fire again"" as several hundred remaining civilians were sheltering, including up to 20 children, per Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said about 100 civilians were..."
"The second sign-up season under President Barack Obama's health overhaul opened Saturday, with hopes that this time consumers will have a positive experience.
But the fear is that entrenched political opposition and renewed legal challenges may yet collapse the program that's bringing health care to millions of previously uninsured Americans. The administration can't afford another technology meltdown.
With 7 million paying customers in new insurance markets, the Affordable Care Act has shown it is helping to reduce the number of uninsured. Insurers, not known for altruism, have stuck with the..."
"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar effectively pulled herself out of contention to be Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s running mate on Thursday, saying she felt that the historic moment required picking a woman of color.
“This is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket, and there are so many incredible qualified women,” she said in an interview on MSNBC. “If you want to heal this nation right now – my party, yes, but our nation – this is sure a hell of a way to..."
"Elon Musk’s legal team filed another notice on Tuesday to terminate his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, citing additional reasons.
Twitter shares were down more than 1% in premarket trade.
The latest filings come after Twitter’s former head of security, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, earlier this month alleged “extreme, egregious deficiencies” by the social media company related to privacy, security and content moderation.
On July 8, Musk’s legal team initially filed a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk’s team alleged that “Twitter has not complied with its..."
"The Department of Justice notified the Supreme Court on Wednesday that it no longer considers Obamacare to be unconstitutional, the latest reversal from the department since President Joe Biden was inaugurated in January.
The Supreme Court is considering a challenge to Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, brought by Texas and other Republican-led states. The Justice Department under former President Donald Trump backed Texas in legal briefs and during oral arguments in November.
California and other blue states are defending the law, under which 20 million Americans have..."
"President Joe Biden faces the unexpected task of quickly rewriting his policy agenda in a crucial election year after a key Senate Democrat abruptly rejected his signature $1.75 trillion economic plan.
Senator Joe Manchin stunned the White House and fellow Democrats Sunday by announcing his opposition to a tax-and-spending package tailored to win his support after months of courtship by Biden and other administration officials. The move effectively torpedoes Biden’s campaign promises to address climate change, health-care costs and child-care needs.
Losing support from Manchin, a moderate from West Virginia, is essentially fatal..."
"The family of a 28-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by a white police officer in her Fort Worth home as she played video games with her nephew expressed outrage Monday that the officer has not been arrested or fired.
The Fort Worth Police Department said officers responded about 2:25 a.m. Saturday after a neighbor called a non-emergency line to report the home's front door had been left open. The responding officer fired a shot through a window, killing Atatiana Jefferson.

"More than a dozen Russian oligarch-owned yachts have been moved to remote ports to try to avoid their seizure after Western nations sanctioned their owners.
Sanctions on the oligarchs have increased as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. Some of their vessels are being moved to or already are sitting in ports in other nations, according to the Associated Press.
While some oligarchs have already had their yachts seized, others are attempting to get their vessels out of the sanctioning countries' reach.
Several superyachts have been seized in the European Union so..."
"When Hillary Clinton was subjected to nearly 11 hours of intense cross-examination by Republican members of Congress during October's Benghazi committee hearing, she took the grilling. The members of that Republican-controlled committee did their best to be as ""unfair"" as possible and Clinton knew that going in.
What a contrast to Donald Trump, who said Tuesday he would bail on the Fox News-hosted GOP debate scheduled for Thursday because he feared that moderator Megyn Kelly wouldn't treat him fairly."
"Lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal for a third time on Friday, sounding its probable death knell and leaving Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union in turmoil on the very day it was supposed to quit the bloc.
The decision to reject a stripped-down version of May’s divorce deal has left it totally unclear how, when or even whether Britain will leave the EU, and plunges the three-year Brexit crisis to a deeper level of uncertainty.
“I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this..."
"A former member of Donald Trump's cabinet will attempt a return to the U.S. Congress in Montana and California Democrats concerned about crime may oust one of their own as voters head to the polls in midterm primary elections in seven states on Tuesday.
Voters in South Dakota, New Jersey, Iowa, Mississippi and New Mexico will also cast ballots in nominating contests that will set the competitive field for Nov. 8's elections, which will determine control of Congress for the next two years.
With President Joe Biden slumping in the..."
"A so-called ""trigger law"" that would go into effect in 30 days if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade would make performing abortion a felony in Texas.
Driving the news: According to a draft opinion obtained by Politico — which Axios cannot independently verify — the U.S. Supreme Court intends to overturn the landmark 1973 case, reversing five decades of constitutional protection for abortion."
"Governor Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Monday banning vaccine mandates by any company or person in the state of Texas.
The order states that ""no entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination by any individual, including an employee or consumer, who objects to such vaccination for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.""
Abbott sent a message to the Chief Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate, adding the item to the Third Special..."
"Federal money for state and local governments is a key sticking point to reviving negotiations over the next coronavirus relief package.
The White House and congressional Democrats are deeply divided over whether states should get more money — and if so, how much.
Before talks collapsed late last week, the two sides were hundreds of billions apart on how much they were willing to put on the table. Democrats want $915 billion, while Republicans are offering $150 billion, the same amount included in the CARES Act from late March.
There..."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) chief said on Thursday that there was a “premature push” to rule out the COVID-19 lab leak theory without enough evidence.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged to reporters during a briefing that the theory that COVID-19 originated from a lab is possible, in remarks that strayed from the WHO’s controversial report designating the hypothesis as “extremely unlikely.”
Tedros cited his experience as a lab technician and immunologist, saying that “lab accidents happen” and “it’s common,” so “checking what happened, especially in our labs,” is..."
"The top U.S. military officer is warning that the war in Ukraine will likely last years, raising concerns that the world ""is becoming more unstable and the potential for significant international conflict between great powers is increasing, not decreasing.""
During testimony in front of the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley called Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""the greatest threat to peace and security of Europe, and perhaps the world, in (his) 42 years of service in uniform.""
""The United States..."
"Negotiations continue among Democratic moderates and progressives over President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan, a sweeping proposal targeting “human infrastructure,” climate change and other party priorities.
Biden and other top Democrats had been aiming for a $3.5 trillion social-spending package that would move in tandem with a bipartisan infrastructure PAVE, +1.23% bill, but objections from moderates have shifted the White House to considering toplines ranging from $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion.
The president on Wednesday is scheduled to push his economic agenda in a speech in his birthplace of Scranton, Pa., amid reports that two key..."
"Many Americans see themselves as divided on immigration. Disagreements persist about family separation at the southern border, potential criminals entering the country illegally — and even how to describe people who enter the country without authorization.
But despite these perceived divisions, some recent surveys have found that many Republicans and Democrats share significant overlaps on immigration attitudes and policy issues.
Check out these surveys conducted since May 2020:
PRRI annual “American Values Survey” (survey published in October 2020)
76% of Americans opposed the family separation policy, including 91% of Democrats and..."
"Many of us taking part in the CNN town hall on guns have been touched by someone who chose to do evil.
I am sharing my thoughts with you because I feel I can relate to people on both sides of the issue of gun control. I have been afraid of guns, I have sworn I would never use a gun on another person and so did not need one, and I have wanted to deny the existence of evil"
"US President Donald Trump has said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an hour-long call, covering issues including the ""Russian hoax"".
""Had a long and very good conversation with President Putin,"" the US president tweeted.

"Across China, many medical workers are becoming overwhelmed—not by a wave of critically ill Covid-19 patients, but by a wave of not very sick ones.
Apart from a few weeks in early 2020 in the city of Wuhan, hospitals in China haven’t experienced the overflowing Covid wards other countries have had to get used to. Instead, in the country’s zeal to stamp out new infections as quickly as possible, the longstanding drill has been to hospitalize every Covid case and quarantine all “close contacts”—including doctors and nurses.
As Covid infections..."
"The Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance fund, which pays out retirement benefits, is on track to run out in 2031 as the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic takes its toll, according to a Wednesday report by the Congressional Budget Office.
Without congressional action to address the shortfalls, the depletion of the fund would lead to benefit cuts for retirees.
CBO projected that the OASI fund would drop from $2.8 trillion today to $533 billion in 2030, and run out the following year."
"Last week, I objected to Kamala Harris’s claim that Trump’s plan would cause Social Security checks to “stop coming.”
Now, the Biden campaign itself has a commercial, with Biden-approved text:
“The Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration just released an analysis of Trump’s planned cuts to Social Security. Under Trump’s plan, Social Security would become permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023. If Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just 3 years from now. Don’t let it happen. Joe Biden will protect..."
"As of this week, federal data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that 74.4% of the total population in the United States have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. While vaccination coverage has increased, it remains uneven across the country. Amid the current Omicron variant-related surge, unvaccinated people are at particularly increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death. As of January 10, 2022, White people accounted for the largest share (65%) of people who are unvaccinated.1 Over the course of the vaccination rollout, Black and..."

"President Trump reportedly intends to request $8.6 billion for his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico when he submits his 2020 congressional budget on Monday.
Reuters reported that the president will submit his request to Congress based on a 2017 plan crafted by Customs and Border Protection that called for 722 miles of barriers to be built or replaced along the U.S.-Mexico border.

"As I’m sure you’ve probably guessed, this passage seems like it could be about Donald Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination in 20161 — but it’s actually about Bernie Sanders’s quest for the Democratic nomination this year. It comes from an April 2019 feature by the Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere that I consider to be a lodestar for Sanders’s strategy since it contains a lot of on-the-record reporting from Sanders campaign.2
The article also reveals how the conventional wisdom about how primary campaigns have changed, in light of Trump winning..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave final approval Friday to start administering Covid-19 booster shots to Pfizer and Moderna vaccine recipients hours after a key panel unanimously voted to endorse third doses for immunocompromised Americans.

"Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Sunday that the Biden administration will punish Russian elites with sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine. 
During an appearance on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” Adeyemo told host Margaret Brennan that the sanctions would cut off elites from the markets they care about most.

The party line vote, 50-49, came just before 4 a.m., one day after the Senate passed a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. It is an initial victory for President Biden and congressional Democrats who are seeking to pass as much of their legislative agenda as possible this year, before next year’s midterm elections overtake Capitol..."
"Texan who narrowly lost Senate race in ’18 brings national profile, fund-raising clout to crowded contest
Former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke announced Thursday he is running for president, aiming to parlay his turn as one of the Democratic stars of the 2018 midterm elections into a run at his party’s nomination.
Mr. O’Rourke is the 15th Democrat to enter the contest. He joins the race as an instant first-tier candidate, commanding an online donor network second in size only to the one Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders carried over from his..."
"The Biden administration is extending the pause on federal student loan payments due to the coronavirus pandemic through Jan. 31, which the administration described as the final extension.
Student loan payments have been paused since Congress passed the CARES Act last year but were due to resume in September. During the pause, borrowers do not need to make payments and interest will not accrue on their remaining balance.
The Education Department described it as a “final extension of the pause” in the official announcement Friday afternoon. The administration said that the additional..."
"The most recent Supreme Court term ended with its conservative majority getting rid of major precedents — most notably Roe v. Wade — and setting new ones on religion and guns.
Driving the news: With a 6-3 majority, the next term — which is set to start in October — could be just as big. Here's a look at some of the most prominent cases the court has already agreed to hear.
Moore v. Harper
This case examines a legal theory that would grant state legislatures significantly more power over federal elections.

"The Republican National Committee and the Michigan Republican Party wrote to Michigan’s state board of canvassers on Saturday asking it to adjourn for 14 days to allow for an audit of ballots in the state’s largest county. A Michigan official said such an audit was not permitted under Michigan law.
The letter came as Wayne County, which includes the majority-Black city of Detroit, has become a focus of President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election in states that were decisive in his defeat by..."
"The Capitol Police officer who shot and killed Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt as a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 will not be disciplined after an internal investigation found no wrongdoing, the department said Monday.
A review “determined the officer’s conduct was lawful and within Department policy,” the Capitol Police said in a statement. The department said an officer can use deadly force if they “reasonably” believe it is “in the defense of human life” or “of any person in immediate danger of serious physical injury.”"
"Control of Congress still hangs in the balance as of Wednesday afternoon, as some competitive House contests remain uncalled and three Senate races are outstanding.
The big picture: Republicans are leading the race for control of the House, but a number of toss-ups are still up for grabs. The razor-thin battle for control of the Senate has winnowed to three key races — Arizona, Georgia and Nevada.
Georgia's high-profile contest between Republican Herschel Walker and incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is heading to a runoff, which will take place on Dec. 6, Republican Secretary of ..."
"New Hampshire lawmakers on Thursday voted to outlaw the death penalty in the Granite State, overriding a veto of a bill by Gov. Chris Sununu (R).
The new law, which takes effect immediately, means that capital punishment will be repealed throughout New England.
Veto overrides require a two-thirds majority, which the state Senate accomplished with its 16-8 vote on Thursday, according to The Associated Press. The state House voted to override the veto last week.
Sununu vetoed the bill repealing the death penalty earlier this month.
New Hampshire has not..."
"Former Vice President Walter Mondale, who was also the Democratic nominee for president in 1984, died on Monday at the age of 93.
Kathy Tunheim, a spokesperson for the family, confirmed the former vice president’s death in an email to The Hill. Axios first reported the news of Mondale’s death.
According to Tunheim, Mondale died peacefully of natural causes at his home in downtown Minneapolis at 7:21 p.m. while surrounded by his immediate family.
Prior to serving as vice president during former President Carter’s single term in the White House,..."
"President Joe Biden dismissed a “garbage” Wall Street Journal report from last week that alleged his administration was considering paying about $450,000 to each individual separated from their family at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that the purported plan to settle several lawsuits filed against the federal government on behalf of the immigrants was not under consideration.
After a Fox News reporter asked about the reported payments in a Wednesday press conference, Biden called the WSJ report that cited several anonymous sources “garbage” and “not true.”
Biden didn’t entirely deny that a settlement was in the works though, continuing, “$450,000 per..."
"President Barack Obama and his top aides believe they are putting in place a new global security structure that will frame international relations for decades.
Every day, however, brings a split-screen contrast between the White House's confidence in its long-term strategy and the daily chaos playing out from Ukraine to the Middle East.
The disconnect is reflected in the president's declining poll ratings. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released this week shows Americans' approval of his foreign-policy record at a new low of 36%."
"Chinese President Xi Jinping called for accelerating the building of a world-class military while touting the fight against COVID-19 as he kicked off a Communist Party Congress by focussing on security and reiterating policy priorities.
Xi, 69, is widely expected to win a third leadership term at the conclusion of the week-long congress that began on Sunday morning, cementing his place as China's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong.
Roughly 2,300 delegates from around the country gathered in the vast Great Hall of the People on the west side of..."
"The unthinkable has become horribly predictable.
On Tuesday afternoon, an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at a Texas elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, about 85 miles west of San Antonio, killing at least 19 children, two adults, and injuring others.
It was the deadliest shooting at a grade school in the U.S. since a 20-year-old gunman killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012.
Uvalde is located between San Antonio and the Southern border, and has a large Mexican-American population. The official site for the city..."
"The New York Times editorial board on Sunday night endorsed both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) for the Democratic nomination for president.
The dual endorsement, a break in convention for the Times, comes just two weeks before the first primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Warren has remained a top contender while Klobuchar has struggled to break out of single-digit support.
""In a break with convention, the editorial board has chosen to endorse two separate Democratic candidates for president,"" reads the Times's endorsement.

"Democrats will keep their House majority, NBC News projected Tuesday, as the major U.S. parties jockeyed for control of the White House and Senate in the 2020 election.
Democrats entered Election Day heavily favored to keep control of the chamber. Their hopes of expanding their advantage appeared to dim on election night, as some Democratic incumbents will lose and the party will fall short in picking up some of its top GOP-held targets, according to NBC News projections.
As of early Wednesday morning, NBC News estimated Democrats would hold 227..."
"Ever since we launched our election model in late June, it has moved entirely in one direction: toward Democrats. Pretty much every week, they’ve either gained ground in our forecast or held steady. 
This week has been more in the “held steady” category. In the Deluxe version of our model, Democrats’ chances of keeping the Senate are 71 percent, while their chances of holding the House are 31 percent. Neither number has meaningfully changed from a week ago.
As Democrats’ position has continually improved, I’ve tended to focus on optimistic..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) “unequivocally” on Thursday that he will only support a narrow budget reconciliation package before Labor Day if is does not include new spending to fight climate change or taxes on wealthy individuals or corporations, according to a Democrat briefed on the talks.
Manchin has informed Schumer that if Democrats move the reconciliation bill in August, he will only support a provision to lower prescription drug prices and a two-year extension of expiring health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to the..."
"With U.S.-China trade talks at an impasse, President Trump moved Friday to tackle festering trade disputes with U.S. allies and North American neighbors.
The White House released an order putting off a decision on proposed tariffs on imported cars and auto parts for about six months, giving the administration room to negotiate possible trade deals with the European Union and Japan.
Hours later, Mr. Trump said the U.S. had reached a deal to exempt Canada and Mexico from tariffs on steel and aluminum that were imposed last year...."
"The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation rose a sharp 0.9% in March, but the increase largely stemmed from a surge in the cost of gas and there were some signs that intense price pressures could be starting to ease.
Over the past 12 months, the personal consumption price index has climbed 6.6%, up from 6.4% in February, the government said Friday. That’s the steepest increase since 1981.
Yet a narrower measure of inflation that omits volatile food and energy costs, known as the core PCE, rose by just 0.3% in..."
"New York City officials estimated that more than 4,000 immigrants seeking asylum have arrived in the city from Texas, including busloads of immigrants who are at the center of a political showdown initiated by Gov. Greg Abbott.
As part of what has been dubbed Operation Lone Star, Abbott included New York alongside Washington, D.C. as destination cities for chartered buses filled with asylum-seeking immigrants, many of whom are attempting to reach other cities. Democrats, including those from the targeted cities, have described the initiative as a dangerous political stunt.

"Kanye West gave an explosive interview to right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson on Thursday night and the rapper revealed his ties to three political families—the Trumps, the Kushners and the Clintons.
The rapper and fashion designer—who has legally changed his name to Ye—has been embroiled in yet more controversy this week after promoting a White Lives Matter T-shirt at Paris Fashion Week.
The bombshell interview saw the Donda hitmaker discuss everything from politics to family, to abortion, Lizzo's weight and his divorce from Kim Kardashian."
"The release of thousands of emails to and from U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci has fueled claims that the virus behind COVID-19 was man-made. BuzzFeed and The Washington Post received the emails in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, and both published articles on June 1.
Fauci’s critics quickly responded.
“Dr Fauci exposed for the fraud he is,” said a June 2 Facebook post from the WTF Files. “Fauci’s fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.”"
"A federal judge in Florida on Monday declared that the Biden administration’s Covid-19 mask mandate for public transportation is unlawful, invalidating a regulation that required travelers in the U.S. to wear masks on airplanes, trains, taxis, buses and other forms of public transit.
U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa said the mandate exceeded the authority granted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under federal public health law.
Judge Mizelle, a President Donald Trump appointee, said Congress had never clearly given the CDC the power to issue population-wide preventive..."
"Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s political future had long been in jeopardy. From voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to repeatedly refuting his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Cheney has been one of Trump’s harshest critics. Now that outspokenness has come with a price.
The daughter of one of America’s most powerful vice presidents lost to her main primary challenger, attorney Harriet Hageman, by around 20 points, based on incomplete returns as of 10:30 p.m. Eastern. Hageman’s path to victory was pretty straightforward. She entered..."
"Republicans are gearing up for a handful of hotly contested primaries on Tuesday in Georgia, where GOP voters appear poised to buck former President Trump and his endorsed candidate in the state’s primary for governor.
But Tuesday’s primaries — which will additionally take place in Alabama and Arkansas, along with a key runoff in Texas — also carries stakes for progressives and Republicans who broke with Trump over his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. 
Here are five things to watch in the May 24 primaries.

"Federal prosecutors unsealed charges on Wednesday against five Chinese citizens that officials say appear linked to Chinese intelligence, accusing them of hacking more than 100 companies in the U.S. and overseas, including social-media firms, universities and telecommunications providers.
Two Malaysian businessmen were arrested Monday in Malaysia and accused of conspiring with some of the Chinese hackers to profit from intrusions into the videogame industry, Justice Department officials said.
The charges, laid out in three separate indictments, build on several other cases brought against accused Chinese hackers during the Trump administration,..."
"Vaccines appear to be starting to curb new Covid-19 infections in the U.S., a breakthrough that could help people return to more normal activities as infection worries fade, public-health officials say.
By Tuesday, 37.3% of U.S. adults were fully vaccinated against Covid-19, with about 2.7 million shots each day. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average for new U.S. cases has fallen below the 14-day average for more than a week, which epidemiologists said is a strong signal that cases are starting to slide again after a recent..."
"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised benchmark interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point and indicated it will keep hiking well above the current level.
In its quest to bring down inflation running near its highest levels since the early 1980s, the central bank took its federal funds rate up to a range of 3%-3.25%, the highest it has been since early 2008, following the third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move.
Stocks had given up earlier gains after the announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 200..."
"President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are competing for voters in battleground states that will likely sway the November election: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
All those states — some historically favorable for Democrats — voted for Trump in 2016 over then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had voted consistently for Democratic presidential candidates from 1992 to 2012, with Trump being the first Republican to break the streak of blue wins in those states with narrow victories.

"Worried that some members of the Republican establishment are getting used to the idea that Donald Trump might win the party’s presidential nomination, the venerable National Review has just published an extraordinary anti-Trump screed.
The magazine – founded by legendary New York conservative William F. Buckley – follows its own tough Trump editorial with submissions from 22 right-leaning thought leaders on the subject of why the reality star/real estate mogul shouldn’t be entrusted with the reins of American power.
Why such concerted opposition? The magazine’s central problem with Mr. Trump..."
"The president’s personal pilot is on the administration's short list to head the Federal Aviation Administration. Trump has told a host of administration officials and associates that he wants John Dunkin — his longtime personal pilot, who flew him around the country on Trump Force One during the campaign — to helm the agency, which has a budget in the billions and which oversees all civil aviation in the United States."
"U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss is facing calls to resign from within her own Conservative Party just six weeks after entering Downing Street.
Truss and her former Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng announced a fiscal package – a so-called mini-budget – on Sept. 23. The measures triggered market turmoil, from a plunging pound to pension panic, and a rare public rebuke by the International Monetary Fund.
Piece by piece, the plans have been tweaked and trashed – including reversing plans to scrap an increase in the corporation tax, axing plans to abolish the top income tax bracket, and shortening..."

"The COVID-19 booster drive in the U.S. is losing steam, worrying health experts who have pleaded with Americans to get an extra shot to shore up their protection against the highly contagious Omicron variant.
Just 40% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the average number of booster shots dispensed per day in the U.S. has plummeted from a peak of 1 million in early December to about 490,000 as of last week.

"There is a growing bipartisan feeling that something has gone wrong in America. We may have been heading toward it for a long time before the 2016 race and paid no attention. But now America is in crisis. It can be seen in the headlines of opinion writers this week in The Washington Post. From the right, Robert Kagan says, ""There is something very wrong with Donald Trump."" On the left, Eugene Robinson asks, ""Is Donald Trump just plain crazy?"""
"Senate Democrats unveiled a bill on Wednesday to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.
Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act on Wednesday after Schumer previously teased the plan on April 20.
The bill is designed to decriminalize marijuana on the federal level, expunge federal convictions for nonviolent marijuana crimes, allow those imprisoned for marijuana to petition their sentencing, take marijuana off the federal list of controlled substances and create a tax system for the substance.

"When are we going to know the results of the midterms? In 2020, due to slow vote counting in many states, it took days — until Saturday, Nov. 7 — for ABC News to declare Joe Biden the president-elect. We likely won’t have to wait that long this year, but it is again possible that we won’t know the winners of the 2022 election on election night. States like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania that are key to Senate control could take multiple days to count all their votes.

"Progressive allies of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) are rushing to her defense as the House prepares to approve a resolution condemning anti-Semitism that is largely seen as a rebuke of the outspoken lawmaker’s remarks about Israel.
Omar’s progressive allies largely stayed quiet during other recent controversies regarding Israel, which led to an apology from Omar.
But this time, Omar is holding her ground, and supporters such as fellow progressive freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are speaking out.
Ocasio-Cortez said advancing a resolution to rebuke Omar should have only been done..."
"Chamath Palihapitiya, an owner of the Golden State Warriors NBA basketball team, came under fire following his recent remarks expressing strong doubts about reports of human rights violations against Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang region.
The comments by Palihapitiya—who reportedly owns two percent of the NBA franchise, according to the New York Post—is the latest among recent controversies that have compromised the NBA's relationship with China, with whom the franchise has garnered billion-dollar deals.
During an episode of his All-In podcast, which aired Saturday, Palihapitiya and his co-hosts began a debate about the Joe Biden administration's stance on Beijing's treatment..."
"House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday introduced legislation that would block the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) from implementing a series of changes amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Delivering for America Act would prevent USPS from instituting shifts to its operations or to the level of service that was in place at the beginning of 2020.
The bill comes as Maloney and other Democrats increasingly speak out against the decisions made at USPS during a year in which the presidential election will rely more heavily..."
"Stewart Rhodes, a founder and leader of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, has been arrested and charged in connection with events leading up to and including the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the Justice Department announced Thursday.
Why it matters: Rhodes is the most prominent figure arrested on charges related to the Capitol insurrection.
State of play: Rhodes, along with 10 other defendants, was charged with seditious conspiracy.
The indictment alleges that following the 2020 presidential election, Rhodes ""conspired with his co-defendants and others to oppose by force the execution of the laws governing the..."

Well, he’s a retired lawyer now, but he was all cop when I met him. And as a young reporter at the time, I learned a great deal from this police supervisor and SWAT team commander that would prove useful in my career as a journalist.

"House speaker says such a move would be too divisive.
WASHINGTON—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she doesn’t support pursuing the impeachment of President Trump, saying such a step would be too divisive and the Democratic Party should focus instead on winning back the White House in 2020.
“I’m not for impeachment,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a Washington Post interview published Monday. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path."""

"US President Joe Biden has warned there is a ""distinct possibility"" Russia might invade Ukraine next month, the White House says.
Russia meanwhile says it sees ""little ground for optimism"" in resolving the crisis after the US rejected Russia's main demands.

"The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its sweeping vaccine-or-test requirements for large private companies, but allowed a vaccine mandate to stand for medical facilities that take Medicare or Medicaid payments.
The rulings came three days after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s emergency measure for businesses started to take effect.
The mandate required that workers at businesses with 100 or more employees get vaccinated or submit a negative Covid test weekly to enter the workplace. It also required unvaccinated workers to wear masks indoors at work...."
"A group of top Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour over five years.
Why it matters: The policy, which has widespread support among Democratic lawmakers, aligns with what President Joe Biden has called for in his emergency COVID-19 relief package. It would more than double the current minimum wage of $7.25.
Congress has not increased the federal minimum wage in more than a decade.
The state of play: The bill — sponsored by House Committee on Education and Labor..."

"After claiming credit for killing Qassem Soleimani outside Baghdad International Airport, Donald Trump said that the world was now a “safer place.” This viewpoint was perhaps understandable, given Soleimani’s position as the commander of Iran’s Quds Force and his role in developing the Badr Organization in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, and the Houthi movement in Yemen, among numerous other fighting outfits around the world. At the heart of this sprawling violent network stood Soleimani. Not for nothing, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called him “a living martyr of the revolution.”..."

"Frederick Douglass, with typical historical foresight, outlined a solution to the current impasse over a statue he dedicated in Washington, D.C., in 1876. Erected a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol, in a square called Lincoln Park, the so-called Emancipation Memorial depicts Abraham Lincoln standing beside a formerly enslaved African-American man in broken shackles, down on one knee—rising or crouching, depending on who you ask. As the nation continues to debate the meaning of monuments and memorials, and as local governments and protesters alike take them down, the Lincoln Park..."

Some bans will take effect immediately and others in the weeks and months ahead.
South Dakota, Louisiana and Kentucky have “trigger” bans in place to immediately outlaw abortion once Roe is overturned. Penalties for people who provide or attempt to provide..."
"The Commerce Department's initial estimate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter was, in a word, historic. The value of all goods and services purchased last quarter plunged at a 32.9% annual rate. This followed a 5% contraction in the first quarter of 2020.
The BEA offered the following assessment of this decline in GDP:

"Prices that consumers pay for a variety of goods and services rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, a slowing pace from the previous month due largely to a drop in gasoline prices.
On a monthly basis, prices were flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.
Excluding volatile food and..."
"North Korea carried out another banned missile test, just hours after a visit by US Vice-President Kamala Harris, South Korea's military says.
Two short-range ballistic missiles were fired into the sea off the North's east coast, it said, in the third such breach of UN sanctions this week.
It follows a visit by Ms Harris to the demilitarised zone dividing the Koreas.
This has been a record year for missile tests in North Korea and the latest launches are timed to send a message.
They come as the US and..."
"President Donald Trump on Friday said he would not fire White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, even though a government watchdog found she had violated U.S. law by making political statements in her official role and called for her ouster.
Trump, in an interview with Fox News, defended Conway, saying it was a free speech issue.
“She’s got to have the right of responding to questions. It really sounds to me like a free speech thing. It doesn’t sound fair,” the Republican president said.
On Thursday, the Office of Special Counsel..."
"Jordan executed two convicted terrorists early Wednesday, hours after Islamic State jihadists released a video purporting to show them burning alive a captured Jordanian air-force pilot.
The death of the pilot, First Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh, had spurred promises Tuesday evening of a severe response from Jordan, but execution of the two prisoners in the early hours of Wednesday came with unexpected swiftness. It was a dramatic tit-for-tat in the fight against Islamic State militants who have killed numerous high-profile hostages as they have spread across Iraq and Syria since last..."
"Democratic leaders are racing to keep the impeachment genie in its bottle.
The release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s mammoth report on Russia’s 2016 election meddling revealed a trove of details related to President Trump’s handling of the investigation, lending a new boost to the small but vocal group of Democrats pushing to oust the president — and creating new challenges for party leaders advocating a more deliberative approach.
In a conference call with House Democrats on Monday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other party leaders sought to rein..."
"President-elect Joe Biden called President Trump’s refusal to concede the election an “embarrassment” on Tuesday and warned that failing to do so would reflect poorly on his legacy in office.
“I just think it’s an embarrassment, quite frankly,” Biden said, when asked to comment on Trump’s refusal to acknowledge defeat in last week’s presidential election.
“The only thing that — how can I say this tactfully — I think it will not help the president’s legacy,” Biden, seemingly choosing his words carefully, added."
"Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) stunned fellow Democrats on Sunday by announcing he would not vote for President Biden’s ambitious climate and social spending bill, which his allies saw as the crowning legislative achievement of his first term.
Biden’s plans to address global warming and wealth inequality will now have to be substantially reworked if they are to become law, with many of his policy proposals potentially shelved in order to get Manchin’s vote.
Manchin’s warning Sunday that the Build Back Better bill would fuel inflation and risk American energy independence means that Democrats..."
"Consumer prices jumped more than expected in May, but the surge in inflation looks to be temporary and should not push the Federal Reserve to tighten policy for now.
The consumer price index rose 5% in May on a year-over-year basis, the highest since the summer of 2008, when oil prices were skyrocketing. Excluding food and energy, core CPI rose 3.8% year over year, the highest pace since 1992. A third of the increase was attributed to a sharp 7.3% increase in used car and truck prices.
Fed officials have described..."
"President Trump on Monday demanded that the anonymous whistleblower who raised an alarm about his contacts with Ukraine testify.
Trump said it was “not acceptable” for the whistleblower to answer written questions from Republican lawmakers in connection with the House impeachment inquiry, as his attorneys communicated was on the table on Sunday. And he claimed without evidence that the whistleblower gave “false information.”
The president also referenced revelations that the whistleblower contacted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s (D-Calif.) committee for guidance before filing the complaint, calling the top Democrat..."
"The Supreme Court sidestepped major abortion cases Tuesday, letting stand a lower-court ruling that Indiana cannot ban abortions for the purpose of sex, race or disability selection but allowing the state to regulate the disposal of fetal remains.
The court’s unsigned opinion appeared the product of a delicate compromise, and it stressed the justices weren’t ready—for now—to consider whether either law violates the Constitution. Instead, the three-page opinion offered procedural reasons for the different, if perhaps temporary, outcomes in both cases.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,..."
"Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.
sarah (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): It’s possible that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion, is about to be overturned.
Late on Monday, Politico published a draft Supreme Court opinion that indicates a majority of the court’s conservative justices are ready to overturn Roe. There’s still a lot we don’t know at this point, including whether this opinion has changed — the draft Politico obtained is dated Feb. 10, and Supreme Court opinions often involve..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China threatened retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday calling for sanctions over the repression of China’s Uighurs, as excerpts from a book by his former national security adviser alleged he had approved of their mass detention.
The bill, which Congress passed with only one “no” vote, was intended to send China a strong message on human rights by mandating sanctions against those responsible for oppression of members of China’s Muslim minority.
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci announced Monday that he will resign as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) after spending more than a half-century in government, prompting Republican detractors to question his timing following his perceived double-talk during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In December, Fauci will also forfeit his roles as chief of the NIAID Laboratory of Immunoregulation and President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, saying he wants ""to pursue the next chapter of my career."" Republicans believe Fauci is leaving government due to the possibility that the GOP will take control of the..."
"The husband of Lori Klausutis, an aide to Joe Scarborough when he was a member of Congress who died in 2001, asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take down President Trump's tweets baselessly accusing the MSNBC host of murdering her, according to a letter obtained by the New York Times' Kara Swisher.
The state of play: Timothy Klausutis asked Dorsey to delete the tweets because Trump ""has taken something that does not belong him — the memory of my dead wife and perverted it for perceived political gain."""
"President Joe Biden will speak to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on April 28, accepting an invitation from House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow Democrat.
“The President has accepted the invitation of the Speaker of the House to address a Joint Session of Congress on April 28, the night before his 100th day in office,” the White House said in a prepared statement.
The speech will give Biden, 78, an opportunity to deliver a sales pitch to millions of Americans for his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal,..."
"Queen Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch and the nation's figurehead for seven decades, died on Thursday aged 96.
Here is some reaction to her death:
U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL ANTONIO GUTERRES
""As the United Kingdom's longest-lived and longest-reigning Head of State, Queen Elizabeth II was widely admired for her grace, dignity, and dedication around the world. She was a reassuring presence throughout decades of sweeping change, including the decolonization of Africa and Asia and the evolution of the Commonwealth.""

"The US National Security Agency (NSA) has hit back at allegations by Fox News host Tucker Carlson that it is spying on him to force him off air.
On Monday Carlson, a long-time critic of President Joe Biden, said a government whistle-blower had told him the NSA was monitoring him for ""political reasons"".
The NSA denied he was a ""target"", saying it deals with foreign threats.
Fox News has not commented publicly on its host's claim.
In response to a question about Carlson's comments, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said..."
"A White House official testified in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump on Tuesday that the president’s phone call urging Ukraine’s leader to investigate Trump’s political rivals was improper and blasted what he called “cowardly” attacks on witnesses in the investigation.
Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the White House National Security Council’s top Ukraine expert, testified at the third public hearing in the impeachment effort before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.
Vindman, who along with other witnesses has been publicly criticized by Trump, also told lawmakers that “vile..."
"Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao reportedly still owns stock in a construction company that she previously promised to divest from upon taking office.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that federal disclosure forms show Chao to be the owner of nearly $400,000 worth of stock in Vulcan Materials Co., a major supplier of materials for road pavement and other construction projects, more than a year after she promised to trade the shares for a cash payout.
The cash payout has yet to occur, the Journal reported. A spokesman for the Department..."
"Elon Musk regrets his agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion. And now, he’s officially trying to get out of the deal.
In a letter to Twitter (pdf) on July 8, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Musk’s lawyers said that Musk is terminating the takeover agreement with Twitter because, they allege, Twitter made “false and misleading” statements about its user data.
Musk, who agreed to buy Twitter on April 25, has since expressed concern with what percentage of Twitter’s monetizable daily active users (mDAU), a metric reported quarterly to the..."
"No one really wants this job, but millions of households may need their own Thanksgiving bouncer. The cover charge is a negative COVID test, done ahead of arrival or outside the front door.
Why it matters: Normalizing rapid tests is a practical way to help extended families feel a little more normal around the holiday dinner table.
You may have relatives who aren't vaccinated (or won't say) — or babies or immunocompromised guests who are vulnerable to breakthrough infections.
How it works: If you're hosting, let your guests know ahead of their..."
"Retailers, who took a financial hit because of the coronavirus pandemic and its associated shutdowns, are setting their sights on Black Friday, cautiously hopeful for a day of improved sales.
Businesses are looking to the usual busiest shopping day of the year to boost low sales. But this Black Friday is expected to see more online purchases amid the coronavirus pandemic rather than millions of in-person shoppers.
Many businesses broke from recent years’ traditions of staying open on Thanksgiving and starting Black Friday sales early and instead increased safety..."
"Gross domestic product unexpectedly declined at a 1.4% annualized pace in the first quarter, marking an abrupt reversal for an economy coming off its best performance since 1984, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
The negative growth rate missed even the subdued Dow Jones estimate of a 1% gain for the quarter. GDP measures the output of goods and services in the U.S. for the three-month period.
A plethora of factors conspired to weigh against growth during the first three months of 2022, which fell off a cliff following the 6.9%..."
"Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice (N.Y.) announced Tuesday she will retire at the end of her current term, becoming the 30th House member from her party to plan on leaving the chamber after this year.
Rice, a former prosecutor and district attorney, said in a statement on her 57th birthday that it has been an “honor” to serve in public office but that elected officials “must give all we have and then know when it is time to allow others to serve.”
“Though I will not be running for re-election to Congress this year, I will remain..."
"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sidelined his childhood friend as head of Ukraine's security service, and another close ally as top prosecutor, in Kyiv's biggest internal purge of the war, citing their failure to root out Russian spies.
The careers of SBU security service chief Ivan Bakanov and Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova had personified Zelenskiy's policy of putting young loyalists in charge of fighting corruption since the former TV comic came to power in 2019.
But nearly five months after Russia's invasion, the president acknowledged that his two allies had failed to..."
"Alabama schools reported 13,000 coronavirus cases in a two-week period on Friday, according to data from the Alabama Department of Public Health and the Alabama State Department of Education.
The data shows a total of 9,195 cases were recorded this week in schools across the state, and 4,337 cases reported in the previous week. 
The number could be higher, because only 84 of the 143 school districts have reported their data, according to the dashboard. 
Alabama does not have a statewide school mask mandate in place, but 90 percent of schools have chosen to..."
"At least 12 major U.S. cities have set homicide records this year, including topping five set just last year, ABC News reports.
The big picture: Experts cite fewer cops on the streets, reduced after-school and nonviolence programs, court systems that can't handle the strain, and mental health issues exacerbated by two years of COVID.
""[I]t's worse than a war zone around here lately,"" Rochester Police Capt. Frank Umbrino said after the city set a new all-time high on Nov. 11.
The bottom line: Minneapolis and Milwaukee are close to becoming Nos. 13 and 14..."
"President Joe Biden said Friday that he is convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. 
""As of this moment, I am convinced he has made the decision. We have reason to believe that,"" Biden said at the White House. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv.” The president cited U.S. intelligence but providing no details to support his assertion. Biden said diplomacy remains open to prevent war until Putin actually begins an attack. "
"At a state convention in Houston, nearly 5,000 Texas GOP delegates on Saturday ""overwhelmingly passed a resolution questioning the 2020 election,"" the party announced.
What they're saying: ""We reject the certified results of the 2020 Presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was not legitimately elected,"" the resolution says.
The big picture: The Platform Committee's final report has a ""State Sovereignty"" section declaring: ""Texas retains the right to secede from the United States.""
A ""Texas Independence"" section calls for the legislature to hold a statewide 2023 referendum ""to determine whether or..."
"The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits continued to surge at record levels, bringing the total number of applications to nearly 17 million since the coronavirus pandemic shut down swaths of the U.S. economy.
The Labor Department reported Thursday that another 6.6 million people submitted applications for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 4. That is on top of a revised 6.9 million in the prior week, a record, and 3.3 million the week before.
Another key measurement of joblessness showed a record 7.5 million Americans were receiving unemployment..."
"A broad breakdown in law enforcement intelligence and communication before and during the Capitol riot in January has been set out in a US Senate report.
It found intelligence was not passed on to police and officers lacked command, as supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the building.
Five people died after Congress in Washington was invaded as it tried to validate Joe Biden's election victory.
The report does not discuss the role of the Republican president in the riot."
"Anew Israeli government has been sworn in. This new government does not include former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his Likud Party, which has ruled Israel with few exceptions for the last 44 years. And both Bibi's supporters and his opponents will need to adjust to a whole new world in which, to paraphrase President Richard Nixon, they won't have Netanyahu to kick around anymore.
The question remains as to how long this new world will exist. Many pundits predict a quick demise of the new government. The ideological differences within this..."
"The world on the brink of 2022 seems an especially unpredictable, and unsettling, place. For the first time, two FT forecasts this year ask if Russia and China will invade neighbours (we say no, but that may be wishful thinking). Less optimistically, our forecasters warn a more infectious coronavirus variant than Omicron could yet emerge, inflation will not return to US targets, tighter monetary policy will hit equities, and the next global climate conference will still not achieve enough in limiting warming. A bit playfully, perhaps, John Thornhill forecasts shares..."
"Last week we learned that housing prices grew rapidly yet again in January.
The widely followed S&P CoreLogic 20-City Home Price Index was up 19.1% compared with January of last year — a blistering pace, especially considering that the growth was on top of the 11%-plus growth rate reported for January 2021.
It’s highly anomalous for housing prices to rise over 32% in a span of two years, and so the trend is causing some economists to start worrying about a possible bubble."
"President Joe Biden on Tuesday once again pushed for all eligible Americans to get Covid vaccinations, stressing the importance of being protected against the highly transmissible delta variant.
Despite the U.S. being on track to hit 160 million people fully vaccinated in the coming days, Biden said, millions remain unvaccinated against Covid, “and because of that, their communities are at risk, their friends are at risk, the people they care about are at risk.”
“This is an even bigger concern because of the delta variant,” the president said."
"Twenty years ago, we witnessed a defining moment in American and world history. The terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 changed a generation and shaped our world like few events ever have, or ever will. With the passing of time, a new generation forges ahead and creates their own future while we commemorate the victims and struggle with the lessons of our past. The world has now watched as the war which the attacks started has come to an ignominious end. And those of us who lived through that day..."
"House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) on Tuesday said he supports House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), following revelations that the Louisianian addressed a white nationalist group in 2002.
“More than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate,” Mr. Boehner said. “Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character. He has my full confidence as our whip, and he..."
"Solar stocks jumped on Thursday after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., said they’ve reached a deal on what would be the most ambitious climate spending package in U.S. history.
The “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” includes $369 billion for clean energy provisions
“The entire clean energy industry just breathed an enormous sigh of relief,” American Clean Power CEO Heather Zichal said Wednesday evening.
“This is an 11th hour reprieve for climate action and clean energy jobs, and America’s biggest legislative moment for climate and energy policy,” she added.

"A white father and son convicted of killing a black jogger have been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
In November, a jury found Travis and Gregory McMichael and their neighbour, William Bryan, guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery in February 2020.
Bryan also received the maximum penalty of life, but was offered the possibility of parole in 30 years.
The judge said the McMichaels had not shown remorse or empathy for Arbery.
Judge Timothy Walmsley said he gave them severe sentences in part because of their..."
"A defiant Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia's annexation of a swathe of Ukraine in a pomp-filled Kremlin ceremony, promising Moscow would triumph in its ""special military operation"" against Kyiv even as some of his troops faced potential defeat.
The Russian president's proclamation of Russian rule over 15% of Ukraine - the biggest annexation in Europe since World War Two - was roundly rejected by Western countries, with the United States and Britain announcing new sanctions.
It comes as Russian forces in one of the four regions being annexed face being encircled..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, launched his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Wednesday, presenting competition from the political left to front-runner Hillary Clinton.
“This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Sanders will email supporters early Thursday, according to a preview offered by his campaign. “It’s about a grass-roots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ‘Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.’”
On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders declared his candidacy to the Associated..."
"In order to tackle the spread of COVID in the U.S., President Joe Biden made a U-turn on mandatory vaccination on Thursday when he announced that all federal employees must be vaccinated over the coming months or their jobs may be at risk.
The mandate could potentially affect up to 100 million Americans. Employers with more than 100 employees must ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly, while federal contractors must be vaccinated. The move reflects measures employed in California and New York.
The U.S. is no stranger to protecting the health..."
"Warner Bros. Discovery is shutting down CNN+ as of April 30, marking one of the company’s first significant maneuvers since completing the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery less than two weeks ago.
The decision puts an abrupt end to an ambitious and aggressive venture that people familiar with the matter say rankled David Zaslav, the new CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, from the start. Zaslav was annoyed by the decision of Jason Kilar, the former CEO of WarnerMedia when it was owned by AT&T, to launch CNN+ just weeks before Discovery was..."
"Facebook expanded a ban on QAnon-related content on its various social platforms Tuesday, deepening a previous prohibition on QAnon-related groups that had “discussed potential violence,” according to the company.
Today’s move by Facebook to not only ban violent QAnon content but “any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon” is an escalation by the social giant to clean its platform ahead of an increasingly contentious election.
QAnon is a sprawling set of interwoven pro-Trump conspiracy theories that has taken root inside swaths of the American electorate. Its more extreme..."

"The stock market is generally expected to benefit from inflation, but a long-predicted surge in U.S. prices rattled investors in the past week. A closer look at the historical record might indicate the source of concern, according to one Wall Street analyst.
For equities, there is “good” inflation and “bad” inflation, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a Thursday note. Good inflation lifts corporate earnings as long as employment remains high; bad inflation causes recessions, undercutting corporate earnings.
“Markets are volatile because they’re not sure which sort of..."
"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars in federal law enforcement grants from sanctuary cities and states that don't cooperate with immigration enforcement, AP reports.
The state of play: Seven states and New York City sued the U.S. government after the Justice Department said in 2017 it would withhold funds from cities and states that don't give immigration enforcement officials access to jails or notice when an undocumented migrant is scheduled to be released from jail, per AP.

"The International Energy Agency has called for member countries to adopt “emergency measures” to cut oil demand in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including driving restrictions, lower speed limits and curbs on air travel.
Fatih Birol, head of the energy watchdog, on Friday warned that such steps might be necessary because “oil markets are in an emergency situation . . . and it may get worse”.
As much as 2.5mn barrels a day of Russian oil exports could cease from next month due to the impact of the war and consumer..."
"Republicans Ted Cruz and John Kasich visit Orthodox Brooklyn neighborhoods; Bernie Sanders faces criticism over remarks on Israel. It was a sight that even those anticipating a competitive New York presidential primary on Tuesday hadn’t expected to witness: Republican candidate Ted Cruz in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn belting out “Dayenu,” the traditional Passover Seder song.
With New York’s many delegates in play this year, candidates from both parties have sought to court Jewish voters, a population known for its high turnout. New York contains the largest concentration of..."
"A trial over whether a lawyer with ties to the Democratic Party lied to the FBI in 2016 is set to begin on Monday in what could be the first major test for John Durham, the special counsel appointed during the Trump administration to investigate the former president’s allegations of a conspiracy to undermine his campaign. 
Michael Sussmann, a former partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, is charged with making false statements to the FBI’s top lawyer during the 2016 campaign when he handed over data to the bureau purporting..."
"No matter how one reads the diplomatic deal announced Thursday between Israel and the United Arab Emirates­—and there will surely be many supporters and detractors given its historic nature—there is one conclusion that seems irrefutable: Israel was the biggest victor.
Israel, and specifically its embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has scored a huge victory. In suspending threats to annex parts of the West Bank in return for full normalization of relations with the UAE, he has given himself room to back away from a promise that may have been popular..."
"President Trump on Friday declared it a ""great day for equality"" and a ""great day"" for George Floyd following a jobs report that showed unemployment falling, except for African Americans, and days of unrest sparked by Floyd's death.
The president delivered lengthy and often rambling remarks in the Rose Garden that were ostensibly meant to highlight a new jobs report that showed unemployment falling after weeks of the country being shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic.
But Trump veered frequently from topic to topic, at times addressing the nationwide protests spurred..."
"President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus took an even sharper political turn on Tuesday after he seized upon the crisis in a controversial move to suspend immigration, and as he planned to meet with the governor of New York, the hardest hit state.
Trump is also seizing the moment to launch a sweeping effort to repeal or suspend federal business regulations in a separate executive action, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing two unnamed people familiar with the planning.
The developments came as Trump planned to meet on..."
"United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)have canceled hundreds of Christmas Eve flights, as the spreading COVID-19 Omicron variant takes a toll on its flight crews and other workers.
Chicago-based United on Thursday canceled 120 flights for Friday, while Atlanta-based Delta said it had canceled about 90. Both said they were working to contact passengers so they would not be stranded at airports.
FlightAware on Friday said United has now canceled 169 flights on Christmas Eve and Delta has canceled 127, along with another 50 canceled flights for United on Christmas..."
"President Trump on Monday hammered the media after the New York Times issued a correction to a report that included a sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a trio of tweets, the president lashed out at the media over the reports, saying that The Times “should be sued” after the news outlet released a correction that noted that friends of the woman allegedly involved in the incident with Kavanaugh during law school say she did not recall the incident.
“ “The New York Times walks back..."
"Tucker Carlson has accused Kevin McCarthy of being a ""puppet of the Democratic Party"" after leaked audio revealed the House Minority Leader asked if social media companies could suspend the accounts of some GOP lawmakers in the wake of the Capitol attack.
The Fox News host made the remarks about the top Republican in the House of Representatives while talking about Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover of Twitter, and what that could mean for censorship on the platform."
"The business of smuggling migrants to the U.S.—such as the 53 who died after being left in a truck in San Antonio—has grown quickly with more illegal immigration and stronger links between smugglers and organized crime, according to U.S. and Mexican officials.
Migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador pay an estimated $1.7 billion a year to smugglers known as coyotes, according to a 2021 United Nations study. By far the biggest users of coyotes are Guatemalans.
“Migrant smuggling has become an industrial business. Demand is huge and rising, and that means you need..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump and the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week disagreed about when a COVID-19 vaccine would become widely available. Trump has said one could initially be available by the Nov. 3 election, while the CDC director said vaccines were likely to reach the general public around mid-2021, an assessment more in line with most experts.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR A VACCINE TO GENERALLY AVAILABLE?
General availability is when every American who wants the vaccine can get it. There are..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday called for another bill to expand the provisions in the $2 trillion package Congress passed last week to limit the economic devastation from the coronavirus pandemic.
“Right now, I think that we have a good model. It was bipartisan, it was signed by the president. But it’s not enough,” Pelosi told CNBC’s Jim Cramer after the government employment report showed the U.S. economy lost 701,000 jobs in early March as businesses started to shut down.
In the interview on “Squawk on the Street,”..."
"President Biden said Thursday he would support changing the Senate's filibuster rules for Congress to pass a federal law codifying Roe v. Wade.
Why it matters: With the current 60-vote threshold, Democrats have few legislative options to fight the end of the nationwide right to an abortion.
The big picture: Democrats have previously attempted and failed to pass legislation to protect abortion rights on the federal level, and while they have a 50-vote majority in the Senate, such a bill cannot pass unless they change filibuster rules.
Despite not meeting the 60-vote threshold, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has..."
"The state of Mississippi on Thursday urged the U.S. Supreme Court in a major case set to be argued in its next term to overturn the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized that women have a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. 
Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, said in papers filed with the court that the Roe v. Wade ruling and a subsequent 1992 decision that affirmed it were both “egregiously wrong” and that state legislatures should have more leeway to restrict abortion. The court has a 6-3 conservative..."
"President Biden called on states to make all adults in the U.S. eligible for Covid-19 vaccines by May 1 and set a goal for the public to be able to gather in small groups during the Fourth of July holiday.
“If we do this together, by July the Fourth, there’s a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day,” Mr. Biden said during a Thursday night primetime..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in a campaign finance case concerning how campaigns can repay candidates’ loans, in a 6-3 decision that critics warn could make it easier to bribe political candidates.
Cruz sued the Federal Election Committee regarding a rule that limits how political campaigns can reimburse candidates for loans they make to their own campaign, allowing them to repay up to $250,000 in loans at any time, and more than that only if they’re repaid within 20 days post-election.
Cruz made a $260,000..."
"A key CDC advisory committee unanimously voted to support a recommendation that Moderna and Pfizer COVID shots be allowed for children as young as six months old.
Why it matters: If CDC Director Rochelle Walensky agrees, the shots could be in little arms as early as next week.
Zoom in: The shots received emergency use authorization by the FDA on Friday after being considered by an FDA advisory committee earlier in the week. The FDA says the pediatric dose of Moderna COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine may trigger an immune response ""slightly more rapidly"" than the..."
"The public has yet to see the Senate Intelligence committee report on the rendition, detention and interrogation practices of the George W Bush administration, so its actual contents are currently the province of rumours and leaks.
With the release of its 480-page executive summary said to come on Tuesday, however, the arguments over its implications are already in full swing.
In an article in Monday's New York Times, Peter Baker says that the two-year-old report details the ""brutal techniques"" - considered torture by critics - the government employed on suspected..."

Lander, a top science adviser to Biden and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, was the focus of an internal review after subordinates complained. Politico first reported the review Monday."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is preparing to authorize Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE’s COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents aged between 12 and 15 years by early next week, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing federal officials familiar with the agency’s plans. An approval is highly anticipated after the drugmakers said in March that the vaccine was found to be safe, effective and produced robust antibody responses in 12- to 15-year-olds in a clinical trial.
Responding to a Reuters request for comment, the FDA said its..."
"The Supreme Court in a split decision on Thursday granted New York state prosecutors access to President Trump’s tax returns, even as it shielded a trove of his financial records from Congress.
The justices upheld a Manhattan district attorney subpoena for eight years of Trump’s financial documents, including his personal and corporate tax returns. But they declined to grant Congress access to records subpoenaed by a trio of Democratic-led House committees.
Both decisions were handed down in 7-2 rulings.
The ruling in the New York case makes it more..."
"A personal scandal has reshaped the pivotal Senate contest in North Carolina, as Republicans ramp up their criticism of Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham and Democrats try to manage the fallout in a race that had been leaning his way.
Mr. Cunningham, who is married, apologized for the flirtatious and sexually suggestive text messages he exchanged with a public-relations strategist soon after they emerged last week.
The strategist, Arlene Guzman Todd, said this week in a statement to the Associated Press that her relationship with Mr. Cunningham “spanned several months and..."

"Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri, a founding member of the jihadist movement and one of the key strategists behind an international campaign of terror that culminated in the 9/11 attacks on the U.S., has been killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan, U.S. congressional officials said. He was 71.
From his days as a young medical student who organized underground Islamist cells in Cairo to his years as Osama bin Laden’s top lieutenant in al Qaeda, Zawahiri was a seminal figure of modern jihad as it transformed from a movement seeking..."
"Jobless claims declined to a new pandemic low last week, in a sign hiring is primed to strengthen as workers return to the labor market.
Unemployment claims fell to 473,000 last week from a revised 507,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims are now at the lowest level since mid-March 2020, when the pandemic shut down the economy. They remain more than twice as high as levels seen before the pandemic struck last spring.

"AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford said their Covid-19 vaccine was as much as 90% effective in preventing infections without serious side effects in large clinical trials, boosting hopes that a third Western-developed shot could be authorized for use before the end of the year.
The partners said Monday that there were no confirmed serious safety events related to the vaccine and that it was well tolerated across different dosing regimens. Its efficacy ranged from 62% to 90% depending on the dosage given, with an average of 70%, they said."
"The Border Patrol made about 200,000 arrests at the southern border in July, marking the busiest month at the border in 21 years and a 12% increase over the previous month, according to new figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Thursday.
The number marks a departure from seasonal trends that would typically see fewer migrants attempting the dangerous journey at the peak of the summer heat.
Nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border in July—almost equal to the record set this March. And 76,000 parents and children crossed..."
"California's grid operator issued a statewide ""flex alert"" for Wednesday and Thursday as an intense heat wave increased electrical demand and threatened available power supplies.
Driving the news: Residents are asked to voluntary conserve energy from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. on both days while the excessive heat increases air condition use, per the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s electric grid.

"Gymnast Simone Biles chose her mental health over the possibility of a literal gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and for a lot of people that decision won't make sense.
Biles pulled out of the competition on Tuesday, and told reporters that she was concerned about the well-being of her body and mind.
The 24-year-old four-time gold medalist explained that she needed to put her mental health first. ""This Olympic Games, I wanted it to be for myself when I came in — and I felt like I was still..."
"President Barack Obama said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server was a mistake, but that U.S. national security hadn’t been endangered.
In his first extensive remarks on the controversy that has roiled the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Obama said on CBS’s “60 Minutes” program on Sunday that questions about Mrs. Clinton’s email arrangement were legitimate.

"President Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) put their political rivalry on hold Wednesday as the two toured damage from Hurricane Ian and projected a sense of unity in vowing to help the hardest-hit parts of the state rebuild.
“Today we have one job and only one job. That is to make sure the people of Florida get everything they need to fully recover,” Biden said in prepared remarks as DeSantis stood behind him.
Asked about DeSantis’s response to the storm, Biden told reporters: “I think he’s done a..."
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday acknowledged he will need to work with other parties after he fell short of winning a majority in parliamentary elections, leaving him once more dependent on opposition legislators to govern.
Trudeau, 49, was re-elected to a third term on Monday after calling a vote two years early, hoping for approval of his free-spending response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2019 he had been working with a minority, forced to make deals with other parties to push through legislation.
But provisional results showed virtually..."
"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday said he started consultations on how to unite the country and prevent further bloodshed, as the Taliban tightened their grip, seizing additional provincial capitals.
Mr. Ghani, in his first public remarks since the Taliban swept through southern and western Afghanistan, capturing the major cities of Kandahar and Herat, said his priority is to remobilize the Afghan security forces that surrendered en masse.
“As a historic responsibility, I am trying to not let the war that has been imposed on the Afghan people cause the further killing of innocents,..."
"  Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Tuesday that he believes the U.S. this spring will avoid a “national wave” of infection related to the more contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant.
However, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner said on “Squawk Box” that he thinks cases are being “dramatically” underreported in some parts of the country. Given the reliance on at-home testing now, he estimated that in the Northeast, as few as one in seven or one in eight infections are actually showing up in official case counts.
“I think we’re further into this..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden, under pressure over sky-high gasoline prices, on Wednesday demanded oil refining companies explain why they are not putting more fuel on the market as they reap windfall profits.
Biden wrote to executives from Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N), Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), and complained they had cut back on oil refining to pad profits, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.
The letter was also sent to Phillips 66 (PSX.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), BP (BP.L) and Shell (SHEL.L), a White House official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.

"The nation's most populous state is shrinking.
California’s population shrank for the second year in a row in 2021 as the nation’s most populous state was hit by declining birth rates, higher deaths from the pandemic and fewer people moving into the state from elsewhere in the U.S., officials said Monday.
California lost 117,552 people in 2021, putting its population to 39,185,605, the California Department of Finance said. That’s still the largest state population in the country ahead of second-place Texas.
But after years of steady population growth for California that..."
"President Donald Trump has claimed ""total"" power to lift the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, contradicting governors and legal experts.
""The president of the United States calls the shots,"" Mr Trump said during a combative press conference in which he feuded with reporters.
But the US Constitution says the states maintain public order and safety.
Ten states on the US East and West coasts are planning to lift their strict stay-at-home orders.

"Multiple advertisers have reportedly said they will pull their ads from Fox News shows hosted by Jeanine Pirro and Tucker Carlson in the wake of inflammatory comments made by each of the hosts.
At least three advertisers have pulled ads from Pirro's show since she suggested during a segment on ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" last Saturday that Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (D-Minn.) Islamic beliefs put her at odds with the Constitution, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
"The European Commission on Wednesday announced plans for a phased ban on all Russian oil by the end of the year, in a proposed sixth round of sanctions aimed at pressing President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine.
Why it matters: Russia is the world's second-largest crude oil exporter and Europe, unlike the U.S., is hugely reliant on Russian oil, gas and coal, per Axios' Ben Geman.
Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 member countries were expected to adopt the plans as early as this week, meaning the sanctions could soon..."
"It isn’t hard to imagine a Joe Biden administration in which Kamala Harris is vice president, Michael Bloomberg is treasury secretary, Pete Buttigieg is homeland security secretary, Tom Steyer is climate-change czar and Andrew Yang is commerce secretary—or, well, maybe special envoy for math and numbers and stuff like that.
It is, on the other hand, almost impossible to imagine a Bernie Sanders administration in which that same group of former competitors would unite.
In a nutshell, that illustrates the most basic choice Democrats face now that Mr. Biden’s candidacy..."
"Donald Trump has insisted he is not conceding the US election, despite seemingly acknowledging for the first time that Democrat Joe Biden won.
""He won because the Election was Rigged,"" the Republican president wrote on Twitter, repeating unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.
About an hour later he said he was not conceding the 3 November vote.
He has launched a slew of lawsuits in key states, but has not provided any evidence to back his claims of fraud.
All the lawsuits have so far been unsuccessful."
"President Trump said Wednesday that his campaign might be willing to accept information from foreign governments that was damaging to his 2020 rivals, adding that he might not divulge such information to the FBI.
“It’s not an interference, they have information—I think I’d take it,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with ABC News. “If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI—if I thought there was something wrong.”
But Mr. Trump maintained that he believed there wasn’t anything wrong with listening.

Confused? You’re not alone.
So what’s the deal with the CDC’s new guidance? In an effort to help combat the highly contagious delta variant, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that people in areas with “substantial” or “high” rates of COVID-19 should go back to wearing masks in public indoor spaces.

"Following the mass shooting of Uvalde, where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, many Democrats and Republicans are hoping to implement the so-called 'Red Flag' laws.
This legislation would allow authorities to temporarily remove firearms from people they believe are a danger to themselves and others.
It's unclear whether there is majority support for passing these gun laws yet, but many are pushing for it regardless.
Informal discussions surrounding these proposals began last Wednesday, a day after the massacre unfolded at Robb Elementary school.
Essentially, a 'Red Flag' law, also known as a yellow..."
"The U.S. hit a milestone in the coronavirus pandemic as all 50 states have now begun reopening, working to revive their economies after months of shutdowns designed to curb the contagion.
Slight declines in new confirmed cases in some states have prompted governors from New York to Ohio to restart some services, with rules varying from place to place, including restaurants, churches and schools. On Wednesday, Connecticut became one of the last states to loosen restrictions.
Washington, D.C., remains under stay-at-home orders, and large parts of states, including major metropolitan..."
"As more and more people return to the workplace following months of working from home, the question of one’s vaccination status is becoming increasingly relevant and, in an increasing number of cases, a condition of employment.
In both the U.S. and Europe there are a growing number of jobs and sectors which are now requiring people to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 — not only in the more obvious public-facing roles like healthcare and education but also in the technology, hospitality, travel and finance sectors.
When Covid vaccine rollouts began..."
"The US House of Representatives has passed US President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (£1.4tn) Build Back Better Act after facing fierce opposition from Republicans.
The sweeping social spending and climate package is considered a key pillar of Mr Biden's agenda.
The vote came after a record-long speech from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy to delay the vote.
The legislation now faces significant hurdles as it heads to the US Senate.
The Build Back Better Act would expand Medicare, lower prescription drug costs and includes funding for universal pre-kindergarten and subsidies for..."
"Donald Trump has tried to reassure markets about the risk of the US falling into a recession by saying the economy is doing ""tremendously well"".
The US president said he did not see a recession - usually defined as when an economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow also said there was ""no recession in sight"".
Last week, financial markets indicated a recession could be on the way.
This is because it became cheaper for the US government to borrow for 10 years, rather than..."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence forcefully rejected former President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that Mr. Pence could have overturned the 2020 election outcome during the session of Congress that was interrupted by pro-Trump rioters.
“President Trump is wrong,” Mr. Pence said in a speech Friday. “The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.”
Mr. Pence oversaw the Jan. 6, 2021, certification of President Biden’s Electoral College victory and ignored..."
"A day after the marathon voting session that saw his climate change bill passed by the Senate, President Joe Biden was off to Kentucky to meet people affected by flooding.
The state has been hit by a deluge that has toppled homes into rivers, left dozens dead and many more missing - the kind of event that will become more likely as a result of climate change.
For the president, it was a chance to cement his administration's ownership of a landmark piece of legislation on one of the most..."
"Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday defended his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report at a tense Senate hearing, explaining in detail his contacts with Mueller, who had objected to his description of the report's findings on obstruction.
In sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr said he wanted to release the report’s bottom-line conclusions as quickly as possible because the public was in a “high state of agitation” over the results of Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference and potential coordination between President Trump’s campaign and Moscow...."
"Protests and rallies continued Saturday in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling that ended constitutional protections for abortion rights, as states continue to adjust to a decision that overturned nearly 50 years of law.
Abortion-rights demonstrators have converged in cities across the U.S. since Friday’s decision. Demonstrations took place from Los Angeles to Philadelphia on Saturday, following protests Friday from Washington Square Park in New York City to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Albuquerque, N.M.
In Indianapolis, hundreds of abortion-rights supporters gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse, chanting and waving signs. “The 1950s called. They want..."

"North Carolina’s Senate race has emerged as perhaps the year’s most quiet toss-up contest.
But both parties are taking the race — one of a handful that could decide control of the upper chamber — seriously. Democrat Cheri Beasley and Republican Ted Budd met for the first time on Friday night to debate a laundry list of issues that are playing out in key races across the country.
Here are five takeaways from their debate:"
"The record-breaking heat wave roasting the West is expanding its grip on Thursday, with the focus of the triple-digit heat shifting into California — particularly the Central Valley and desert regions.
Why it matters: Across the West, the combination of record heat, preexisting drought conditions, and dry lightning strikes from afternoon thunderstorms threatens to ignite numerous wildfires Thursday.
Fires have already been burning in Montana, Arizona and other states affected by the heat wave.
More than 40 million people across the West and Southwest are likely to see temperatures in their area..."
"The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II was marked by her strong sense of duty and her determination to dedicate her life to her throne and to her people.
She became for many the one constant point in a rapidly changing world as British influence declined, society changed beyond recognition and the role of the monarchy itself came into question.
Her success in maintaining the monarchy through such turbulent times was even more remarkable given that, at the time of her birth, no-one could have foreseen that the throne would..."
"A Franklin County grand jury on Thursday indicted on two counts of rape the man accused of impregnating a 10-year-old Columbus girl who traveled across state lines to seek an abortion.
The arrest and now the indictment of 27-year-old Gerson Fuentes further confirmed the existence of the 10-year-old rape victim who was forced to seek an abortion in Indiana and brought international attention to Ohio's so-called ""heartbeat"" law.
Fuentes was arrested July 12 after police say he confessed to sexually assaulting the girl on at least two occasions. The girl became pregnant and because of Ohio's..."
"The United States will spend $3.5 billion to buy and donate 500 million doses of the Pfizer (PFE.N) coronavirus vaccine to some of the world’s poorest countries, it said on Thursday, urging other G7 nations to follow suit.

The 500 million doses are destined for the world's 100 poorest countries. A senior Biden administration official described the gesture as a ""major..."
"Republican senators on Tuesday attacked the chief executives of Facebook and Twitter for what they called censorship of President Trump and his allies during the U.S. election while Democrats bemoaned the spread of misinformation on social media. The CEOs, Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, defended their content moderation practices at a congressional hearing scheduled after the platforms decided to block stories from the New York Post that made claims about the son of then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
The move incited uproar among Republican lawmakers who..."
"More than 23 million people in Southern California were preparing on Sunday for the harshest lockdowns in the United States as COVID-19 cases spiked to record levels in the country’s most populous state. The restrictions in California, ordered by Governor Gavin Newsom to take effect on a region-by-region basis as hospital intensive care unit beds are filled almost to capacity, call for bars, hair and nail salons and tattoo shops to close again.

"President Trump on Monday threatened to permanently halt U.S. funding for the World Health Organization (WHO) if the body does not commit to ""major substantive improvements"" in the next 30 days.
The president, in a letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, levied a series of allegations that the global health entity overlooked or ignored various warning signs about the coronavirus and criticized its stance toward China during the pandemic.
""We do not have time to waste,"" he wrote. ""That is why it is my duty, as President of the..."
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she has confidence in Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden holding his own against President Trump in debates this fall.
Her comments come hours after saying earlier in the day that she doesn't think there should be any debate between the candidate and the incumbent ahead of the November election.

"President Biden has decided against appointing his own commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection and will instead increase pressure on Congress to establish a committee, White House officials tell Axios.
Why it matters: Some House Democrats suggested Biden create a presidential commission after Senate Republicans blocked the establishment of a bipartisan, independent panel. This decision signals his preference for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take the lead.
What they're saying: “Congress was attacked on that day, and President Biden firmly agrees with Speaker Pelosi that Congress itself has a unique..."

"President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner huddled at the White House Monday as the pace quickened in negotiations to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
The meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was the first face-to-face gathering between the two leaders since Mr. Boehner on Friday said he could support increased tax rates on income above $1 million a year. Mr. Boehner has also said he wants the White House to offer significant spending cuts in exchange for any new taxes, an issue that likely came up at the..."
"In the game of up-the-ante that Republican-controlled states are playing in their zeal to eradicate abortion rights, Oklahoma took the lead this week. Its new law doesn’t bother with heartbeat standards or clever enforcement mechanisms but just says it outright: Any doctor who performs any abortion at any time (other than to save a woman’s life) could face 10 years in prison. This is the oppression that awaits women throughout red-state America should the U.S. Supreme Court dismantle Roe v. Wade.
That landmark 1973 case established the right of women to determine..."
"WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged President Trump to “exercise American leadership” and keep U.S. troops in northern Syria, joining a chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers who warned the president against withdrawing from the area.
“American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal,” the Kentucky Republican said. He didn’t directly criticize Mr. Trump, but reminded him that the Senate voted in January to keep U.S. troops in Syria, in reaction to a previous withdrawal plan announced by the White House.
The remarks by Mr...."
"Unemployment claims declined to the lowest level since the pandemic struck last spring, adding to signs the U.S. economic revival is picking up speed.
Jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell to 576,000 last week from 769,000 a week earlier.
That is the lowest weekly figure since March 2020, but still way above the levels of around 220,000 that prevailed early last year, before the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. economy.
“The labor market is on a recovery path,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the job site Indeed. “The recovery..."
"Democrats are spending millions of dollars to fund the police after years of relentless attacks from Republicans claiming the party is soft on crime.
After months of negotiations within their caucus to reach a deal, House Democrats passed a four-bill criminal justice package Thursday worth millions of dollars to bolster the budgets of small local police departments around the country.
Together, the legislation would introduce millions in officer safety, de-escalation, and domestic violence response training; provide grants for small departments to recruit new officers alongside retention bonuses to keep existing..."

More than 10 million people are already thought to have fled their homes in Ukraine because of the invasion, according to the United Nations.

"President Donald Trump has vetoed a congressional resolution that sought to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the White House said on Tuesday.
“This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump said in the veto message.
The resolution passed the House of Representatives in April and the Senate in March, marking the first time both chambers of Congress had supported a War Powers resolution, which limits..."
"The Group of 20 major economies decried worsening trade tensions and their impact on global growth, with the U.S. and China locked in a protracted trade battle since negotiations fell apart a month ago. Finance ministers and central bankers fretted about the trade and geopolitical tensions and agreed to stand ready with action in case those risks intensify, according to a statement released Sunday after a weekend meeting in Japan. Their statement didn’t mention the tariffs the U.S. and China have used, though the measures and their effect weighed on..."
"Danish police said they shot dead a gunman on Sunday who they believe was behind shootings at a free-speech event at a Copenhagen cafe and a nearby synagogue a day earlier.
The suspect was shot dead on the street outside a train station in the northern part of Copenhagen after he opened fire, police said.

"FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers Thursday that racially motivated violent extremism cases account for the bulk of the bureau's work on domestic terrorist threats.
Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Wray also said most of the racially motivated cases deal with white supremacists.
""Within the domestic terrorism bucket, the category as a whole, racially motivated violent extremism is, I think, the biggest bucket within that larger group. And within the racially motivated violent extremist bucket, people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist type ideology is certainly the..."
"After a 2020 presidential campaign dominated by President Donald Trump’s words and actions, Biden on Thursday rose to the level of a true adversary as he accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for the November election.
Accused by the Republican Trump of hiding in his basement throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Biden turned his opponent’s narrative to his advantage on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, delivering an austere address in a quiet room that some commentators, both left and right, likened to a speech from the Oval Office, not..."
"Enhanced federal unemployment insurance put in place during the coronavirus pandemic ended this weekend, after nearly a year and a half.
That means some 9 million people will lose all benefits and another 3 million will see weekly checks reduced by $300, according to an estimate by The Century Foundation.
The end of the federal unemployment insurance programs comes as the delta variant of coronavirus continues to threaten the economic recovery from the pandemic and sweeping lockdowns to curb the disease last year.
At the same time, a few other..."
"The Supreme Court said Friday it would examine Oklahoma’s lethal-injection protocol, bringing new scrutiny to drug formulas states have adopted as pharmaceutical manufacturers have refused to provide narcotics for U.S. executions.
Among other issues, the court will examine whether Oklahoma’s drug protocol—a new formula the state adopted after a bungled execution in April 2014 drew international criticism—complies with the constitutional pro"
"Pope Francis has said that homosexuals should be protected by civil union laws in some of the clearest language he has used on the rights of gay people since his election seven years ago.
He made his comments in a new documentary “Francesco” by Oscar-nominated director Evgeny Afineevsky that was released on Wednesday.
“Homosexual people have a right to be in a family. They are children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable over it,” he said.

"Everything about student debt is big. There are more than 40 million borrowers and they owe an astronomical $1.6 trillion. By comparison, the major increase in military aid to Ukraine announced this week will cost only $3 billion. 
President Biden’s announcement today forgives $10,000 for millions of borrowers and up to $20,000 for recipients of the Federal Pell Grant program, which provides grants to students who have demonstrated significant financial need.

In August, Kansas voters also rejected a ballot measure that would have given the state legislature the authority to restrict abortion access through a state..."
"Former Rep. TJ Cox (D-Calif.) has been indicted on 28 counts related to financial and campaign contribution fraud, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. 
The one-term congressman is charged with “15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, one count of financial institution fraud, and one count of campaign contribution fraud,” according to a release from the Justice Department.
Public sheriff’s office records show Cox was arrested by the FBI in his hometown of Fresno, Calif., on Tuesday.
Cox was released from jail later that day after pleading not guilty, he..."
"The Biden administration is seeking to send Ukraine $500 million to help keep its government services running as the war with Russia stretches into its third month, the Treasury Department announced Thursday.
The administration will ask Congress to approve $500 million to cover the cost of Ukraine’s basic government services, including pensions, salaries and aid programs, the Treasury Department said. The aid package would be in addition to another $800 million in military support proposed by Biden on Thursday, which would also require approval from Congress.
Biden said Thursday the U.S. has almost exhausted the $13.6 billion..."
"Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Giménez, a Republican, is placing some of the blame for the recent coronavirus spike in south Florida on protesters who took to the streets following the death of George Floyd in support of Black Lives Matter, repeating an explanation that is becoming increasingly popular among Republicans, while many in the scientific community remain skeptical.
Giménez said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday that protests “had a lot to do with” causing a renewed coronavirus spike in south Florida.
The area has seen a major rise in..."
"Wearing a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask can significantly decrease the spread of COVID-19, according to a new study the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released Wednesday.
The agency updated its guidance to note that double masking or wearing a tightly fitted surgical mask are two of the best ways to boost protection against exposure.
CDC researchers experimenting in a lab found that the better the fit of the mask, the better the protection it provides.
""The effectiveness of cloth and medical procedure masks..."
"The number of applications for unemployment benefits rose sharply last week, indicating continued challenges for the U.S. economic recovery as coronavirus infections increased around the country.
Initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, rose to a seasonally adjusted 742,000 last week, up from the 711,000 filed a week earlier. That level is more than three times higher than the roughly 210,000 typically filed each week in the first two months of 2020, though it is down sharply from a peak of nearly seven million in late March."
"US Democrats have ruled out a ""witness swap"" with Republicans in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.
Lawmakers who are seeking to remove the president from office hope to hear testimony from his former National Security Adviser John Bolton.
But Democrats refused any deal to allow the son of former US Vice-President Joe Biden to be called as a witness.
Mr Trump is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He strongly denies any wrongdoing.
House Democrats have up to three days to make their case as they present..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) condemned President Biden's recent comments on shutting down power plants that burn coal Saturday, calling them ""outrageous and divorced from reality.""
Why it matters: Manchin's state is one of the country's biggest coal and gas producers. The coal-friendly senator and the president struck a deal to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a climate-focused bill, in August.
Catch up quick: Biden said Friday during a speech in California on the CHIPS Act that coal plants cost too much money and that his administration will ""be shutting these..."
"President Biden wants to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Democratic allies in Congress released new details Tuesday on legislation to lift the wage floor in phases over four years. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour since 2009, with a patchwork of states increasing the wage floor above that minimum.
Here is what we know about the status of the $15 minimum-wage proposal:"
"The White House on Tuesday canceled President Trump’s planned visit to Denmark after the prime minister said she wouldn’t entertain his proposal to purchase Greenland from the Scandinavian nation.
“Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.
The White House said later the president’s entire visit, which was scheduled for Sept...."
"President Trump on Monday said he hoped Vice President Pence “comes through for us” as he discussed efforts to overturn the presidential election results, hinting at Pence’s role overseeing the certification of the Electoral College vote count on Wednesday.
“I hope that Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. I hope that our great vice president, our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy,” Trump told a crowd of supporters at a rally in Dalton, Ga.
“Of course, if he doesn’t come..."
"A federal judge late Friday dealt a blow to the White House’s plans to build a wall along the southern U.S. border, blocking Trump administration officials from moving forward on construction projects with funds that Congress hadn’t approved.
U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam in Oakland, Calif., said President Trump’s plans to divert federal money to build a border wall, absent appropriations from Congress, exceeded the executive’s authority."
"Russia's flagship Black Sea missile cruiser has been ""seriously damaged"" and its crew forced to evacuate, Russian state media says.
The defence ministry said ammunition on the Moskva exploded in an unexplained fire, but that the 186-metre (610 foot) vessel was still afloat.
Ukraine claims it struck the vessel with its Neptune missiles.
The 510-crew warship has led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, making it an important symbolic and military target.
Earlier in the conflict the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the..."
"When President Biden this spring announced the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, his administration expected the Afghan military to defend key cities and perhaps battle the Taliban to a stalemate.
Before the current Taliban offensive, U.S. officials said they didn’t expect the takeover of any provincial capital until fall at the earliest.
Instead, a carefully planned strategy carried out by the Taliban has produced swift battlefield advances, allowing insurgents to seize a succession of provincial capitals since Friday. Three more fell Tuesday, bringing the total to nine, including several major..."
"The House on Friday passed two bills aimed at protecting access to abortion, marking the chamber’s first legislative attempts at safeguarding the procedure after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month.
The first bill — the Women’s Health Protection Act — passed in a 219-210 vote, clearing the House for a second time in the past year. The lower chamber previously approved the measure in September, but it was twice blocked in the Senate.
Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar was the only Democrat to vote against the bill, which all Republicans present opposed as well. He also..."
"Two House Republicans are working on an immigration bill that could disrupt the delicate deal struck between labor and business groups over how many visas to award to low-skilled guest workers.
GOP Reps. Ted Poe of Texas and Raul Labrador of Idaho may call for nearly twice the number of annual visas for low-skilled workers than the Senate included in its immigration bill, though they haven't yet settled on a number, two people familiar with drafts of the House bill say."
"First off, remember to breathe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -4.004% and S&P 500 Index SPX, -3.840% plunged Monday, causing trading to be temporarily halted, as traders digested news of a possible oil price war between OPEC and Russia. On Tuesday, they rose sharply higher, but did not recover all of the lost ground from the previous day. The market turmoil did not come at a good time on the back of the seemingly unstoppable, silent spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus."
"Americans are pumping the brakes on home purchases even as — or perhaps because — prices have hit new record highs.
Driving the news: Existing-home sales fell for the fifth straight month in June, declining 5.4% from May and 14.2% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday.
Meanwhile, mortgage applications fell 6.3% last week, compared with the previous week, hitting their lowest point since 2000, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday.
The median sales price of existing homes was up 13.4% year-over-year to $416,000, an all-time high.
Why it matters: Homeownership is..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Tuesday invited President Donald Trump to its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Dec. 4, starting a new phase of the inquiry that could lead to formal charges against the president within weeks.
Trump is not required to attend the hearing. But the move allows the president and his legal team access to congressional impeachment procedures that he and other Republicans have denounced as unfair, partly because the White House has not been able to call or cross-examine witnesses.
The..."
"The Republican presidential race in the Granite State increasingly looks like a referendum on Sen. Marco Rubio as much as on the current front-runner Donald Trump.
While the celebrity businessman still holds a double-digit lead ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary, Mr. Rubio ranked second in the latest Wall Street"
"Margaret Keenan, the first person outside of trial to receive Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine, received her second dose on Tuesday, making her the first patient to be fully immunized against the coronavirus.
Sky News reports that Keenan received her second dose at Coventry's University Hospital, three weeks after her first dose was administered on Dec. 8.
Upon receiving her first dose of the vaccine earlier in December, Keenan told reporters that it was a “privilege” and “the best early birthday present I could wish for.""
""We were delighted to welcome..."
"Democratic senators on Wednesday signaled they will accept a proposal by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to raise the debt limit for two months to avoid a potential economic crisis.
Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) noted that accepting McConnell’s offer to vote to raise the debt limit to a certain number high enough to cover the nation’s financial obligations until December would amount to “a temporary victory.”
“In terms of a temporary lifting of the debt ceiling, we view that as a victory, a temporary victory with more work to do,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper. 
Baldwin..."
"Ukraine said it had begun ""hard"" talks on a ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees with Russia on Monday, despite the fatal shelling of a residential building in Kyiv.
Both sides suggested at the weekend some results could be in sight after earlier rounds have primarily focused on ceasefires to get aid to towns and cities under siege by Russian forces and evacuate civilians; those truces have frequently failed. read more

"Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris' recent public comment about a ""Harris administration"" is playing into speculation that she would promptly take over for presidential nominee Joe Biden if they win in November.
""A Harris administration, together with Joe Biden as the president of the United States,"" Harris started to say Monday before apparently catching her mistake.
""The Biden-Harris administration will provide access to $100 billion in low-interest loans and investments from minority business owners,"" she quickly continued, at a virtual roundtable discussion for Arizona small-business owners.

"Tina Flournoy, the chief of staff for Vice President Kamala Harris, has established a reputation as a tough gatekeeper, using similar tactics to those she used while overseeing former President Bill Clinton’s post-White House office.
Flournoy’s tight approach, which includes blocking longtime allies from contacting Harris, has led to both praise and criticism.
It also has created tension within the vice president’s team and among her outside confidants and donors. Politico reported on Wednesday that there is dysfunction in Harris’ office and that much of the frustration stems from Flournoy. She oversaw..."
"Fewer than 6,200 people attended President Trump's campaign rally at the BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday night, well below the arena's capacity of roughly 19,000, according to the Tulsa Fire Department.
Andrew Little, the department's public information officer, told The Hill that a fire marshal recorded the tally at around 7:30 p.m., noting that the figure applied to scanned tickets from the event. The number did not account for members of the media, campaign staff and those in box suites."
"Two of President Biden’s Cabinet nominees are slamming into confirmation hurdles on Capitol Hill, testing the White House’s ability to navigate a tenuous Senate majority amid deep partisan divisions in Washington.
Biden’s pick for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Neera Tanden, now appears unlikely to be confirmed after two Senate panels delayed business meetings to vote on her nomination Wednesday.
And Republicans are solidifying their opposition to Xavier Becerra, Biden’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
Rep. Deb Haaland (D.N.M.), whose prospects were uncertain..."
"First-time claims for unemployment benefits totaled 2.1 million last week, the lowest total since the coronavirus crisis began though indicative that a historically high number of Americans remain separated from their jobs.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 2.05 million. The total represented a decrease of 323,000 from the previous week’s upwardly revised 2.438 million.
Continuing claims, or those who have been collecting for at least two weeks, numbered 21.05 million, a clearer picture of how many workers are still sidelined. That number dropped sharply, falling 3.86..."
"For an entire generation of LGBTQ+ political candidates, election is not just a personal victory, but a historic one. All 50 states have elected openly LGBTQ+ people to political office in some capacity, but representation is still lacking in a number of positions from local to federal levels of government.
In the 2020 election cycle, at least 850 LGBTQ+ candidates have appeared or will appear on ballots in the United States, according to the LBGTQ Victory Fund, almost twice as many as the 2018 election cycle. And for at..."
"The U.S.'s daily COVID-19 cases on Thursday fell below 30,000 for the first time since June.
There were 29,128 new reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. on Thursday, a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. There were 669 deaths from the virus recorded that day.
Over the past two weeks, the national average has been 32,256 new cases per day."
"Tuesday’s primaries in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont and Connecticut saw victories for Trump-endorsed candidates in the GOP, wins for progressives on the Democratic side of the aisle and a few history-making moments as well. 
Former President Trump and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) touted their endorsed candidates’ victories, while Democrats in Vermont put the state on track to send its first female representative to Capitol Hill. 
Here are five takeaways from Tuesday’s primaries.
A good night for Trump-backed candidates
Trump saw a number of victories on Tuesday, marking a second successful week in..."
"The US Department of Justice is preparing to sue Google over its dominance in the online advertising market, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. A lawsuit could be filed as soon as next month.
The Justice Department is engaged in a round of interviews with publishers to gather more information for its complaint, according to Bloomberg, which cited three unidentified sources. 
In 2020, the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google for its dominance in the search market and its alleged efforts to suppress competition in search. The lawsuit is still working its way through..."
"Only a ""limited set"" of the documents seized by the FBI from former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home may be protected by attorney-client privilege, the Department of Justice said in a court filing Monday.
Driving the news: The filing comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Trump last week seeking the appointment of a special master to review the materials seized and prevent the FBI from examining the seized documents until the special master is in place.
A special master, usually a third party like a retired judge, would review the material and determine whether it..."
"U.S. intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way, the top U.S. general said on Tuesday.
The remarks by Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, could fan speculation about the coronavirus’ origins — something China has dismissed as a conspiracy theory that is unhelpful to the fight against the pandemic.
Asked whether he had any evidence that the virus perhaps began in a Chinese laboratory and was..."
"The Kremlin's spokesperson said on Thursday that the responses to Russia's security demands from the U.S. and NATO amid the Ukraine crisis left ""little ground for optimism."" 
But Dmitry Peskov added that “there always are prospects for continuing a dialogue, it’s in the interests of both us and the Americans,” according to The Associated Press.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed Peskov's dissatisfaction with the U.S. response."
"In the immediate aftermath of the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Wednesday that the Lone Star State is ready to challenge a 40-year old decision requiring Texas to provide free public education to the children of undocumented immigrants."
"In one of the more dangerous fiscal developments of recent months, some on the left are defining successful deficit reduction as merely stabilizing the federal debt at about 70 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2022. While there is no magic target, this one is far too modest and threatens to leave future fiscal policy perilously constrained."
"President Trump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the National Archives from releasing White House records to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, citing executive privilege.
Why it matters: It's the latest escalation in Trump's campaign to disrupt the committee's sweeping probe into the circumstances surrounding Jan. 6, including his actions and communications leading up to the Capitol attack.
The big picture: Trump has already attempted to assert executive privilege to block former aides from testifying, despite subpoenas issued by the committee.
The committee will vote Tuesday evening on..."
"Democratic California Representative Maxine Waters, Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, has pledged to convene a hearing to examine ""short-selling"" and other stock market practices that have recently affected the video game retailer GameStop and other stocks.
This week, members of the subreddit r/WallStreetBets undermined hedge fund and investment firm short-sellers who had betted on GameStop's stock falling. Instead, subreddit members invested heavily into its stock, increasing its value by over 700 percent during the past week and causing the firms to lose billions.
""As a first step in..."
"Democrats kept control of the Senate on Saturday after Catherine Cortez Masto won re-election in Nevada, repelling Republican efforts to retake the chamber.
The Associated Press called Nevada for Cortez Masto on Saturday, projecting that Republican opponent Adam Laxalt—backed by former president Donald Trump—could not make enough gains to win in one of the most competitive races of the midterm elections.
Masto's victory allows Democrats to retain control of the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris' tiebreaking vote, making it harder for Republicans to..."
"Doubt is at the heart of every criminal defense: Beyond a reasonable doubt, did Derek Chauvin cause the death of George Floyd, and if so, what was the degree of his intent? Eric Nelson, a defense attorney for the former Minneapolis police officer, hammered this question home to the jury in closing arguments Monday. While the jurors might have thought the prosecution’s evidence was convincing, that wasn’t enough. It had to be convincing beyond a reasonable doubt on every count Chauvin faced: unintentional murder in the second degree, third-degree murder..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden will announce a plan on Wednesday to sell off the last portion of his release from the nation's emergency oil reserve by year's end, and detail a strategy to refill the stockpile when prices drop, a senior administration official said.
The plan is intended to add enough supply to prevent oil price spikes that could hurt consumers and businesses, while also assuring the nation's drillers the government will swoop into the market as a buyer if prices plunge too low.
Biden's efforts to use federal powers..."
"The head of a U.S. congressional panel leading the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump on Monday accused the Republican president of putting himself before his country and violating his oath of office.
In a statement kicking off a hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives to weigh the evidence against Trump, Judiciary Committee Democratic Chairman Jerrold Nadler said there was extensive proof of wrongdoing.
“The evidence shows that Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States, has put himself before his country. He has violated his most basic responsibilities..."
"The U.S. economy shrank for a second quarter in a row—a common definition of recession—as businesses trimmed their inventories, the housing market buckled under rising interest rates, and high inflation took steam out of consumer spending.
Gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy, fell at an inflation and seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.9% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That marked a deterioration from the 1.6% rate of contraction recorded in the first three months of 2022.
The report indicated..."
"Members of President Trump’s 1776 Commission are calling for “patriotic education that teaches the truth of America” and identifying “progressivism” and “racism and identity politics” among the challenges to America’s principles.
The commission, officially established by Trump in November, argues in a report released on the federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday that Americans must “stand up to the petty tyrants in every sphere who demand that we speak only of America’s sins while denying her greatness” while not “ignoring the faults in our past.”
The..."
"Iranian security forces fired both live ammunition and tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting against the Islamic Republic’s initial denial that it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, online videos purported to show Monday.
Videos sent to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran and later verified by The Associated Press show a crowd of demonstrators near Azadi, or Freedom, Square fleeing as a tear gas canister landed among them. People cough and sputter while trying to escape the fumes, with one woman calling out in Farsi: “They fired..."
"Arrests by the Border Patrol are at their highest levels ever, The Washington Post reported early Wednesday, citing unpublished U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. 
The data also reportedly show that authorities detained more than 1.7 million migrants along the border during the fiscal year that ended last month.
Migrants from outside Mexico and Central America, including Haitians, Venezuelans, Ecuadorans, Cubans, Brazilians and migrants from dozens of other nations that the CBP categorized as “other,” accounted for 367,000 arrests, according to the Post.
Approximately 309,000 migrants from Honduras were also detained, along with 279,000 from Guatemala and 96,000 from..."
"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on Monday that he will introduce bipartisan legislation encouraging states to create ""red flag"" laws and that President Trump is ""very supportive"" of the idea.
Graham, in a statement, said he has reached a deal with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on a bill that would start a federal grant program to help and encourage states to create "" 'red flag' protection order"" laws, which are meant to make it easier for law enforcement to identify mentally ill people who should be..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden will announce on Monday that 90% of adults in the United States will be eligible for vaccination against COVID-19 and have a vaccination site within 5 miles of their home by April 19, a White House official said.
Bloomberg first reported that Biden planned to make the announcement.
Biden has previously set a goal of having 200 million vaccine shots in people’s arms in his first 100 days in office."
"The Washington Post obtained 866 pages of Anthony Fauci's emails from March and April 2020 via the Freedom of Information Act, revealing what it was like for the government's top infectious-disease expert to navigate the chaotic early weeks of the pandemic under the Trump administration.
Why it matters: Fauci has been one of the most prominent public faces of the U.S. government's coronavirus response, opening him up to both widespread admiration and criticism. U.S. officials were eventually forced to assign Fauci a full-time security detail.
The big picture: Fauci told the Post that he..."
"The Senate may vote as soon as Wednesday on a bill that would prevent a government shutdown, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
Federal funding will lapse if Congress fails to pass an appropriations plan before midnight Thursday. Senators plan to introduce a bill that would keep the government running into early December, according to Schumer, a New York Democrat."
"The Senate's bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and President Biden's $3.5 trillion spending package could live or die this week — and take Democrats' fortunes with them. But all the minute-by-minute political drama obscures how much America could change if even a fraction of it passes.
The big picture: Anything short of total failure could have a transformative impact on day-to-day life — from how we move around to our access to the internet, paid family leave and child care, health care and college.
To be sure, the massive price tag that comes with these..."
"President Donald Trump said Tuesday he fired national security advisor John Bolton, saying on Twitter that Bolton had “disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions.”
But minutes later, Bolton in his own tweet said he “offered to resign” Monday night — and that Trump told him, “Let’s talk about it tomorrow.”
“I offered to resign last night. He never asked for it, directly or indirectly,” Bolton said in a later text to NBC News.
“I slept on it, and resigned this morning.”"
"China has hit back at President Donald Trump by imposing new trade tariffs on $60bn of American goods.
It comes after the US slapped duties on $200bn of Chinese imports on Monday, escalating its trade war with Beijing.
China will target American goods such as liquefied natural gas, which are produced in states loyal to the US president."
"The European Union gave its blessing on Friday for Ukraine and its neighbour Moldova to become candidates to join, in the most dramatic geopolitical shift to result from Russia's invasion.
""Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference, wearing Ukrainian colours - a yellow blazer over a blue blouse.
""We want them to live with us the European dream.""
It was only the start of a process that could take many years, but it puts Kyiv on course..."
"How the president responds to a disease outbreak is important, but it is only one aspect of multifaceted efforts at every level of government. Does a county have a system for prioritizing who receives virus tests and for delivering the results quickly? Will public transit be sanitized? Answering questions such as these is the real work of disease management — and it is not done by the White House."
"The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to issue a subpoena on Tuesday to Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey after the social-media company blocked a pair of New York Post articles that made new allegations about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, which his campaign has denied.
The subpoena would require the Twitter executive to testify on Oct. 23 before the committee, according to the Republicans who announced the hearing.
GOP lawmakers are singling out Twitter because it prevented users from posting links to the articles, which the Post said were based..."
"Worker filings for initial unemployment benefits rose by 37,000 to 412,000 last week, marking the first increase since late April and pausing what had been a steady downward trend in filings.
The increase was the biggest jump since late March, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were revised slightly to 375,000.
The four-week moving average, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, reached a new pandemic low of 395,000. This is the lowest average level since March 2020, when the pandemic first took hold in the U.S.
The latest..."
"The White House is pressing Congress to hold back on new sanctions against Iran, pitting the administration's hopes for a re-energized diplomatic engagement against the growing concern of some lawmakers and foreign allies.
The Obama administration is arguing that diplomatic efforts need more time to contain Tehran's nuclear program. But a number of Republican and Democratic lawmakers want to bring a new sanctions bill targeting Iran's oil exports and finances to a Senate vote by the end of next week. A similar bill cleared the House of Representatives in July..."
"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday instituted the largest interest rate hike in 28 years as it escalates its fight against the worst inflation in four decades and fends off criticism that it moved too slowly in easing pandemic-era stimulus measures, driving experts to increasingly question whether the economy is headed toward a recession."
"Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has become a lightning rod for the Biden administration, which is facing calls for him to resign over book excerpts underscoring his maneuvering during former President Trump’s final days in office.
Milley was already a target for conservatives before the revelations in “Peril,” the upcoming book by Watergate reporter Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post.
But the new bombshells, including that Milley twice called his Chinese counterpart following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol to assure him..."
"Elon Musk’s troubling, nascent vision for Twitter was on full display this weekend after the SpaceX and Tesla CEO strode into the center of a content moderation controversy created by Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.
West popped up on Twitter Friday night for the first time since November 2020, tweeting “Look at this Mark, How you gone kick me off instagram” with a blurry photo of himself and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg singing karaoke. The company confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Instagram indeed removed content from West’s account and placed restrictions on it..."
"President Barack Obama prepared Thursday night to unveil far-reaching changes to the immigration system, while new wrinkles on Capitol Hill complicated his opponents’ plans to block his action.
Acting without Congress, Mr. Obama is expected to shield as many as five million illegal immigrants from deportation and offer them a chance for work permits, while overhauling the enforcement system, people briefed on his plan said. His action would represent the most significant changes to U.S. immigration policy in nearly three decades.
Hours before Mr. Obama was scheduled to outline his..."
"Attorney General William Barr said his review of the origins of the Russia investigation is focused on U.S. intelligence gathering before the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened its formal inquiry in July 2016 and could lead to rule changes for counterintelligence investigations of political campaigns.
“Government power was used to spy on American citizens,” Mr. Barr told The Wall Street Journal, in his first interview since taking office in February. “I can’t imagine any world where we wouldn’t take a look and make sure that was done properly.”
He added:..."
"The George Zimmerman verdict shouldn't really surprise anyone. The case really couldn't have gone any other way; in a situation like this with few witnesses and a lot of conflicting accounts, it is much easier for the defense to put enough reasonable doubt in the jury's minds than it was for the prosecution to do otherwise. The problem, really, has less to do with the specifics of the case and law and a lot more to do with how we apply that law.
This was brought to my attention initially..."
"Former Trump administration senior adviser Jason Miller said Sunday that the former president plans to return to social media in the coming months with his “own platform.”
Miller told Fox News’s Mediabuzz that Trump was “returning to social media in two or three months” with “his own platform.” Miller also added the platform would “completely redefine the game” and rake in “tens of millions” of users.
The Hill has reached out to Trump’s representatives for comment."
"President Biden said he would nominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term leading the central bank, opting for continuity in U.S. economic policy despite pushback from some Democrats who wanted someone tougher on bank regulations and climate change.
Mr. Biden said he would also nominate Fed governor Lael Brainard as vice chairwoman of the central bank’s board of governors. Prominent liberals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) had warned the president against picking Mr. Powell, and progressive groups mounted a last-ditch campaign to pressure the president to tap..."
"Low bail that led to the release of the man accused of driving an SUV through a downtown Christmas parade and killing six people here is prompting debates among lawmakers over bail policies in the state.
The suspect, 39-year-old Darrell Brooks, has a history of arrests. As recently as Nov. 5 he was charged with disorderly conduct and recklessly endangering safety after punching the mother of his child, then running her over with a vehicle, according to a complaint.
After posting $1,000 cash bail on Nov. 11, Mr. Brooks was released, the..."
"Star U.S. gymnasts offered stark criticism Wednesday of the FBI's handling of its investigation into sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. gymnastics program, prompting criticism from lawmakers of the Department of Justice.  
“We have been failed and we deserve answers,” Olympic medalist Simone Biles, widely considered the greatest U.S. gymnast of all time, said during testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The entire day of testimony was a difficult one for the FBI, which fired one agent involved with the investigation a week before the hearing. "
"Former President Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reportedly spoke on the phone Thursday night after audio was released of McCarthy saying he considered telling Trump to resign following the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol.
The Washington Post reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Trump was not upset about McCarthy’s remarks and was glad that he didn’t push him to resign like he said he would. 
The pair reportedly spoke after MSNBC aired audio of McCarthy’s taped remarks during “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Thursday night after obtaining audio..."
"Ukrainian forces are warily advancing towards the occupied city of Kherson, after Russia's defense minister publicly announced a retreat. Yet the prospect of messy urban warfare looms large.
A liberation of Kherson—the only provincial capital seized by Russian troops since the invasion began in February—will be a major blow to the Kremlin, which has failed for months to seize back momentum.
But the strategic importance of the city raises the prospect that Russian troops will not leave quietly. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops would proceed ""very carefully,"" while presidential..."

"Senate Democrats have struck a deal to lower the income cut off for receiving a stimulus payment as part of the coronavirus bill, a Democratic aide confirmed to The Hill.
The decision, which speeds up the phasing out of checks, reflects a demand from moderates to curb the ability of high-income earners to receive the stimulus payments.

"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fueled concern over China’s plans for Taiwan, which it has repeatedly threatened to invade. Some speculate that the odds of invasion have increased, while others argue that Western unity and Russian military failures should counsel Chinese caution regarding the island.
This discussion conflates two different questions: Has the Ukraine conflict changed Beijing’s willingness to use force against Taiwan? And has the Ukraine conflict altered Beijing’s and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) assessments of its ability to conduct a successful amphibious invasion of Taiwan?
China’s willingness to use force is a political..."

"Abortion has long been a contentious issue in the United States, and it is one that sharply divides Americans along partisan, ideological and religious lines.
Today, a 59% majority of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 39% think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. These views are relatively unchanged in the past few years. The latest Pew Research Center survey, conducted April 5 to 11, finds deep disagreement between – and within – the parties over abortion.

But there were no concrete signs of defection from the armed forces leadership, despite a years-long deep economic crisis and support for..."
"Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys, and four other members of the far-right group have been indicted on seditious conspiracy charges in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, marking an escalation in the Justice Department’s riot probe.
A grand jury on Monday returned the indictment against Mr. Tarrio and co-defendants Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola, charging them with two new counts. The men already had been indicted in March on conspiracy and other charges stemming from the attack, with prosecutors alleging they..."
"Facing both turbulent financial markets and raging inflation, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday indicated it could soon raise interest rates for the first time in more than three years as part of a broader tightening of historically easy monetary policy.
In a move that came as little surprise, the Fed’s policymaking group said a quarter-percentage point increase to its benchmark short-term borrowing rate is likely forthcoming. It would be the first rise since December 2018.
Chairman Jerome Powell added that the Fed could move on an aggressive path."
"A campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders warned about mass violence and advocated for the use of gulags for ""re-education"" in a conversation caught on tape by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. In the undercover video, Kyle Jurek, an Iowa field organizer for the Sanders campaign, said the country will have to ""spend billions"" on re-education for people that are ""Nazified.""
Jurek said the candidate's ""free education"" policies will ""teach you how not to be a f*cking Nazi."" He touted post-war Germany spending money to ""re-educate"" people not to..."
"U.S. Senate leader Mitch McConnell dealt a likely death blow on Wednesday to President Donald Trump’s bid to boost coronavirus aid to Americans, declining to schedule a swift Senate vote on a bill to raise relief checks to $2,000 from $600.
McConnell said on the Senate floor that a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which sought to meet fellow Republican Trump’s demands for bigger checks, “has no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate.”
McConnell, who controls the Senate’s agenda and opposes the increase in aid, had..."
"White House telephone logs obtained by the House probe of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot show an hourslong gap in calls on the day of the attack at a time when investigators know then-President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers spoke on the phone, NBC News reported Thursday.
Those records show no calls made by Trump, or to him, for several hours after his speech outside the White House, which began shortly before a violent mob of his supporters stormed into the Capitol, a source familiar with the records told NBC."
"The U.S. House committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on Congress has found gaps in official White House telephone logs on the day of the deadly riot, with few records of calls by then President Donald Trump during the hours investigators know he was making them, the New York Times reported.

"Bernie Sanders is fighting to oust two Hillary Clinton supporters heading key Democratic National Convention committees, despite the party’s refusal to remove them, in the latest sign of disunity amid a bitter fight for the presidential nomination.
An attorney for Mr. Sanders’s campaign sent a letter to Democratic National Committee officials on Friday asking them to disqualify former congressman Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who are co-chairmen of the convention’s rules and platform committees, respectively."
"President Biden laid out his gun control agenda on Thursday night, saying America should be unified around the provisions he suggested.
The big picture: Biden called on Congress to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban, which was passed in 1994 and expired under President George W. Bush in 2004. He also called for expansions on background checks, raising the age limits to purchase semi-automatic rifles and red flag laws.
Biden added there should be a ban on certain semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines.
Other recommendations from Biden included:

"U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday failed to advance voting-rights legislation for the fourth time this year due to overwhelming Republican opposition, raising potential ramifications for the 2022 congressional and 2024 presidential elections.
The Senate voted 50-49 in favor of starting debate on the ""John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act"" but fell short of the 60 votes needed under a procedural blocking maneuver known as a filibuster. Named for the late civil rights activist and congressman, the legislation would restore state voting requirements to prohibit racial discrimination that were struck down..."
"WASHINGTON—Nearly a dozen American troops were injured in the Iranian missile attack on two bases in Iraq last week, Defense Department officials said, after initially stating that there were no casualties in the strikes.
Eleven individuals are being screened for traumatic brain injuries following the attacks on two bases in Iraq that house American troops. Iran fired a dozen rockets total at Erbil in northern Iraq and the sprawling Al Asad air base in the west in retaliation for the American killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani days before.

"The spotlight is once again on the State of California and its proposed new mathematics framework for grades K-12. The proposed framework would ""de-mathematize math"" and encourage the use of a ""trauma-informed pedagogy,"" as an open letter to Governor Gavin Newsom signed by more than 900 professors of math and science from across California put it. The framework also rejects the idea of natural or innate giftedness among children and discourages allowing students to be placed into accelerated courses even if they have mastered the material covered in the course.
And it would be a disaster.
No doubt,..."
"Butch Bowers, the lead attorney who was slated to represent former President Trump during his second impeachment trial in just more than a week, has left the legal team along with four other members, according to multiple reports.

Citing ""multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge"" of the operation, CNN reported that US intelligence feared the source's cover could be blown by US officials.

"A run on Russian banks is underway.
Russia’s ruble dropped dramatically in Monday’s trading on the news of unprecedented sanctions levied on Moscow by the EU and U.S. for its invasion of Ukraine.
Lines at ATMs snaked down sidewalks and around buildings in Moscow and at Russian banks in Europe as depositors rushed to withdraw cash. Sberbank Europe, which is owned by Russia’s state-run Sberbank, says it has experienced “significant outflows of deposits in a very short time.”"

"Conservative pundit Steven Crowder punched deep into the debate over social media and censorship this week with the announcement that he is suing Facebook for what he believes are unfair and secretive policies.
But the move comes as a new report was published saying that claims of social media bias against conservatives is disinformation, “a falsehood with no reliable evidence to support it.”
The report, issued by New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, dismisses accusations by former President Donald Trump and Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee,..."

Why it matters: The tech giants are yet again facing a potential grilling on Capitol Hill sometime before the end of the year, at a time when tech is being used as a punching bag from both the left and right.
Yes, but: The subpoenas will only be issued if the executives refuse to come voluntarily. The Commerce panel will first be..."
"A U.S. appeals court on Friday temporarily blocked President Joe Biden's plan to cancel billions of dollars in college student debt, one day after a judge dismissed a Republican-led lawsuit by six states challenging the loan-forgiveness program.

"Early Thursday morning, after 20 hours of talks, the White House announced that a looming rail strike was averted and a tentative deal struck between the freight rail operators and their unions. The run-up to the agreement had businesses — and the economy — on the brink.
Why it matters: The negotiations, which started in 2019 but reached a fever pitch this week, were the latest issue to pop up in the game of supply chain whack-a-mole we've played for two-plus years.
Virtually every part of the economy needs functioning railways. Plus, a strike..."
"The US House of Representatives has passed sweeping legislation that prohibits LGBT discrimination, but it faces an unlikely future in the Senate.
The Equality Act was previously passed by the Democratic-led House in 2019, but was killed by Senate Republicans.
The debate has laid bare the ideological battle between liberals who support the act and conservatives who say it infringes on religious freedom.
The act expands on a 2020 Supreme Court ruling protecting some LGBT rights."
"WASHINGTON — House impeachment managers, failing to get the Senate to subpoena witnesses in the trial of President Donald Trump, turned their sights Monday to the long-shot goal of removing a president from office for the first time in history.
In impassioned speeches, several laced with religious language and messages, the prosecutors asked senators to be numbered among the “Davids who slew Goliath” by exercising faith in the Founding Fathers and to convict Trump, who is “guilty as sin.”

"The House Oversight and Reform Committee approved legislation on Wednesday that would make Washington, D.C., a state, sending the measure to the House for a vote later this month.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee passed H.R. 51, also known as the Washington, D.C., Admission Act, in a 25-19 party-line vote.
The legislation, which has 215 co-sponsors, is likely to pass the House on a narrow, party-line vote, with all Republicans voting against it.
However, it will likely stall in an evenly divided Senate, where Democrats lack the 60..."

"The purpose of Monday’s televised debate was to find policy common ground between South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and self-described Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders — two veteran U.S. senators with not a whole lot in common.
The two did agree that Social Security has a solvency problem, that the future of the country’s transportation will be electric and that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""sucks.""

"House Republicans on Friday elevated Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) to replace Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as the party’s conference chair, capping a tumultuous three-week stretch that exposed deep divisions in a conference beholden to former President Trump.
Stefanik, who was backed by Trump and top House GOP leaders, easily defeated Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who launched a last-minute challenge over concerns Stefanik’s voting record is too liberal. The vote, conducted by secret ballot, was 134-46.

"A record 6.6 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, marking a sharp downturn in the labor market caused by the new coronavirus.
The large number of claims comes after 3.3 million sought benefits two weeks ago as the U.S. shut down parts of the economy in an effort to contain the virus. Jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, provide temporary financial assistance for workers who lose their jobs.
More Americans are expected to have filed for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks than in the prior six..."
"President Biden on Friday revoked a 2019 proclamation signed by then-President Trump that prevented immigrants from obtaining visas unless they proved they could obtain health insurance or pay for health care.
Biden said in his own proclamation signed Friday afternoon that the October 2019 order ""does not advance the interests of the United States.""
“My Administration is committed to expanding access to quality, affordable healthcare,” Biden's proclamation states. “We can achieve that objective, however, without barring the entry of noncitizens who seek to immigrate lawfully to this country but who..."
"Russian president Vladimir Putin is keeping the world guessing as western intelligence says the invasion he ordered of Ukraine has not been as successful or as swift as he had hoped.
Nearly a week into the largest military campaign in Europe since World War Two, Russian forces have encountered fierce resistance from Ukraine while global condemnation has spurred sanctions that have roiled the Russian economy.
Before the invasion, Putin humiliated his spy chief, Sergei Naryshkyn in a Russian Security Council meeting which showed the president relishing being in control.
But now with..."
"The U.S. has reported more than 3,400 confirmed or suspected monkeypox cases, federal data showed, becoming the country with the most known infections since the onset of the global health emergency.
The rise in cases comes as the U.S. expands testing capacity, broadening the ability to spot new infections, but also as the global outbreak continues to grow. Some public-health experts said rising transmission heightens the chances a broader population will face the risk of infections as the opportunity to slow and potentially stop the outbreak is fading.
The outbreak has largely been..."

But in 11 states, voters will also pick their next governor. It’s more common to hold governors’ races during midterm elections, so the few gubernatorial contests held in presidential election years sometimes get overlooked while the spotlight is trained on races for federal office.

"Former President Donald Trump sued CNN (Left bias) for defamation on Monday, seeking at least $475 million in damages.
Trump’s lawsuit alleges that CNN used “false, defamatory, and inflammatory mischaracterizations” to interfere with Trump’s political career. It argues that the phrase “the Big Lie,” in reference to Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud, is an attempt to connect Trump to Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf.” “Beyond simply highlighting any negative information about the plaintiff and ignoring all positive information about him, CNN has sought to use its massive influence — purportedly..."

"Remember President Trump’s tax returns? It seems like a relic from the distant past, but only last December, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a trio of cases on whether the president could block his accounting firm and two of his banks from turning over eight years of tax returns and other financial records to Democratic-led House committees and New York City prosecutors. Trump’s lawyers have offered an extraordinarily expansive vision of his power as president, arguing that as chief executive he is immune from criminal investigations and congressional..."

"Democrats in the U.S. Senate hope on Tuesday to advance sweeping election reform legislation making it easier for Americans to cast ballots, despite intense opposition from Republicans, many of whom support new restrictive voting rules at the state level.
The 886-page bill would expand mail-in voting that was used widely in last year's presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic and would lengthen the hours of in-person balloting.
The bill faces long odds in the Senate, where 10 Republicans would have to join with Democrats for it to pass.

"From the first weeks of the Afghanistan war to its final days, U.S. officials repeatedly championed the use of aerial surveillance technology to distinguish friend from foe, fighter from civilian, and eliminate America’s enemies with pinpoint accuracy. The technology was heralded as a way to minimize civilian casualties and reduce the risks and costs of ground deployments. In practice, though, the U.S. military got it wrong — a lot — leading to high-profile civilian deaths and handing the Taliban a potent recruitment tool.
After weeks of hesitation, the Pentagon admitted Friday that it..."

This CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for the first quarter 2020 — which includes responses from more than 2,100 small business owners — was conducted the same week (Feb. 3–Feb. 10) as Trump’s third State of the Union address, his..."
"U.S. stock indexes were set for a subdued open on Thursday after data showed an unexpected rise in weekly jobless claims, while a steady flow of positive earnings reports offered markets some support.
The Labor Department’s report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased by 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 419,000 for the week ended July 17. Still, the number likely does not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions, with another month of strong job growth expected in July.

"The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is suspending enforcement of the Biden administration’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for large private businesses after a federal appeals court upheld a stay on it last week.
OSHA said in a statement published on its website Friday night that while it is confident in its power to protect workers amid the pandemic, it is suspending activities related to the mandate, citing the pending litigation.
“The court ordered that OSHA 'take no steps to implement or enforce' the ETS [Emergency Temporary Standard] 'until further court order.' While OSHA remains confident in its..."
"The state funeral for Queen Elizabeth will be held on Monday, Sept. 19, royal officials said on Saturday, as her son Charles was officially proclaimed Britain's new king in a colourful ceremony laden with pageantry and tradition.
The death of the 96-year-monarch after 70 years on the throne set in train long-established and highly choreographed plans for days of national mourning and a state funeral.
Elizabeth's coffin will leave her Scottish estate on Sunday and be driven by hearse through remote highland villages to Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, pausing during its..."
"President Biden on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19, according to the White House.
The big picture: Biden, who is fully vaccinated and received a second booster shot in March, has ""very mild"" symptoms, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
The 79-year-old president is continuing to work remotely while isolating at the White House and will ""carry out all of his duties fully during that time,"" Jean-Pierre added. His last negative test was taken on Tuesday.
Biden is also taking Paxlovid, Pfizer's COVID antiviral drug, the White House said. Vice..."
"President Joe Biden’s attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, vowed on Monday to protect the integrity of the Justice Department from partisan influence, in an effort to restore confidence after President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to bend the department to his will. Trump, a Republican who lost to Biden in November, for years attacked Justice Department investigations of his 2016 campaign and Russian election interference as a “witch hunt” or a “hoax.”
Garland, in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, also vowed to make the investigation of the Jan...."
"President Biden signed an executive order on Friday aimed at protecting abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
Why it matters: Biden has faced intense pressure from his own party to act more aggressively on abortion. Many conservative states had ""trigger laws"" in place that banned or severely limited abortions in the days following the ruling and more bans are expected.
While the order will not restore access to abortion in the states that have already banned or restricted the procedure, it could enhance the administration's efforts to help people know what rights they do have...."
"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol sent a number of subpoenas on Monday, including to top 2020 Trump campaign aides and the lawyer responsible for crafting the strategy for how the former president could seek to overturn the election results in Congress. 
Among the six subpoenas released is one for John Eastman, who drafted a memo advising the Trump campaign both to use supposed vice presidential authority to push back on election results and to get state legislatures to reject electors from certain states in order..."
"At a recent Ivy League swim meet, spectators were split over which side of the pool to look at. 
At one end, several women jackknifed their bodies in flip turns for the final lap of the 500-meter freestyle. Their furious kicks churned the water and left white vapor trails in the sky-blue pool. On the other end, a swimmer named Lia Thomas had already finished and broken the Harvard pool record. In the 7.5 seconds it took for the second-place swimmer to arrive, Ms. Thomas adjusted her swimming cap, took..."
"SURE, YOU’VE BEEN stuck at home and are now feeling Zoom fatigue. Chances are your kid is too. That’s why it’s important for them to carve out a space of their own to connect remotely, for school or just hanging out with friends. After all, if they’re not happy with their immediate surroundings, the video meetups from home will be all the more unsatisfying.
Whether it’s Zoom or another videoconferencing tool, here are some tips to help your kids optimize the experience. Before you get too far into it, be..."
"Though the number of job openings fell more than expected in November, the number of Americans quitting their jobs jumped to record territory, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, further illustrating the struggle employers are facing in filling—and retaining—jobs during the pandemic. 
The number of people quitting their jobs in November jumped to a record-high 4.5 million—surpassing the previous record of 4.4 million, set in September, according to the Labor Department’s job openings and labor turnover report.
The quits rate increased to 3%, matching the series high in September, with..."
"In recent election cycles, party loyalty – and deep suspicion of “the other side” – has meant fewer voters willing to split their vote. But this time around, they could decide control of the Senate.
While parties and pundits may cast America as neatly lined up into tribal camps, competing in a zero-sum contest for the future of the republic, allow Richard Bink to break the mold.
The Savannah, Georgia, veterinarian voted early at Islands Library here on Georgia’s Whitemarsh Island as ibises veered through an ultramarine sky. He usually..."
"The Secret Service provided only one text exchange to the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general for a month’s worth of records requests for 24 Secret Service personnel, CNN reported on Wednesday. 
CNN obtained a letter from the Secret Service to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, revealing that Inspector General Joseph Cuffari requested in June 2021 that the Secret Service provide text messages for two dozen personnel from Dec. 8, 2020, to Jan. 8, 2021. 
The letter’s revelation comes in the aftermath of Cuffari informing the committee that the..."
"Millions of Americans are skipping the second COVID-19 vaccine shot, according to data released Sunday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A report published by the CDC on vaccine completion status through April 9 shows that 8% of all patients — roughly 5 million Americans — who had one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna skipped the second dose.
The percentage of those not getting their second shot doubled from 3.4%, according to the CDC’s data through mid-February.

"The sudden collapse of FTX, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, underlines how important it is for any investor to learn about the risks they take when they park their money with a lightly regulated firm.
FTX and its affiliate companies filed for bankruptcy Nov. 11. The company’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, resigned his position as CEO and was replaced by John J. Ray III, a lawyer who has worked on the bankruptcies of Enron, Nortel Networks and many other companies.
Bankman-Fried is staying on with FTX “to assist with an orderly..."
"Portland’s Police Bureau says it’s struggling to respond to 911 calls, including reports of assault, burglary and theft, as violence continues to escalate amid over 80 days of Black Lives Matter protests.
Police told the New York Post on Sunday night that dozens of people were struggling to reach 911 operators as officers were directed to quell sometimes aggressive crowds, throwing rocks and bottles at officers.
Among those requesting help were people calling to report “theft, vandalism, suspicious activity, hazards, hit and run, burglary, violation of restraining order, alarms,..."
"President Joe Biden defended his decision to end America’s longest war in Afghanistan in his address to the United Nations on Tuesday, a move that he says will allow the U.S. to pivot to other global challenges like the Covid pandemic, climate change and an ambitious China.
Biden’s debut address to the 193-member body since taking office in January comes as the U.S. president strives to rebuild alliances that crumbled under the reign of his predecessor and reclaim a global leadership position. He addressed a scaled-down gathering at the 76th United Nations..."
"The Department of Homeland Security will pause the work of a controversial board to coordinate efforts to battle disinformation, saying that while its work was “grossly and intentionally mischaracterized” the “false attacks have become a significant distraction.”
Its leader, disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz, will also resign from the department.
Designed as a way to coordinate efforts across the department with disparate missions, the Disinformation Governance Board prompted attacks from Republicans and civil rights groups alike. "
"Another 5.2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total seeking aid in a month of coronavirus-related shutdowns to 22 million and showing a broad shock for the U.S. labor market.
Total claims filed in the week ended April 11 were down from the 6.6 million filed the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. For the March 28 week, 6.9 million claims were filed, and 3.3 million the week before. Prior to the pandemic, the largest number of Americans to ask for unemployment benefits in a..."
"US President Joe Biden has warned China is ""flirting with danger"" over Taiwan, and vowed to intervene militarily to protect the island if it is attacked.
Speaking in Japan, he appeared to contradict long-standing US policy in the region, although the White House insisted there had been no departure.
Mr Biden drew a parallel between Taiwan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting an angry rebuke from Beijing.
He is on his first tour of Asia as US president, visiting regional allies.
Mr Biden prefaced his remarks saying US policy toward..."
"The House passed a bill that would provide protection for same-sex and interracial marriage under federal law, with Democratic lawmakers saying the recent Supreme Court ruling ending abortion rights could endanger other precedents.
The 267-157 vote on the Respect for Marriage Act comes the same week the chamber is also set to vote on the Right to Contraception Act. Both pieces of legislation would enshrine into law rights not enumerated in the Constitution but that the court has recognized in recent decades. Senate Democrats haven’t said if they will schedule votes on the House bills...."
"Confidence in President Biden's ability to rescue the economy from COVID-19 has dropped since January, even as Americans' faith rises in his ability to make the vaccine widely accessible, according to the latest installment of the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index.
Why it matters: It's Democrats and independents driving the declining economic confidence, from 52% of all U.S. adults at the start of his presidency to 44% now. Their softening faith could hinder Biden's ability to lead and hurt Democrats' position heading into the 2022 midterms.
In another ominous sign, barely two in 10..."
"More than 70 percent of federal inmates who have been tested for the coronavirus have COVID-19, the Bureau of Prisons said Wednesday.
About 2,700 inmates have been given tests, and 71 percent of those came back positive. Officials say they expect the overall number of cases to rise since testing so far has covered less than 2 percent of the 153,000 inmates in the federal system, The Wall Street Journal reported.
While the low testing rate mirrors that of the general U.S. population, prisons and jails face unique challenges in..."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized new Covid booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer that more closely match the strains of the coronavirus that are currently circulating in the U.S.
Pfizer’s booster, made with partner BioNTech, is being authorized for people as young as 12 years old. The Moderna booster is being authorized for people ages 18 and up.
Use of the new boosters still requires the signoff the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s vaccine advisory panel is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday and could vote..."
"A joint statement by Mr Trump, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed Al Nahyan said they hoped the ""historic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East"".
As a result, they added, Israel would suspend its controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.
Until now Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries
However, shared concerns over Iran's regional influence have led to unofficial contacts between them.
In response to President Trump's announcement, Mr Netanyahu tweeted in Hebrew: ""Historic day."""
"One intriguing aspect of a new criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein is that the matter is assigned to the Public Corruption Unit of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office. As its name implies, that unit typically handles cases involving public officials. Epstein is instead the billionaire money manager who socializes with powerful people such as Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.
On Monday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) announced criminal charges against Epstein, alleging that he “sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls”..."
"The coronavirus pandemic poses an obvious threat to physical safety, but advocates stress that Americans shouldn’t sleep on their mental health.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, whose state has become an epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis, said Wednesday that more than 6,000 mental-health professionals had volunteered to provide free mental-health services.
The Empire State had at least 60,000 confirmed cases as of Monday morning, up from 37,258 just four days ago, making up a disproportionate share of the United States’ 143,055 confirmed cases. New York City accounts for..."
"Researchers are warning that the coronavirus pandemic could inflict long-lasting emotional trauma on an unprecedented global scale. They say it could leave millions wrestling with debilitating psychological disorders while dashing hopes for a swift economic recovery.
The COVID-19 crisis has combined mental health stressors that have been studied before in other disasters, but which have never been seen consolidated in one global crisis, experts in trauma psychology said.
It has left millions without jobs, sent billions into isolation and forced nearly everyone on earth to grapple with the feeling that..."
"The mutant coronavirus strain first identified in the United Kingdom remains at low levels in the United States but is doubling its reach approximately every 10 days, according to a study published by researchers on Sunday.
The study bolstered modeling done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which predicted last month that the more contagious variant could be the dominant strain in the U.S. by March. The U.S. still has time to take steps to slow down the new virus strain, the researchers wrote, but they warned that..."
"New York on Monday inoculated its first healthcare worker, an intensive care unit nurse in Queens, with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, marking a pivotal turn in the U.S. effort to control the deadly virus.
Sandra Lindsay, an ICU nurse, was given the vaccine at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, New York, an early epicenter of the country’s COVID-19 outbreak, receiving applause on a livestream with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
“It didn’t feel any different from taking any other vaccine,” Lindsay said. “I feel hopeful today, relieved. I..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday predicted that Republicans have a better chance of flipping the House than the Senate, citing candidate quality, again taming expectations for the upper chamber less than three months out from the midterm elections.
“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said when asked about his expectations for the midterms during an event in Kentucky, according to NBC News...."
"A Ukrainian MP said that a missile strike on an apartment block in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia was a ""war crime"" carried out by Russian forces who intended to step up their attacks on civilian targets.
The strikes came hours after the Kremlin said it was formally seizing Europe's biggest nuclear power plant nearby. Ukrainian emergency services said three bodies have been pulled from the rubble of the five-story apartment block and a three-year-old girl was among those saved.
Local officials said seven rockets hit residential buildings in strikes..."
"WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court said Tuesday that it will not hear a closely watched case against gunmaker Remington, a move the company has warned could potentially increase the liability of firearm manufacturers to suits brought by victims of gun crimes.
The court’s action will allow the family members of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre to move forward with their lawsuit. The shooting left 20 children and six adults dead."
"House Democrats on Tuesday said they would bring two articles of impeachment against President Trump, setting up just the third vote to impeach a U.S. president in history.
""Today, in the service to our duty to the Constitution and to our country, the House Judiciary Committee is introducing two articles of impeachment, charging the president of the United States of committing high crimes and misdemeanors,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said before introducing the first article.
The charges brought by Democrats are that Trump abused the power of..."
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his long-awaited report on alleged collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
A justice department official said Mr Mueller's report did not recommend any further indictments.
The special counsel has already charged six former Trump aides and dozens of Russians.
The Attorney General William Barr will now summarise the report and decide how much to share with Congress.
Mr Barr told congressional leaders in a letter that he anticipated being able to inform them of the report's key..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday called on lawmakers to pass legislation requiring strong background checks for firearm purchases following two mass shooting in Texas and Ohio over the weekend that killed 29 people.
Trump, who is scheduled to deliver remarks at the White House later on Monday morning following the attacks, said the victims’ deaths could not be “in vain” and called on both political parties to take steps to require further screenings for gun buyers.
“We cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die..."
"U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly eight years in June as businesses reopened, but the underlying trend suggested inflation would remain muted and allow the Federal Reserve to keep injecting money into the ailing economy.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its consumer price index increased 0.6% last month, the biggest gain since August 2012, after easing 0.1% in May. The increase, which ended three straight months of declines, was driven by rises in the prices of gasoline and food.
In the 12 months through June, the..."
"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s election on Tuesday was too close to call, exit polls indicated, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party virtually level with Benny Gantz’s centrist Blue and White.
The exit polls by three Israeli broadcasters had Gantz slightly ahead or tying with Netanyahu, likely meaning days or weeks of wrangling over which candidate might form the next coalition government."
"The Princeton University Board of Trustees voted on Friday to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from the university’s School of Public and International Affairs. It acted because Wilson’s racist opinions and policies make him an inappropriate namesake for a school whose scholars, students and alumni must stand firmly against racism and for equality and justice.
For my university, the decision was momentous. Wilson was an undergraduate alumnus of Princeton, a distinguished professor on its faculty and eventually its 13th president. He transformed the place from a sleepy college to a world-class..."
"A transportation reporter for the Associated Press was told by federal government sources that they would be fired if they provided information to the journalist, AP Washington Bureau Chief Sally Buzbee says.
Not for turning over classified information a la Edward Snowden. Not for giving up the innermost secrets of the CIA or the NSA.
For furnishing information about the oh-so-sensitive world of transportation.
It's been clear for some time that the Obama administration has a terrible record when it comes to transparency. (Never mind that candidate Barack Obama vowed..."
"Democrats begin formally making their case on Wednesday that former President Donald Trump should be convicted for inciting the U.S. Capitol siege, a day after a divided Senate concluded his impeachment trial could proceed even though Trump has already left office.
The House of Representatives has charged Trump with inciting an insurrection after he delivered a fiery speech on Jan. 6 exhorting thousands of supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol, where members of Congress were gathered to certify President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.
In an assault that stunned the..."
"Manufacturers of everything from flash drives to glass for Apple iPhone screens are warning of shipment delays as they comply with Chinese controls to curb the spread of COVID-19, further straining global supply chains.
Authorities across China are trying to try stem the spread of the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak in two years, putting millions of people in lockdown, curbing transport and shutting factories.
Some of the toughest measures have been applied in the key manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, as well as the Chinese financial centre of..."
"New applications for unemployment benefits held nearly steady last week after a period of larger declines, a sign an increased number of Covid-19 cases in some states and related restrictions on businesses is causing the labor market’s healing to stall.
Initial unemployment claims fell by a seasonally adjusted 10,000 to 1.3 million for the week ended July 11, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
That narrowly extends a trend of declines from a peak of 6.9 million in late March, when the coronavirus pandemic and mandated business closures shut down swaths..."
"President Barack Obama‘s budget for next year, released Monday, is filled with ideas, programs and proposals with prospects for adoption by the new Republican-controlled Congress that range from dismal to zero.
Then there is corporate tax reform.
It may seem illogical to direct hopes for agreement toward one of the most far-reaching and politically fraught proposals on the president’s wish list, but, in fact, there are two big forces that can pry open the door to at least a serious bipartisan discussion on corporate tax reform this year. The first..."
"The United States plans to send roughly 4 million doses of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine that it is not using to Mexico and Canada in loan deals with the two countries, an administration official told Reuters on Thursday.
Mexico will receive 2.5 million doses of the vaccine and Canada is to receive 1.5 million doses, the official said.
“We’re lending a portion of our releasable doses of AstraZeneca vaccine,” the official said on condition of anonymity. “We only put the virus behind us if we’re helping our global partners.”

"House Democrats are threatening to subpoena the White House for documents on President Trump's dealings with Ukraine as part of their impeachment inquiry, with three House panels signaling Wednesday they plan to move forward with the effort unless they get the material.
“Over the past several weeks, the Committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with—or even respond to—the Committees,” reads a memo from House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).
The subpoena will be issued..."
"The European Union took a step toward opening its borders to vaccinated tourists, a move that likely means Americans and other non-Europeans will be allowed to visit the continent this summer.
The decision, taken Wednesday by ambassadors from the 27 EU member countries, must still be formally approved by national leaders, which could come as soon as tomorrow.
It isn’t yet clear exactly when tourists will be allowed to arrive, but it is expected to be very soon, an EU spokesman said.
The U.S. would need to be added to a list..."
"House Democrats forged ahead with President Joe Biden’s economic plans Tuesday after they broke a stalemate that threatened to unravel the party’s sprawling agenda.
In a 220-212 party-line vote, the chamber passed a $3.5 trillion budget resolution and advanced a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. The vote allows Democrats to write and approve a massive spending package without Republicans and puts the Senate-passed infrastructure plan on a path to final passage in the House.
The measure includes a nonbinding commitment to vote on the infrastructure bill by Sept. 27, which aims..."
"President Trump said Wednesday that he won’t release his tax returns while he’s under audit, setting the stage for a standoff among the White House, the Treasury Department and House Democrats.
“I would love to give them, but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for a trip to Texas.
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee set a Wednesday deadline for the Treasury Department to turn over six years worth of Trump’s personal and business tax..."
"The media face hard questions amid a growing acceptance that it is possible COVID-19 originated in a Chinese laboratory.
The idea was disparaged as a conspiracy theory by multiple outlets last year - almost surely because its loudest promoter was then-President Trump.
Now, as uncertainty grows, there are burgeoning suspicions that the media overstepped their mark.
For conservatives and some media critics, that's part of the larger issue of bias. 
They argue, for example, that mainstream outlets have played down the severity of the crisis at the southwestern border under..."
"WASHINGTON— Roger Stone was sentenced to three years and four months in prison on Thursday for lying to Congress and other crimes, after a tumultuous two weeks in which the government trial lawyers withdrew and President Trump repeatedly criticized the handling of the case.
Mr. Stone, a Republican consultant who has been a political adviser to Mr. Trump for decades, was sentenced to 40 months of incarceration, a $20,000 fine and two years of supervised release by Judge Amy Berman Jackson at a morning hearing in federal court in Washington,..."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, warned Pence’s lead Secret Service agent a day before the Capitol riot that Pence could be in danger on January 6 because Trump would publicly attack him for refusing to intervene in the election certification, the New York Times reported on Friday.
Short did not share with Pence’s Secret Service agent, Tim Giebels, what kind of security threat Pence might face when he met with Giebels in the West Wing, but the warning was the only time Short voiced a..."
"The recent flurry of court rulings legalizing and then halting gay marriage in Utah has whipsawed residents of this predominantly Mormon city, a conservative enclave that saw its first-ever gay pride celebration only last summer.
For same-sex couples here who say they endure stares and whispers while walking hand in hand, news that they could suddenly marry was almost unbelievable, said Todd Markham, who wed his partner, Addison Rose, during the brief 18-day window when same-sex marriages were allowed.
Meanwhile, city leaders here say they have been receiving emails and..."
"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.
In taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive action since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.
While the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it..."
"Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic during their debate on Wednesday, as the White House struggled to contain an outbreak that has infected President Donald Trump and dozens of others.
The policy-heavy, relatively sedate debate stood in stark contrast to last week’s chaotic presidential showdown between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, which was marred by Trump’s constant interruptions and personal insults from both men.
Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis, along with his age and that of Biden,..."
"Hillary Clinton will propose a sharp increase in the capital-gains tax rate for the highest earners for investments held only a few years, a campaign official said Friday.
Under the Clinton plan, investments held between one and two years would be taxed at the normal income-tax rate of 39.6%, nearly double the existing 20% capital gains rate. Neither figure counts an extra 3.8% tax on net investment income included as part of the health-care law, a campaign official said."
"In July 14 remarks in the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump made a series of false, misleading and unsupported statements about the novel coronavirus and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s position on it.We’ll examine the errors one by one.
Not a “travel ban.” First, as he repeatedly does, the president incorrectly describes the action that he took regarding travel from China, where the coronavirus was discovered last December. As we have previously reported, it wasn’t a “travel ban.”
On Jan. 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex..."
"Former President Donald Trump in a new lawsuit Monday asking that a federal judge appoint a special watchdog to review documents seized from his Florida home as part of a criminal investigation of the removal of White House records when he left office in January 2021.
Trump’s lawsuit, which suggests the Aug. 8 FBI raid was politically motivated, also asks that the Department of Justice be blocked from “further review of seized materials” from his Mar-a-Lago residence until the so-called special master is appointed to review the documents.
Special masters are appointed in criminal..."
"President Biden will travel to the U.K. on June 11-13 for the G7 summit, followed by a trip to Brussels on June 14 for the NATO summit, the White House announced Friday.
Why it matters: Biden's first overseas trip — which has been delayed due to the pandemic — will be used to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to multilateralism, following four years of strained relations with European allies under former President Trump.
What to watch: At the G7, hosted this year in Cornwall, England, Biden will ""work to advance key..."
"Four Democratic candidates will take the stage in New Hampshire on Wednesday to make a final pitch to voters ahead of the state's primary contest next week.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire Tom Steyer will participate in back-to-back town hall events hosted by CNN.
The cable news network will host a total of eight town halls with presidential candidates over the next two days at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. The events will kick off at 8 p.m...."
"CNN announced Friday it will host eight Democratic presidential town halls over a two-night period from New Hampshire ahead of the party's first primary slated for Feb. 11.
The network format has candidates appearing back-to-back on Feb. 5 and 6. Questions will come from either a CNN moderator or the audience at Saint Anselm College. Moderators will be announced at a later date.
""The audience will be comprised of invited New Hampshire Democrats and independents who say they will vote in the Democratic primary, as well as Saint..."
"In the latest Democratic effort to increase the tax bill for the super-wealthy, President Joe Biden is calling for a 20% minimum tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires in his new budget.
The “billionaire minimum income tax” is a new take on Biden’s recurring pledge to make the rich pay their “fair share.”
Instead of raising the pre-existing tax rates, this proposal would set a new floor to make sure households worth at least $100 million pay a 20% minimum — and the value of their untapped, unsold assets would all count as a..."
"President Vladimir Putin warned the United States in an interview broadcast on Sunday that Russia would strike new targets if the West supplied longer-range missiles to Ukraine for use in high-precision mobile rocket systems.
The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to Ukraine but Washington and its European allies have supplied weapons to Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles.
President Joe Biden last week said Washington would supply Ukraine with M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS,..."
"U.S. President-elect Joe Biden said on Thursday he would publicly take a coronavirus vaccine to demonstrate its safety to the public and pledged to retain the nation’s top adviser on the pandemic, Anthony Fauci, when he takes office next month. “People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work,” Biden told CNN in an interview that aired on Thursday.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, met with Biden’s advisers on the pandemic..."
"IMAGINE A POPULAR social network that takes privacy super seriously. By default, your posts are visible only to people in your real-life community. Not only does the company not use tracking cookies, but it promises it never will. It even announces that future changes to the privacy policy will be put to a vote by users before implementation.
It’s hard to imagine now, but such a social network once existed. It was called Facebook. The company’s journey from privacy-focused startup to mass surveillance platform is at the heart of the..."
"Title IX, the landmark 1972 legislation that barred sex discrimination in education and paved the way for a decadeslong women's sports boom, turns 50 today.
Why it matters: Before Title IX, 294,000 girls were participating in high school sports nationwide and just 15% of NCAA athletes were women. Today, those numbers are roughly 3.4 million and 44%, respectively.
That profound shift has contributed to the dominance of U.S. women at the Olympics: In Tokyo, American women would have finished fourth in the medal standings (66) if they were a country.
Women's soccer has been..."
"Evanston aldermen Monday evening approved the first expenditures in the city’s landmark municipal reparations program designed to compensate Black residents for codified discrimination.
Officials in the suburb say the initiative, which has been in the planning stages since 2019, is designed to address the discriminatory housing policies and practices faced by Black residents. The $10 million program — the first of its kind in the nation when approved in 2019 — will be funded through marijuana sales tax revenue along with some donations.
The specific measure approved Monday in an..."
"Leaders at the COP26 global climate conference in Glasgow have pledged to stop deforestation by the end of the decade and slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane to help slow climate change.
The inability of major powers so far to agree more broadly on rapid reductions in the use of fossil fuels, the main cause of manmade global warming, has upset the poorer, smaller countries likely to suffer its worst effects.

"The Trump campaign team sent out an email Thursday offering ""Let's Go Brandon"" T-shirts in return for any campaign donation of $45 or more. 
The email reads in part: ""You’ve probably heard it being chanted anywhere patriotic Americans get together. Well now, President Trump has put America’s favorite new phrase on a custom shirt. That’s right. President Trump has just authorized the release of his brand-new, limited-edition 'LET’S GO BRANDON' shirts.""
The email goes on to say that the T-shirt is in ""high demand,"" and is stated in the email as being ""low stock."" The email..."
"A Thursday attack outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 13 U.S. service members supporting Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.
Eleven Marines, one Navy corpsman and one soldier were “killed as the result of an enemy attack while supporting non-combatant evacuation operations,” according to a Saturday press release from the Department of Defense, which released the names of the U.S. troops.
The names were released 24 hours after families of the deceased were notified.
For the Marine Corps, the deceased are:

"A US judge has held former President Donald Trump in contempt for failing to turn over files for an investigation into his business practices.
Justice Arthur Engoron on Monday ordered Mr Trump pay a fine of $10,000 (£7,850) per day until he complies.
New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked the court to hold Mr Trump in contempt after he missed a March deadline to present certain documents."
"House Democrats passed their sweeping $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package in a party-line vote early Saturday morning, advancing President Biden’s top legislative priority.
Lawmakers passed the bill 219-212, with two Democrats — Reps. Jared Golden (Maine) and Kurt Schrader (Ore.) — joining all Republicans in voting against it. Democrats could afford up to four defections with their narrow House majority.
The bill's passage comes days after the COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. surpassed 500,000 people. More contagious virus variants remain a threat to containing the pandemic."
"After record-shattering daily COVID-19 counts, school boards in Florida's Hillsborough and Miami-Dade Counties held emergency meetings Wednesday and voted to again require face coverings on campuses.
Why it matters: The districts are the nation's fourth- and seventh-largest — representing more than 600,000 students.
They join Broward, Leon and Alachua Counties in openly defying Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Department of Education.
State of play: Hillsborough reported Wednesday that there were 1,840 confirmed cases among students and staff, and that 10,000 students and staff were quarantined.
A big change: Students had been allowed to..."
"Wednesday's House antitrust hearing with the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple went down some politically fraught rabbit holes, but also saw tech's most powerful figures face sharper questions than they've seen before from Washington.
What's happening: Republicans slammed the companies for alleged anti-conservative bias, but Democrats largely narrowed their focus to possible competitive abuses, putting the CEOs on their back feet and producing some surprising admissions.
Why it matters: The face-off is the culmination of a protracted conflict between Washington and Silicon Valley that has seen members of..."
"President Trump plans to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on U.S. soil, he said yesterday in an exclusive interview for ""Axios on HBO,"" a new four-part documentary news series debuting on HBO this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET/PT."
"The climate and low-carbon energy elements in President Joe Biden’s $1.75 trillion budget reconciliation framework would likely fall short of what is needed for the U.S. to meet its emissions reduction goals even though the proposal is poised to be the largest climate legislation in the nation’s history, experts said.
Before heading to Italy and then the United Kingdom for back-to-back summits on climate change, Biden presented the outline for climate and social safety net proposals as well as $2 trillion in offsets, including an international tax agreement, more IRS enforcement..."
"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon says it will give 5 million respirator masks and 2,000 ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services from the military’s strategic reserve in order to support the coronavirus response.
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Tuesday from the Pentagon press briefing room that 1 million respirator masks would be made available immediately.
Esper said the Pentagon is able to offer up to 2,000 deployable ventilators but that the machines are different from those used by civilians and will require training before operation. He..."
"The power of Donald Trump’s endorsement took a beating in Georgia's primaries as he failed to dislodge all of the Republican elected officials he targeted, including some he's publicly treated as sworn enemies.
Why it matters: Georgia was Ground Zero for Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. His struggle to elevate candidates in the state who loudly echo his lies about stolen elections cast doubt on the 2020 election's continued salience for GOP voters — and may presage his weakened lock on the party.
Top target Gov. Brian Kemp handily..."
"A federal judge has granted the request from former President Donald Trump’s legal team to appoint a special master to review the handling of classified documents seized during an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate on Aug. 8.
The decision by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon came despite the objections of the Justice Department, which said an outside legal expert was not necessary in part because officials had already completed their review of potentially privileged documents.
With Monday’s approval, the Trump legal team has scored at least one victory in its defense against the..."
"Congressional Democrats on Wednesday slammed President Trump for excluding them from a signing ceremony for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), an agreement for which they achieved significant changes and won union support.
""Perhaps we were not invited to today’s event on the South Lawn because our presence would be a prominent reminder of our critical leadership in achieving this deal,"" said Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee.
Democrats delivered strong bipartisan support for the deal in Congress after negotiating significant changes on labor enforcement,..."
"As the United States sees a sharp increase in immigration under President Joe Biden’s administration, the nation must respond from a place of principle — and Utah offers solid foundations from which to start.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this week directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist as 4,200 children were being kept in poor, crowded conditions in Customs and Border Protection facilities, in cells meant for adults. Biden, who criticized former President Donald Trump for keeping “kids in cages,” is passing the buck to his predecessor..."
"President Barack Obama on Friday said the world has to better coordinate and respond to outbreaks of diseases, noting that Ebola isn't the first deadly virus to cross borders and threaten global health and security.
""Each time, the world scrambles to coordinate a response,"" Mr. Obama said at the Global Health Security Summit in Washington, D.C. ""Each time, it's been harder than it should be to share information and to contain the outbreak. As a result, diseases have spread faster and farther than they should have, which means lives are..."
"As the House of Representatives prepares to give final approval to the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, a sizable majority of U.S. adults (70%) say they favor the legislation. Only about three-in-ten (28%) oppose the bill, which provides economic aid to businesses, individuals and state and local governments. While congressional votes on the legislation have been deeply divided along partisan lines, 41% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents support the measure. The bill draws overwhelming support from Democrats and Democratic leaners (94% favor). In assessing the proposed spending in..."
"Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) released a plan Monday to reopen the House amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The top House Republican, along with Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), the ranking GOP member of the Rules Committee, and Rep. Rodney Davis (Ill.), the ranking GOP member of the House Administration Committee, offered four strategies as part of the plan.
“This pandemic has claimed too many lives and livelihoods already. We must not allow the institution we are tasked with safeguarding to be the next,” the GOP members wrote.
The..."
"During the height of the virus outbreak, President Joe Biden’s administration authorized thousand dollar cash payments to create a TikTok “Influencer Army '' as part of the campaign to get people vaccinated. High school student Ellie Zeiler, a 17-year-old TikToker with over ten million followers, was approached by the White House with an interesting offer. Zeiler was requested to partake in a campaign to entice her followers and young people to get vaccinated.
About 50 Twitch streamers, YouTubers and TikTokers with large followings, including the popular 18-year-old star, Olivia Rodrigo,..."
"Former President Trump on Monday tore into Sen. Mike Rounds after the South Dakota Republican rejected Trump’s baseless claims about the 2020 presidential election. 
In a lengthy statement, Trump rehashed his false assertion that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud and vowed to withhold his support from Rounds the next time the South Dakota senator is up for reelection in 2026.
“Is he crazy or just stupid?” Trump said in the statement. “The numbers are conclusive, and the fraudulent and irregular votes are massive. The only reason he did this is because..."
"President Trump got a step closer to pulling America out of the Paris Climate Agreement by sending a withdrawal letter to the United Nations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in a statement Monday.
Driving the news: While Trump indicated this intention in June 2017, today marks the first day his administration could begin the formal process, which will be completed on Nov. 4, 2020 — a day after the 2020 presidential election.
Why it matters: While today is more procedural than symbolic in nature, the U.S. beginning the exit..."
"When U.S. schools begin the next academic year with the country still fighting the coronavirus pandemic, students should spend half their time in classrooms and half doing online activities that pinpoint their individual learning style such as videos or reading.
That advice comes from Nimish Mathur, 17, and his team from DuPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky.
The “I’m So Confused Gang” team submitted its idea for re-opening school in the age of COVID-19 to a competition sponsored by Discover Your Genius (DYG), a nonprofit company that challenges young..."
"A new joint effort made up of NATO member states, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and Japan is coming together to confront the global threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks.
In its first action on Monday, the countries will publicly blame China’s Ministry of State Security for a massive cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange email servers earlier this year.
The attack was carried out by criminal contract hackers working for the MSS who also engage in cyber-enabled extortion, cryptojacking and ransomware, the official said."
"Despite serious supply problems in the market, oil prices crashed on Tuesday morning due to renewed recession fears and the prospect of demand destruction.
Whilst most of 2022 could only be characterized as a period of hardship for Europe’s embattled industries, things are about to get even worse as Russian pipeline supply falls and power prices across the continent soared. 
- Day-ahead prices in Italy and France have soared above €400 per MWh, with Germany trending slightly lower – attesting to the tightness, annual 2023 forward prices are only marginally..."
"A jury ruled Thursday that actor Kevin Spacey was not liable for battery against Anthony Rapp, according to multiple reports.
Driving the news: The case was born during the early days of the #MeToo movement during which the former ""House of Cards"" actor was fired from the Netflix series.
The jury made its ruling after about an hour of deliberation, per multiple reports.
Details: Rapp alleged that Spacey made a sexual advance on Rapp in 1986 after a party when the two were relatively unknown actors who had become friends on Broadway, Axios previously reported."
"The origin of the novel coronavirus is still unclear and the theory that it was caused by a laboratory leak needs to be taken seriously until there is a rigorous data-led investigation that proves it wrong, a group of leading scientists said.
COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, has killed 3.34 million people, cost the world trillions of dollars in lost income and upended normal life for billions of people.
""More investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic,"" said the 18 scientists, including Ravindra..."
"President Trump claimed in a late-night tweet that he was not briefed on intelligence about a Russian unit offering bounties on American service members in Afghanistan because the U.S. intelligence community deemed the information not credible.
Trump also suggested that details of the intelligence, first reported by The New York Times on Friday, may have been fabricated by the media in order to “make Republicans look bad.”
“Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP,”..."
"The House Intelligence Committee will begin reviewing a report Monday on its investigation into President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, a committee official confirmed to The Hill.
The committee is then expected to consider and adopt the report Tuesday evening. The report and any minority views will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which could draft articles of impeachment against the president in the next few weeks, according to Politico.
This is a major event, moving impeachment proceedings one step closer to a possible impeachment trial in the Senate."
"President Donald Trump will unveil an executive order on Thursday aimed at strengthening the Medicare health program for seniors, seeking to improve its fiscal position and offer more affordable plan options, administration officials said.
The order, which Trump will discuss during a visit to a retirement community in Florida known as the Villages, is the Republican president’s answer to some Democrats who are arguing for a broad and expensive expansion of Medicare to cover all Americans, proposals that Republicans reject.
It follows measures rolled out in recent months by the..."
"In an unprecedented move, Columbus police showed body camera footage of the shooting of a 16-year-old girl by a Columbus police officer just hours after the incident on the Southeast Side.
The shooting, which happened about 20 minutes before a guilty verdict was announced in the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd, prompted hundreds to protest at the shooting site and Downtown."
"Forget about Santa Claus. As the holidays approach, millions of people around the world will participate in their own holiday traditions. Instead of hanging stockings on the mantle or drinking eggnog around a fire watching holiday movies, there are other whacky traditions that people in different cultures partake in."
"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reportedly approved a roughly $5 billion settlement with Facebook following its investigation into the company's handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the largest the FTC has ever imposed for privacy violations.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported Friday that the FTC voted along party lines this week to approve the settlement, closing the investigation into the Cambridge Analytica incident.
The vote was 3-2, with Republicans in the majority approving the deal, according to the Journal."
"After the deadliest school shooting in nearly a decade, lawmakers are making emotional pleas for stricter gun control legislation. ""What are we doing?"" an impassioned Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on the Senate floor on Tuesday after an attack at a Texas elementary school killed at least 19 children and two adults.
The big picture: There's a familiar pattern. In the wake of a mass shooting, Congress zeroes in on gun and other relevant legislation, but Republicans won't support most new gun laws and Democrats don't have 50 senators who are willing to ditch the..."
"As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is becoming clear: How can the United States manage two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great powers (Russia and China) simultaneously? The answer, according to many politicians and defense experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in Europe to focus on the greater threat posed by China in the Indo-Pacific.
This would be a mistake.
The United States remains the world’s leading power with global interests, and it cannot afford..."
"Rounding out a week of visits with technology company executives and potential 2016 donors in California, Sen. Rand Paul told Republicans Friday night that the GOP would continue to lose California and other states on the West Coast if it did not adopt a more welcoming attitude toward Latinos and make a more appealing pitch to black voters through issues like school choice and education reform."
"US President Joe Biden approved the deployment of additional forces in eastern Europe, US media reported on Wednesday.
Under the plan, the US will reportedly send about 2,000 American troops to Poland and Germany, while 1,000 troops would move from Germany to Romania.
The troops in Poland will be put on high-readiness, according to DW correspondent Teri Schultz."
"Borrowers anxiously awaiting the federal student loan relief application say the beta version that was released this weekend couldn’t have been simpler.
“It was a real quick and easy process,” says Glenn Gallimore, a 42-year-old living in Arizona with just over $21,000 in student loans left to repay. He estimates it took about two minutes to fill out.
The Biden administration released a test version of its long-awaited federal student loan forgiveness application Friday night. It requires a borrower’s full name, date of birth, Social Security number, and attestation that..."
"The White House on Monday hit back at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after he took a swipe at President Joe Biden in a series of tweets over the weekend for his comments on inflation.
The exchange began Friday when Biden tweeted, without directly referring to Amazon: “You want to bring down inflation? Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.”"
"Senate negotiators said Sunday they reached a bipartisan framework on measures intended to limit some access to firearms, paving the way for the broadest federal legislation on guns in decades.
The proposal, after weeks of push and pull in the wake of mass shootings last month at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket and a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school, is narrower than what many Democrats had sought. It aims to go after illegal sales of guns and to fund mental-health programs and school security. It also provides incentives for states to implement and maintain so-called red-flag laws and includes juvenile..."
"Donald Trump is undergoing a campaign pivot, but it doesn’t have anything to do with his remarks Thursday night that he regretted some of his statements (he left unspecified which) over the course of his raucous year-long campaign. Trump’s semi-apology set political pundits abuzz, but the most notable change in Trump’s rhetoric in recent weeks has really been his direct and repeated appeals towards African-Americans. It’s a shift that began before the Republican presidential nominee’s latest campaign shakeup—bringing in Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon Wednesday and parting ways with Paul..."
"Everyone who cares knows that recessions happen when there are two consecutive quarters of negative growth — everyone, that is, except for the people who actually decide when the economy is in recession.
For those folks, at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the definition of recession is much squishier.
Officially, the NBER defines recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” The bureau’s economists, in fact, profess not even to utilize gross domestic product, the broadest measure of..."
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.—President Trump called U.S. troops deployed around the world to offer holiday greetings on Christmas Eve, saying they were “tremendous warriors” who have “kept the Taliban running scared.”
“You’re tremendous warriors, and we appreciate it so much,” Mr. Trump told members of the military over a video teleconference from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “You kept the Taliban running scared. You are incredible people.”
The president’s comments come after the Pentagon announced Monday the death of a U.S. service member in Afghanistan. This year has seen at..."
"The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 17-month low last week, pointing to another month of robust job growth, though surging COVID-19 infections pose a risk to the labor market recovery.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state jobless rolls dropped in early August to levels last seen in mid-March 2020, when the economy almost ground to a halt amid mandatory business closures aimed..."
"Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed on Tuesday that the chamber would take up measures to combat gun violence in the wake of a shooting at a grocery store in Colorado that left 10 people dead.
""The Senate is going to debate and address the epidemic of gun violence in this country,"" Schumer said during floor speech.
“We have a lot of work to do. I’ve already committed to bringing universal background checks legislation to the floor of the Senate. There is a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary..."
"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The chemicals that went up in flames in Beirut’s deadliest peace-time explosion arrived in the Lebanese capital seven years ago on a leaky Russian-leased cargo ship that, according to its captain, should never have stopped there.
“They were being greedy,” said Boris Prokoshev, who was captain of the Rhosus in 2013 when he says the owner told him to make an unscheduled stop in Lebanon to pick up extra cargo.
Prokoshev said the ship was carrying 2,750 tonnes of a highly combustible chemical from Georgia to Mozambique..."
"Ghislaine Maxwell's brother, Ian, has said he doubts his sister will get a fair hearing at her trial on sex trafficking and other charges which is due to start next week.
Ms Maxwell, the daughter of the late media mogul Robert Maxwell, has been accused of trafficking minors for her former lover Jeffrey Epstein.
She has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July 2020.
The former socialite has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
""I think my sister's probably relieved finally that it is starting because..."
"Americans are most likely to name President Donald Trump and Michelle Obama as most admired man and woman in 2020. Trump tied former President Barack Obama for the honor last year but edged out his predecessor this year. Trump's first-place finish ends a 12-year run as most admired man for Obama, tied with Dwight Eisenhower for the most ever.
Meanwhile, Michelle Obama ranks as most admired woman for the third year in a row. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is second."
"Cost relief may be coming for Medicare recipients who use insulin. But a proposed $35 monthly cap for those with private insurance is no longer part of the Senate’s Inflation Relief Act, which goes before the House on Friday.
The cost of insulin, which is used by people with diabetes to control their blood sugar, has become a political issue, with politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders decrying how much Americans pay compared to people in other countries.
The highest cost for insulin is borne by those who pay for insulin themselves,..."
"Medicare is poised to renegotiate the prices of some of its most expensive drugs through a historic expansion of its power, which could reduce costs for many seniors as well as federal spending on its prescription drug plan.
The changes are tucked inside a massive spending-and-tax bill in Congress that includes $433 billion in investments in health-care and clean energy. House Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act on Friday in a 220 to 207 vote along party lines, ending a tortured legislative process that took more than a year.
The..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he'll move ahead on approving rules for President Trump's Senate trial without negotiating them with Democrats.
Between the lines: Senate Republicans' comments on Tuesday suggested that they've fallen in line with McConnell's position that the rules should be based on Bill Clinton's 1999 Senate trial, where the question of whether to call witnesses was postponed until after the start of the trial.
Many of these senators have said they're comfortable following the precedent of the Clinton trial, in which senators first gave..."
"White, working-class voters in eastern Arkansas for years backed Democratic candidates, among them Bill Clinton and outgoing Gov. Mike Beebe, but have moved sharply toward Republicans in recent elections.
Now, as the 2016 election takes shape, some of Hillary Clinton ’s allies are trumpeting her potential as a presidential candidate to bring these voters back to the Democratic Party and to run competitively in a handful of states, including Arkansas, that have spurned President Barack Obama .
But even here, where"
"Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday defended President Trump's record in the wake of two mass shootings in which dozens of people were killed in less than 24 hours.
""This is a serious problem — there's no question about it — but they are sick, sick people, and the president knows it,"" Mulvaney said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I don't think it's fair to try and lay this at the feet of the president."""
"Senate Democrats voted on Thursday to take up a sweeping $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill, teeing off what's expected to be a days-long sprint to pass the legislation.
The Senate voted 50-50 to proceed to the coronavirus relief legislation, with Vice President Harris breaking the tie to advance the bill. “The Senate is going to move forward with the bill. No matter how long it takes, the Senate is going to stay in session to finish the bill this week,” Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said from the Senate..."
"A divided and cautious Supreme Court on Tuesday probed whether states barring same-sex marriage are violating a right for gay couples, hearing extended arguments on one of the most direct constitutional issues to cross its docket in recent memory.
Justices, speaking at arguments that lasted 2½ hours, questioned whether they should require all 50 states to recognize same-sex unions or allow sta"
"A trial investigating the drug hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment against Covid-19 may never find out if it's effective, say scientists involved.
Controversy around the drug - touted by President Trump and the subject of online misinformation - is stopping completion of the trial, they say.
It is ineffective in hospitalised patients, but investigators hope it might work if given earlier on.
Hospitals have pulled out of the trial.
The Oxford University-led trial is aiming to enrol 40,000 frontline workers around the world.
Investigators hope the large-scale, double-blind randomised study..."
"Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said that shooter Dylann Roof hijacked the meaning of the Confederate flag when, in 2017, he attacked a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., in an interview with The Blaze.
What she's saying: ""People saw [the Confederate flag] as service, and sacrifice and heritage,"" Haley said, adding, ""the national media came in droves — they wanted to define what happened. They wanted to make this about racism. They wanted to make it about gun control. They wanted to make it about the death penalty."""
"President Donald Trump said he will introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has long protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook, an extraordinary attempt to intervene in the media that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny.
Trump signed an executive order on Thursday afternoon after attacking Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.
Trump said we may “remove or change” a law kown as section 230 through legislation so..."
"U.S. shoppers accelerated their level of spending in October even as the prices of goods jumped at their fastest pace since the 1990s, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
Retail sales, a measure of how much consumers spent on goods ranging across categories from autos to sporting goods and food and gas, increased 1.7% for October, compared with 0.8% the previous month.
Excluding autos, sales also increased 1.7%, according to the Census Bureau advance estimate.
The two numbers were above the Dow Jones estimates of 1.5% for the headline print and 1%..."
"Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine testifies Friday in the second round of public impeachment hearings before the House Intelligence Committee. She’s the only witness appearing on Friday.
She has said in a prior closed-door session that she was the victim of a smear campaign by President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and that the president personally pressured the State Department to remove her from her role, according to a transcript of that hearing.
She said the deputy secretary of State had told her in April after..."
"“Captain Ukraine,” the first “true” president of Ukraine, a hero, a leader. I would have never thought I would see people use these terms to refer to Volodymyr Zelensky.
Back in 2019, I did not vote for him. Like some other Ukrainians, I did not believe Zelensky, a comedian, actor and entertainer with no experience in politics, was suited for the job. His campaign was idealistic but lacked substance. He was often vague and raised concerns about where he stood toward Russia. He had his own powerful backer, the billionaire who owned the TV..."
"The Senate on Wednesday voted to nix President Biden’s vaccine mandate for larger businesses, handing Republicans a symbolic win.
Senators voted 52-48 on the resolution, which needed a simple majority to be approved. Democratic Sens. Jon Tester (Mont.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) voted with Republicans, giving it enough support to be sent to the House. 
The resolution faces an uphill path in the House, where Republicans aren’t able to use a similar fast-track process to force a vote over the objections of Democratic leadership. Instead, Republicans are hoping to get the simple majority needed to force a..."
"New York police officers filmed restraining an unarmed black man until he stopped breathing will not be charged over his death, officials say.
Daniel Prude, who had mental health issues, died in Rochester city after officers put him in ""spit hood"" designed to protect police.
The death in March last year led to days of protests against police.
On Tuesday, New York's attorney general said a grand jury had declined to indict any officers in the case.
""I know that the Prude family, the Rochester community and communities across the..."
"A second South Dakota tribal leader called for the removal of the four sculptures on Mount Rushmore, which is carved into land sacred to the Lakota Sioux.
""Nothing stands as a greater reminder to the Great Sioux Nation of a country that cannot keep a promise or treaty than the faces carved into our sacred land on what the United States calls Mount Rushmore,” Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Harold Frazier said in a statement, according to USA Today.
Frazier also criticized President Trump’s and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s..."
"Former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) has ended his primary campaign against President Trump for the Republican Party's 2020 presidential nomination, after receiving just one percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.
Walsh announced the end of his longshot campaign on CNN's ""New Day.""
""I am ending my candidacy for president of the United States,"" he told CNN's John Berman. ""I got into this because I thought it was really important that there was a Republican — a Republican — out there every day calling out this president for..."
"One of President Trump’s few Republican challengers in the 2020 presidential race has dropped out — but not without a few parting shots.
Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) ended his presidential bid on CNN Friday morning, and said he would be throwing all of his support toward the eventual Democratic candidate, as “any Democrat would be better than Trump in the White House.”"
"U.S. federal officials on Tuesday agreed to send states additional coronavirus vaccine doses requested by several governors, as the country tries to ramp up the pace of inoculations with the daily COVID-19 death toll hovering at 3,200.
Officials also recommended that states broaden vaccination eligibility to people as young as 65 or who have other chronic health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe COVID-19, drawing a mixed reaction from states that have tailored their inoculation priorities differently.
Releasing additional vaccine was called for last week by President-elect Joe Biden’s..."
"Flooding killed at least nine people, swept away cars, submerged subway lines and grounded flights in New York and New Jersey as the remnants of Hurricane Ida brought torrential rains to the area.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described the flooding and weather on Wednesday night as a ""historic weather event,"" and the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency in New York City for the first time.
Recovery efforts were underway early on Thursday to bring back transportation systems serving millions of residents in the densely..."
"When Koray Camgöz was granted a four-day workweek, the benefits seemed numerous. The new schedule forced the London-based PR officer to organise his time better. He was still able to meet deadlines and stay on top of to-do lists, while enjoying an extra day off each week. Most importantly, for the recent father, he was able to spend more time with his child. 
His day off rotated between Tuesdays and Wednesdays. In an always-on environment, he still had to be on call for emergencies on his day off, and also..."
"Got a strong opinion on how to vote in this year’s presidential election? You’re not alone.
Here’s a range of op-eds written by people from throughout the political spectrum, making various cases for why you should (or shouldn’t) vote for either President Donald Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
(These are all opinion articles and don’t necessarily align with the overall philosophy or AllSides Media Bias Rating of the outlet that published them.)"
"Sales of new U.S. single-family homes plunged to a 6-1/2-year low in July as persistently high mortgage rates and house prices further eroded affordability.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday added to a stream of weak housing data, and suggested that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening campaign to slow the economy in order to tame inflation was achieving some desired results in the housing market. But with house prices remaining elevated amid a critical shortage of previously owned properties, a total housing market collapse is unlikely."
"Afghanistan's Taliban on Monday freed American engineer Mark Frerichs in exchange for Taliban-linked Afghan tribal leader Bashir Noorzai, after President Joe Biden granted clemency to the convicted drug smuggler who had been detained by the United States since 2005, officials said.
Frerichs, an engineer abducted in 2020 while working in Afghanistan, was exchanged at Kabul airport for Noorzai, acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi told a news conference.
Biden said Frerichs' release was the culmination of work by U.S. officials and other governments. His administration has been under pressure from..."
"As Democrats convene for one of the most important political conventions in history, they are as strong as the Rock of Gibraltar, as noble as the ideals of Mount Rushmore, and as united as previous generations of Democrats who nominated the great Democratic presidents of American history.
While the conventions this year are unlike any others, in large measure because of a Republican president whose negligence has allowed a deadly virus to spread across our country and bring economic pain to Americans across our land, in the most critical way..."
"The Senate passed legislation to extend health and disability benefits to millions of veterans exposed to toxic burn pits in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas of military engagement.
The 86-11 vote came after Republicans blocked the legislation last week, with a number of the lawmakers having previously supported it when it came before the Senate in June.
Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for the veterans, blasted the opposition, speaking at rallies on Capitol Hill multiple times over the past week and making a series of media appearances on network Sunday shows, Fox News and..."
"President Joe Biden got some facts wrong and spun others in a Feb. 16 town hall that aired on CNN.
He said it was “not true” that he had revised his 100-day school reopening goal, saying it “was reported” that he meant a majority of schools only need to be open one day a week. That’s exactly what his press secretary had said.
Biden left the false impression that the preceding administration had contracted for fewer COVID-19 vaccines than it actually had.
The president wrongly claimed that Federally Qualified Health..."
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) defeated a Republican-backed effort to remove him, AP projected on Tuesday night.
Why it matters, via Axios' Margaret Talev: Tuesday's results highlight the limits of Republicans trying to use Trump tactics in a deeply Democratic state.
The campaign of Larry Elder — a conservative radio show host and Black Republican who has embraced Trump and anti-COVID vaccine rhetoric — in particular may have done more to help Newsom than hurt him by motivating Democrats to cast their ballots.
What he's saying: Newsom thanked Californians at a news conference for ""overwhelmingly"" voting ""no"" in the..."
"The death on Saturday of Michael Brown, 18, has sparked two nights of unrest.
""To become violent in Michael Brown's name is to betray the gentle giant he was,"" said the Revered Al Sharpton, flanked by Mr Brown's parents.
The FBI and the US justice department's civil rights division have opened an investigation into the shooting."
"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday defended President Trump's retweet a day earlier in which the president shared a video of a man in Florida shouting ""white power,"" saying he did so to stand up for his supporters.
""The president did not hear that phrase in that portion of the video, and when it was signaled to him that this was in there he took that tweet down,"" McEnany told ""Fox & Friends.""
""But he made very clear to me that he stands with the people of The..."
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday formally launches what may be an uphill battle to persuade voters to give him four more years in office, as he bets a strong U.S. economy will outweigh voter concerns about his unorthodox style and polarizing policies.
At an evening rally in Orlando, Florida, Trump, who has long made it known he is running for re-election, will begin making his case with gusto for a second term.
The Trump of 2020 most certainly will bear a strong resemblance to the Trump of 2016 - brash..."
"Democratic lawmakers plan to introduce legislation on Thursday that would add four seats to the Supreme Court, an initiative that has slim hopes of passage but reflects progressives’ impatience with President Biden’s cautious approach toward overhauling a court that turned to the right during the Trump administration.
Last week, Mr. Biden signed an executive order establishing a 36-member commission to report back within six months on possible changes to the Supreme Court’s membership, jurisdiction and lifetime terms. Mr. Biden appointed former Obama White House Counsel Bob Bauer and Yale law..."
"Labor Day is a holiday to honor hard working Americans, and small business owners are among the hardest workers around. They are often the first ones in and the last ones out. They toil and sweat beside their employees on the same job site, under the same tough conditions, behind the same counter or in the same office."
"A police chief accused of botching the response to the fatal shooting of 19 schoolchildren and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, has been sacked.
The local school board voted unanimously to fire Pete Arredondo, who had been on leave since June.
His lawyers said in a written statement that he had been unaware anyone was inside the classrooms with the shooter.
The firing came three months to the day since the attack and two weeks before the new school term begins.
The attack at Robb Elementary School on 24 May..."
"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused China of “irresponsible steps” on Saturday by halting key communication channels with Washington, and said its Taiwan actions showed a move from prioritising peaceful resolution towards use of force.
His comments came as Chinese aircraft and warships practised on Saturday for an attack on Taiwan, island officials said, part of a raft of steps taken by Beijing after a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this week.
China’s retaliation in stopping bilateral processes in eight key areas including defence, narcotics, transnational..."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has described an attack on a maternity and children's hospital as a ""war crime"".
It may not seem like it, but ""even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it.
These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements.
What is a war crime?
Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival.
Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as..."
"As a Virginia Senate committee debated how to craft a policy allowing police to take guns away from people deemed dangerous, one Republican made an ominous warning about what could happen if the state starts sending officers up “Ruby Ridge Drive” to bang on the door.
“When they don’t answer the door,” said Sen. Ben Chafin, R-Russell, “… is this committee asking that that door be knocked down to find out what’s on the other side?”
It’s not clear how many of Chafin’s colleagues share his concern about the bill’s..."
"Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has told senators that the federal minimum wage increase President Joe Biden and Democrats have been seeking would violate the chamber's rules for inclusion in a filibuster-proof pandemic relief reconciliation bill.
Two sources familiar with the discussions confirmed the ruling, which emerged after arguments from aides to both parties in closed-door meetings with MacDonough this week.
The decision dealt a blow to Democratic hopes of tacking the long-sought rise in the minimum wage onto the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that's taking shape. While the provision..."
"The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission on Monday announced charges against Kim Kardashian for promoting a cryptocurrency without disclosing that she had been paid for the promotion. Kardashian has agreed to pay $1.26 million as part of a settlement.
The big picture: Federal securities regulators have been cracking down on celebrity crypto endorsements.
Details: Kardashian didn't disclose that she was paid $250,000 to publish an Instagram post about a crypto token called EMAX, in which Kardashian included a link to a related website and instructions for potential investors.
Under terms of the settlement, Kardashian agreed..."
"In his first press conference from Kabul, a Taliban spokesperson said Tuesday the group would honor women's rights and an independent media, but within the ""frameworks"" of Islamic law.
The big picture: The Taliban's swift takeover has renewed fears that the group will return to the brutal grip it ruled with in the 1990s, when women's freedoms were severely restricted, other human rights were limited and executions were carried out in public.
The Taliban now insist they have changed, but will still rule Afghanistan within the norms of Islamic law.
What..."
"A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell to 20 years in prison for what prosecutors said was a decadelong scheme to help disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.
Before being sentenced, Ms. Maxwell spoke to a packed Manhattan courtroom that included some of the dozens of women who have accused her of exploiting them. She called Epstein, her onetime boyfriend, a manipulative, cunning and controlling man who fooled all those in his orbit.
“It is the greatest regret of my life that I ever met Jeffrey Epstein,” she said...."
"Today is Joe Biden’s 47th full day as president, and he has yet to hold a solo press conference.
This is becoming a big deal in some circles.
Biden has made announcements, answered a few questions from reporters here and there at events, sat for several one-on-one interviews and did a CNN town hall. But no solo press conferences.
And the complaints are growing louder.
The Associated Press’ Zeke Miller, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, told AP reporters Jonathan Lemire and Alexandra Jaffe, “Press conferences are critical to..."
"If you're actively searching for a way to constructively contribute to the resolution of the coronavirus pandemic, you could consider volunteering for a coronavirus vaccine study. By taking part in a vaccine trial, you'd be a major player in moving science forward so the world can finally get a grip on the virus that's been overloading hospitals, taking lives and forcing lockdowns for more than six months now.
With more than 10 million cases worldwide and more than half a million deaths, it's clear that we need an intervention...."
"House Democrats are split over how to approach what they mostly agree is a clear conflict of interest for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
Why it matters: Thomas has thus far resisted calls to recuse himself from election-related cases amid revelations about the activism of his wife, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, before the Jan. 6 insurrection. One remedy would be impeachment — a long shot, as well as a rarity in the nation's history.
State of play: While progressive Democrats like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) are already talking about impeachment, party leaders..."
"The Supreme Court will hear oral argument on Nov. 1 in a pair of cases challenging the Texas law that bans nearly all abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy. In two orders issued on Friday afternoon, the court granted requests by the Biden administration and a group of Texas abortion providers to leap-frog proceedings in the court of appeals, but it allowed the law to remain in effect for now — a decision that drew a stinging dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
The two orders suggest that the court will not directly..."
"Monday marks April 18, the annual tax deadline and a unique day for citizens of our nation. On behalf of the employees of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), I want to thank everyone for taking the time to file and pay their taxes. This civic duty is important to our great nation in many ways, by funding critical needs essential to our democracy on issues ranging from schools and roads to defense. The IRS collects about $4.1 trillion a year, about 96 percent of the U.S. gross revenue."
"European countries say they will ramp up security around oil and gas installations after the suspected sabotage of two major pipelines.
The EU, US and Nato have suggested damage to the pipelines between Russia and Germany was deliberate, but have not blamed Russia directly.
Russia has said it was not involved, and asked if the US was instead.
Russia has previously been accused of using gas supplies as a weapon against the West over its support for Ukraine.
The leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a stage and showered each other with praise on Sunday at a “Howdy, Modi!” rally attended by upward of 50,000 people, a rare mass showing for a foreign leader on American soil.
Trump, calling the gathering a “profoundly historic event,” was greeted with a standing ovation by the Indian-American crowd and his speech was interrupted several times by roars of approval."
"In November 2016, I wrote an open letter requesting that gun owners not bring firearms into our stores, offices, or facilities, even in states where it’s permitted by law. This was following an incident in one of our stores in which a customer accidentally shot and injured himself while trying on a pair of jeans. While that was bad, it could have been worse: The bullet could have killed him, another customer, or one of our employees."
"Just a few hours after we published this article, Democratic Rep. Alan Lowenthal of California announced his retirement from the House.
With Lowenthal’s retirement, 20 House Democrats have now announced they will not seek reelection in 2022, compared with 11 Republicans. Although California has not completed its redistricting process, Lowenthal represents a heavily Democratic district around Long Beach, so unless he ended up facing another incumbent Democrat, he likely wouldn’t have had much trouble winning reelection. But with Republicans favored to take back the House next year, Lowenthal might have decided..."
"Rose McGowan has said that Democrats are in a ""deep cult"" in an appearance on Fox News.
The outspoken actress and #MeToo advocate discussed being able to recognize a cult having grown up in one herself, in comments that were labeled ""disturbing"" by critics.
""I am not here to make people feel bad about their political choices,"" she told host Tammy Bruce on Fox News Primetime on Monday night. ""But I am here to say that you might be in a cult too if you don't know the signs. And..."
"A federal judge in California on Monday reinstated a ban on a Trump administration policy that would restrict migrants’ ability to apply for asylum at the southern border.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar had issued a nationwide injunction in July blocking the rule, which would make most asylum-seekers who pass through another country before reaching the U.S. ineligible for asylum, with exceptions for victims of trafficking and migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through.
The rule would primarily effect Central American immigrants crossing through Mexico."
"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a series of memos to his colleagues on the nation’s highest court urging them not to take up recent cases on Louisiana abortion regulations and Democratic subpoenas for President Trump’s financial records, CNN reported Wednesday.
The justice recommended his colleagues avoid ruling on the merits of the Louisiana law, a case viewed by both pro- and anti-abortion rights groups as the high court’s first chance to revisit the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision since President Trump appointed Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch to..."
"Two men were arrested and charged with assaulting U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died following the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.
The two men — Julian Elie Khater, 32, of Pennsylvania, and George Pierre Tanios, 39, of West Virginia — were both arrested Sunday, the Justice Department said. They each face nine counts related to the Capitol attack, including the assault of Sicknick and two other federal agents with a chemical irritant.
That charge — assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon — carries a maximum of..."
"A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause ""unconstitutional chaos"" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday.
The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy.
Texas' ban has so far survived legal challenges partly because..."
"Congress returns on Monday with Democrats aiming to revive central pieces of President Biden’s stalled economic agenda while trying to keep on track a separate, bipartisan bill targeted at boosting competitiveness with China that top Republicans are threatening to block.
House Democrats also are set to roll out legislation responding to the Supreme Court ruling ending federal abortion protections. The push could include legislation to write into law the right to an abortion before fetal viability, as well as a bill intended to block any state attempts to criminalize travel for the purpose of getting an..."
"These numbers are not accurate. The average price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in June 2008 was $134, not $181.58. In March 2022, it was $108, not $99.76. Gas prices were $4.05 in June 2008 and $4.22 in March 2022. So the markup on gasoline has increased modestly since 2008, but not nearly as much as this tweet suggests.
Even so, Rashid’s tweet has racked up 18,000 retweets. As of publication time, it’s still on Twitter.
Tweets like this one are on my mind as I think about Twitter’s Monday announcement that it had accepted..."
"US President Donald Trump has been accused of racism after posting tweets attacking Democratic congresswomen.
He claimed the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"", before suggesting they ""go back"".
He then said Speaker ""Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements""."
"U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday strongly condemned what she said were ""illegal"" border attacks by Azerbaijan on Armenia, using a visit to the Russian ally to pledge American support for its sovereignty.
Pelosi cast her trip to Armenia, a sliver of land the size of U.S. state of Maryland that is wedged between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey and Iran, as an attempt to strengthen support for what she cast as a beacon of democracy.
Speaking in the ancient city of Yerevan, Pelosi said her trip had significance..."
"Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced Saturday she would work to overturn Trump Administration's new rule rolling back LGBT patients' protections in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
""The Trump Administration's decision to eliminate protections for transgender patients is simply wrong. I'll work to overturn this discriminatory policy,"" Collins tweeted."
"President-elect Joe Biden said Monday that he hoped the Senate would “bifurcate” its work so that an impeachment trial of President Trump does not interfere with confirming his Cabinet nominees or passing a stimulus package.
Biden said that he had spoken with the Senate parliamentarian about whether the upper chamber can “go a half day with the impeachment and a half day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate as well as moving on the [coronavirus stimulus] package.” He said he had yet to receive an answer on..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied a New York Times report that U.S. officials were discussing a military plan to send up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East to counter any attack or nuclear weapons acceleration by Iran.
“I think it’s fake news, OK? Now, would I do that? Absolutely. But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we’re not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that,” Trump told reporters..."
"House and Senate leadership announced on Monday that they plan to attach a proposal to raise the debt ceiling through Dec. 2022 to a short-term, government funding bill. The bill must pass before the end of the month or Congress risks a shutdown.
Why it matters: Democrats are taking a huge risk by trying to force through an increase of the debt limit in its must-pass funding bill. The move is wishful thinking on behalf of Democrats who are hoping they can get at least 10 centrist Republicans to balk, as..."
"Thirty five Senate seats are up for reelection in November, but only eight are considered toss-ups, according to RealClearPolitics. Of those, there are three that are most likely to determine which party controls the Senate, according to research firm Beacon Policy Advisors.
In a report released Friday, Beacon predicted “the likely tipping point race to be Georgia, a purple state that is still to the right of the nation by about three points.”
The incumbent senator, Democrat Raphael Warnock, defeated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a special runoff election last year..."

"When Vladimir Putin began his invasion six months ago, Ukrainians defiantly tallied each night their defenses had held. Now, Ukraine and its western backers are contemplating how far ahead the fighting could still stretch.
The big picture: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday he would not agree to freeze the conflict where it stands, with Russia occupying one-fifth of his country. Putin too seems intent on pressing on despite his own enormous losses.
Some analysts believe Putin would prefer a conflict that rumbles on indefinitely, with Ukraine divided and no clear ending.
Zelensky also urged against war..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new COVID-19 guidance Thursday, loosening recommendations that have been in place since the onset of the pandemic.
Why it matters: The shift marks a significant change in how the nation deals with COVID-19 more than two years after the pandemic began. A majority of Americans are now fully vaccinated against the virus or have been exposed to it.
Be smart: The CDC is now putting more of an emphasis on personal choices to make informed decisions to protect oneself and others from severe illness, including by vaccination..."
"Amazon's worldwide consumer CEO Dave Clark has offered to help the Biden administration with its coronavirus vaccination goals by mobilizing efforts to inoculate its employees, according to a letter sent to President Biden on Wednesday.
Why it matters: As demand for the coronavirus vaccine is outstripping supply, Amazon has about 800,000 employees, many of whom are essential workers. The Biden administration wants to vaccinate 100 million Americans in 100 days.
Amazon also offered up any technologies, communications and personnel to the White House to help move along tracking and vaccinations."
"The leak of a U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn the constitutional right to abortion is a major breach of confidentiality that has heightened the stakes in an already politically-charged case, experts say.
Politico on Monday night published a draft majority opinion that it had obtained striking down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which guaranteed the right to abortion nationwide. It was a sign that the court’s 6-3 conservative majority was ready to flex its muscle.
While the substance of the draft sparked praise from anti-abortion..."
"Joe Biden's presidency was meant to be defined by calm, experienced competence. Yet just nine months into his term, he has been teetering on the brink of failure. Vicious infighting within his own party has threatened to torpedo his ambitious domestic agenda, encapsulated in two sprawling pieces of legislation that Democrats have not yet been able to vote out of Congress. Even before the bickering over the bills, Biden's claim to competence, based on more than 40 years in Washington, had been shredded by a calamitous exit from Afghanistan and an ongoing crisis..."
"US Attorney General William Barr has assigned a senior federal prosecutor to examine the origins of the Russia investigation, media reports say.
John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, has reportedly been asked to determine whether the collection of intelligence on the Trump campaign was lawful.
President Donald Trump has long called for such an investigation.
He has branded the Russia inquiry a ""witch hunt"" by his opponents.
Critics of Mr Barr, however, have accused him of acting on behalf of the president rather than in the interests of US..."
"Russia's Vladimir Putin will hold a signing ceremony on Friday formally annexing four more areas of Ukraine after self-styled referendums condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.
Russian-backed officials had earlier claimed the five-day exercise secured almost total popular support.
So-called votes were held in Luhansk and Donetsk in the east, and in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south.
The Russian president will make a major speech at the Kremlin.
A stage has already been set up in Moscow's Red Square, with billboards proclaiming the four regions as..."
"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday contradicted President Trump, saying he didn't disagree with the characterization that China is not paying the tariffs on goods coming into the U.S.
Kudlow made the comments after Fox News anchor Chris Wallace repeatedly pressed him on ""Fox News Sunday"" about Trump's recent comments in regard to trade with China. ""It’s not China that pays tariffs. It’s the American importers, the American companies that pay what in effect is a tax increase and oftentimes passes it on to U.S. consumers,"" Wallace..."
"Federal investigators looking into Hunter Biden's business activities are reportedly weighing possible charges, as the probe reaches a ""critical stage.""
Unnamed sources mentioned by CNN told the news channel that prosecutors are considering charges in relation to alleged tax violations and a possibly false statement made during the purchase of a firearm.
Prosecutors also have to consider Justice Department guidelines around the handling of politically sensitive cases close to an election because the midterms are approaching, according to CNN. An unwritten rule says that such cases shouldn't be brought within 60 days of..."
"In his final days in office, then-President Donald Trump pressured top Department of Justice officials to challenge his election loss to Joe Biden, the House Oversight Committee said Tuesday.
The oversight panel said a cache of more than 200 pages of newly released emails from Justice Department officials and White House staff sheds new light on how Trump tried to undermine the results of the 2020 election and advance unsupported voter fraud claims with the “apparent goal” of keeping himself in power."
"As President Trump continues to dispute the result of the US election, false or misleading posts have been spreading on social media about the vote.
Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who have called into question the integrity of the election without providing evidence.
We've checked some of the main claims.

"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is headed on Monday to the crucial electoral state of Pennsylvania, where he plans to mark the U.S. Labor Day holiday by speaking with union workers as the presidential campaign enters its homestretch.
The trip kicks off another flurry of travel to battleground states this week by both Biden and President Donald Trump as some opinion polls show the race tightening with fewer than 60 days until the Nov. 3 election.
With the coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest over racism and police brutality gripping the..."
"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said he would resign from office, bowing to public outcry over scandals that have convulsed the U.S. territory’s political system and further imperiled its economy.
His decision Wednesday marked the first-ever resignation of a Puerto Rico governor and followed the release of nearly 900 pages of vulgar messages between him and his advisers, sparking protests that drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators into the streets of San Juan.
Mr. Rosselló said his resignation would be effective on Aug. 2 at 5:00 p.m. The governorship would..."
"Voting began on Friday in four Ukrainian regions mostly held by Russian forces, the start of a plan by President Vladimir Putin annex a big chunk of Ukraine in what the West says is violation of international law that significantly escalates the war.
After nearly seven months of war that has killed tens of thousands and left some eastern cities of Ukraine wastelands, Putin signalled he will annex the regions if the people in the Russian-controlled areas vote to join Russia.
The voting, which the West and Ukraine says is..."
"he public is going to find out a little more about unidentified flying objects, or as they are called in military circles, “unidentified aerial phenomenon, in about six months. That’s because as part of the U.S. Intelligence budget for 2021, there is now a mandate for the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence to create a standard for collecting and reporting unidentified aerial phenomenon.
They are to submit their report of all that collected information to the senate in 180 days from the date of..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on Thursday that Republicans will oppose a compromise election reform proposal put forward by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).
""I would make this observation about the revised version ... all Republicans I think will oppose that as well if that were to be what surfaced on the floor,"" McConnell told reporters, referring to Manchin's proposal.
McConnell's comments, which came during a press conference with GOP senators railing against the For the People Act, are the latest signal that the election bill will fail during a procedural vote next..."
"U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday voiced qualified support for a bipartisan Senate bill to clarify Congress' role in certifying presidential election results, calling it the only chance to prevent any future chaos like the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol assault.
""I'll proudly support the legislation provided that nothing more than practical changes are made to its current form,"" McConnell said in a floor speech.
""This bill, as introduced, is the only chance to get an outcome and to actually make law,"" he added.
Fourteen lawmakers from both parties..."
"A key outside advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has endorsed the use of COVID-19 booster shots for all adults, a one-size-fits-all approach designed to simplify eligibility.
If CDC Director Rochelle Walensky signs off on the broader use, as expected, the extra shots will be available immediately to all adults, as long as they are six months past the final dose of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, or two months after a Johnson & Johnson dose. 
The recommendation from the panel comes just hours after the Food..."
"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of wanting to ""seize"" Ukraine, amid escalating rhetoric between Russia and the US. The US says Russia has failed to live up to an agreement to end the crisis struck in Geneva last week. American officials say Russia is behind unrest in eastern Ukrainian cities."
"The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and were later allowed to remain in the country for humanitarian reasons are not eligible to become permanent residents.
The court’s unanimous decision could affect thousands of people, including many who have lived in the U.S. for years and hoped to obtain lawful permanent resident status, or a green card.
Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, said the decision was “a straightforward application” of U.S. law, which generally requires an immigrant to have been lawfully admitted to..."
"TEL AVIV—Buoyed by a resounding victory in a party leadership election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brandished his close ties with President Trump to woo right-wing voters as he attempts to break a monthslong political deadlock in the country.
Mr. Netanyahu defeated Likud rival Gideon Saar in Thursday’s primary contest, winning nearly three-quarters of the votes despite corruption charges against him, to lead the party in March’s national election. He failed to form a ruling coalition after inconclusive votes in April and September.
“Now is the time to unite and..."
"Even as Republican governors blast President Biden and congressional Democrats for both causing inflation and failing to address it, they are promoting their own tax cuts that likely will add to consumer demand and raise prices.
Putting more money in people’s pockets will increase demand for goods at a time of supply shortages. That will drive up prices and worsen the inflation that the governors claim to be so worried about. And it will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates even more than it planned.
What a deal:..."
"The Supreme Court on Friday said some lawsuits against Texas' anti-abortion law — the strictest in the country — can proceed.
The big picture: The court's decision is not a ruling on the merits of Texas' law — and leaves the law in place — but it paves the way for the courts to decide whether that law is constitutional.
Driving the news: The decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, says abortion clinics in the state can challenge the Texas law's constitutionality in court. But it allows only a small slice of those lawsuits to..."
"The health department’s politically-appointed communications aides have demanded the right to review and seek changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) weekly scientific reports on the status of the coronavirus pandemic, Politico reported Saturday.
Emails reviewed by Politico and three people reportedly familiar with the situation indicated that communications aides openly complained in emails to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other senior officials that the agency’s reports would undermine President Trump's optimistic messaging about COVID-19.
Politico reported that its three sources said CDC officials have resisted..."

"Virginians headed to the polls Tuesday to elect a new governor in a tight race that is being closely watched as a gauge of the national political mood.
Polls show former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former private-equity executive, are running neck-and-neck to succeed Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Virginia governors are barred from serving consecutive four-year terms.
No Republican has won a statewide race in Virginia since 2009, and the election will test Democrats’ staying power after years of electoral gains. Republicans, meanwhile, hope to reverse losses in the vote-rich suburbs..."
"In striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act this past week, the Supreme Court not only rejected a longstanding rationale for laws disfavoring gays and lesbians—the welfare of children. The court turned it on its head.
Backers had justified the 1996 federal law as a way to ensure children didn't grow up thinking that gay relationships were equal to those of heterosexuals. The same was true for Proposition 8, the 2008 California initiative ending same-sex marriage that also fell with the Wednesday ruling by the high court."
"A top World Health Organization (WHO) official said Monday that it is unlikely that the coronavirus pandemic will end completely in 2021, but noted that deaths and hospitalizations should be drastically reduced by the end of the year due to widespread vaccine access.
The Associated Press reported that Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, told reporters in London it is ""premature"" and ""unrealistic"" to think that COVID-19 would disappear in 2021.

"More than 80 million Americans working in the private sector will be required to receive a COVID vaccine or produce a negative test result at least once a week, a senior Biden administration official said Thursday.
Why it matters: The new rule, to be developed by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), underscores the Biden administration's ramped up efforts to control the virus as cases and hospitalizations largely driven by the Delta variant surge nationwide.
Driving the news: OSHA is developing the rule that will require vaccinations or once..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden will host a White House summit in September to counter the effects of hate-fueled violence on American democracy and highlight his administration’s actions to reduce gun violence, the White House said on Friday.
The Sept. 15 summit, dubbed “United We Stand,” will bring together officials, faith leaders and civil rights groups and feature a keynote speech by Biden, who will put forward a shared vision for a more united America, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

"President Donald Trump gave his Republican National Convention acceptance speech Thursday night. But it wasn’t what he said that had the media world buzzing. It was where he said it.
In what might have been illegal, and what many considered unethical, the president delivered his speech in front of at least 1,500 spectators on the South Lawn of the White House.
“The most notable thing about tonight is the venue,” NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell said. “The fact that he staged this large of a gathering, during a pandemic, without masks,..."
"U.S. sanctions on China over Hong Kong would ratchet up tensions between the two superpowers, but with no obvious goal beyond punishment. President Donald Trump on Friday says he would take steps to slap penalties on officials of the People’s Republic. The first move of its kind would escalate tensions, yet it probably won’t deter Beijing and could spur retaliation.
After months of holding back in response to Hong Kong unrest, the White House has taken aggressive action. A day after the Chinese parliament approved moving forward with legislation tackling..."
"President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. is quitting the World Health Organization and is beginning to revoke Hong Kong’s special status, in an escalation of tension with China.
Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump also said the U.S. would move to sanction Chinese officials over what he called the “smothering” of Hong Kong, but the president steered clear of any discussion of reneging on a trade deal between the two countries, or wider sanctions.
U.S. stocks SPX, 0.48% DJIA, -0.07% COMP, 1.29% reversed early losses to..."
"President Biden will sign an executive order Friday afternoon that takes aim at what the White House describes as the growing problem of corporate consolidation in U.S. and the higher prices, lower wages and reduced choice it imposes on workers and consumers.
The move is the latest salvo in a deepening war between the federal and state governments and big business over monopoly power and anticompetitive practices, and one the Biden administration hopes will boost the economic prospects of Americans without adding to the already substantial federal budget deficit.

"The last US and Nato forces have left Afghanistan's Bagram airbase, the centre of the war against militants for some 20 years.
The pull-out could signal that the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is imminent.
President Joe Biden has said US forces will be gone by 11 September.
But the withdrawal from the sprawling base, north of Kabul, comes as the main jihadist group, the Taliban, advances in many parts of Afghanistan.
The 11 September deadline is the anniversary of the attacks on America in 2001, which killed..."
"California’s reparations task force released its first of two reports detailing the state’s history of slavery and racism and recommending ways the Legislature might begin a process of redress for Black Californians, including proposals to offer housing grants, free tuition and to raise the minimum wage.
The 500-page study describes decades of state and federal government actions that harmed Black Americans — from American slavery to the more recent redlining, mass incarceration, police actions and the widening wealth gap between Blacks and whites.
After police killed George Floyd and the subsequent nationwide..."
"The federal government isn’t moving on raising the minimum wage from $7.25 — but states and cities are.
The big picture: A total of 26 states are set to raise their minimum wage in 2022, according to an analysis by consulting firm Wolters Kluwer.
On top of that, 56 municipalities will bump their pay floors, for a record year of increases, according to the National Employment Law Project.
Why it matters: The battleground has largely moved from the federal level and is playing out in statehouses across the country.
At least 20 states have laws..."
"The world is in ""great peril, and paralyzed"" United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the 77th session of the UN General Assembly kicked off on Tuesday.
After the COVID-19 pandemic restricted in-person attendance the previous two years, more than 150 heads of state and government were expected to attend the annual gathering in New York.
Guterres told them that nations were ""gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction'' and weren't ready or willing to tackle the major challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the fate of the planet.

"Government has announced that the number of people who have lost their lives due to the recent riots, has risen to 117. Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have been the scene of chaos – what started out as semi-violent demonstrations demanding former president Jacob Zuma’s release from prison soon morphed into violent looting sprees targeting malls and other establishments in both provinces.
Acting minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni gave an update on the unrest, on Thursday afternoon, 15 July 2021.

"The leader of the advisory panel charged with evaluating the first Covid-19 vaccination to come before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the shot is very likely to obtain emergency-use authorization.
“I would predict the likelihood of approval is high,” said Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan health researcher who chairs the advisory committee. “We’re not at the borderline on efficacy,” he added, referring to data from the vaccine’s makers— Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech SE—showing the shot is 95% effective at protecting against Covid-19, significantly higher than the..."
A woman alleged in a sworn declaration Wednesday that she witnessed efforts in the early 1980s by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and others to spike drinks and “cause girls to become inebriated” so they could be assaulted. She also alleged that she was a victim of a gang rape at a party at which Mr. Kavanaugh was present.
"A SWAT team barges into a home. Music intensifies as weapons are drawn. A man carrying a gun emerges from the light to look directly into the camera and says, “Join the MAGA crew. Get a RINO hunting permit. There’s no bagging limit, no tagging limit and it doesn’t expire until we save our country.”
It’s a scene from a campaign video for the frontrunner for U.S. Senate in Missouri, Republican candidate Eric Greitens.
The disgraced ex-governor left office in a scandal and now he’s likely to win a Senate..."
"The months-long slide for the S&P 500 index has officially thrown stocks far enough off of their all-time highs to be considered a bear market.
Since the beginning of 2022, the S&P 500 index is down nearly 21% as of Monday afternoon, with companies like Amazon and Google parent Alphabet leading the way with their 39% and 27% respective drops. Elon Musk’s Tesla has also lost 45% of its market value since January — shaving more than $500 billion off of its market cap.
The problem has been exacerbated by inflation and global uncertainty, with experts predicting that a recession could be around..."
"President Biden is canceling projects to build a wall along the southern border using diverted defense funds and will use some funding to counter environmental damage from the wall's construction.
Then-President Trump had diverted billions in defense and military construction funds toward building the wall, using emergency powers after Congress refused to fully fund the project directly.
""Consistent with the President’s Proclamation terminating the redirection of funds for border wall, no more money will be diverted from other purposes to building a border wall,"" a Biden administration official said Friday...."
"Speaking just outside Pittsburgh on the heels of a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, President Joe Biden announced the first of a two-part, multitrillion-dollar push to revitalize America’s infrastructure. One can’t help but wonder if there is any limit to what might be included and how the whole shebang will be funded.
Part one, the “America Jobs Plan,” pegged at $2 trillion, is financed with a “Made in America Tax Plan.” It focuses on what may be called physical capital — roads, bridges, transportation systems, power generation, clean energy, advanced auto..."
"The Department of Homeland Security said it would increase the fee to apply for U.S. citizenship by 81% to $1,160 and impose a fee for the first time to apply for asylum, according to a filing in the Federal Register on Friday.
The fee increases, proposed last year, come as the government agency that handles applications faces a budget shortfall and are the latest in a string of rule changes making it tougher for low-income people to immigrate legally or become U.S. citizens."
"Republicans and Democrats are trying to use the coming fight to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat to motivate their bases, with each side arguing that it would be catastrophic to let the other party pick her replacement.

And they meet, under the banner of another United Nations Conference of Parties, this one COP27, faced with the pressing crises of food and energy shortages and a globe-impacting war in Ukraine.
Efforts at subsequent COP summits remain focused on honoring the pivotal gathering, in 2015 in Paris, when countries voluntarily agreed that warming must be held to 1.5..."

"State candidates, party committees and ballot measure committees for 2021 and 2022 elections are projected to raise more than $7 billion, a new OpenSecrets analysis of state-level campaign finance disclosures projects. 
Although more difficult to predict, expenditures by those same three groups could approach $7 billion, likely surpassing the estimated 2018 midterm spending record of $6.6 billion, adjusted for inflation. 
“As with federal races, money flowing into state elections has skyrocketed in recent years — and 2022 ups the ante again. With so many governors up for election this year,..."

"A miles-long armored Russian military convoy nearing Kyiv and the targeting of civilian areas in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, may herald a new phase of fighting after six days of stiff Ukrainian resistance.
The latest: Russia's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday it will strike facilities in Kyiv belonging to Ukraine's security services and a special operations unit, which Moscow has accused of carrying out cyberattacks. Russia urged Ukrainian citizens living nearby to leave their homes.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released a new video accusing Russia of war crimes for its siege of Kharkiv, a mostly Russian-speaking city near..."
"Former President Trump outlined steps for Republicans to take if they win back control of Congress in November during his speech Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference. 
Trump said the midterms need to be a “national referendum” on President Biden and Democratic control of Congress, and Republicans must ensure Democrats are dealt a “crippling” defeat. His speech at the convention in Dallas, Texas, concluded its third day. 
Trump pointed to candidates he backed in primaries like Tudor Dixon, the Republican nominee for governor of Michigan, and Kari Lake, who won the GOP..."
"Regarding your editorial ""Immigration Breakout"" (Jan. 30): American citizenship is a privilege, not a right, and handing it out en masse to illegal immigrants is simply indefensible. They do have a ""path to citizenship"" today and will continue to do so under a plan that provides legalization without a path to citizenship: the current legal process.
As faulty as the policy logic is, however, the political logic is worse. Leave aside the fact that immigration is unimportant to most voters. With ObamaCare sucking the oxygen out of the political atmosphere..."
"President-elect Joe Biden on Monday named a number of health experts who will serve on his coronavirus task force.
The experts include Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority who said he was forced out his position earlier this year after opposing promoting unproven treatments.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday urged House intelligence panel chairman Adam Schiff to resign, after Attorney General William Barr said Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation did not establish evidence of collusion between the 2016 election campaign and Russia.
“Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!” Trump tweeted.
The tweet came as Trump’s Republican Party intensifies its counter-attack after Barr issued his summary of Mueller’s probe on Sunday. Barr’s letter to Congress did not clear Trump on the..."

"One year after the United States’ chaotic exit from Afghanistan last August, Republican lawmakers are putting renewed pressure on the Biden administration to answer questions about the withdrawal.
In a new report from the House Foreign Affairs Committee minority, Republicans allege that President Joe Biden misled the American public about the consequences of a withdrawal, did not properly prepare for the withdrawal and failed to evacuate many Afghans who worked with the U.S. during the 20-year war there, including elite military personnel.
And if the Biden administration continues to drag..."
"University of Florida students and faculty are protesting the possible naming of Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) as the institution’s next president.
Protesters interrupted a question-and-answer session attended by Sasse on the school’s campus on Monday, where they argued his opposition to same-sex marriage and his positions on LGBTQ issues made him unsuitable to serve as the school’s leader.
The students and faculty protesting Sasse say he has a documented history of embracing anti-LGBTQ messaging and criticizing the legislation and landmark judicial decisions on which modern LGBTQ rights hinge.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday followed through on his threat to veto the annual defense spending bill, which was passed by Congress with broad bipartisan support, as he clashes with lawmakers – and Senate GOP leadership in particular – on a stimulus bill and the election. The National Defense Authorization Act passed both chambers of Congress by wide margins (335-78 in the House, 84-13 in the Senate). In his veto letter, Trump railed against lawmakers’ refusal to accede to his demands to attach a measure to the NDAA repealing Section..."
"The Trump administration is seeking to ban all nontobacco flavors of e-cigarettes in the wake of a massive spike in teen vaping and the spread of a mysterious illness that has sickened hundreds of people across the country.
President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that vaping is a problem “especially vaping as it pertains to innocent children.”
Youth vaping has skyrocketed in the past year, driven largely by teenagers becoming drawn to sweet and fruit-flavored e-cigarette pods easily accessible in stores. The FDA has struggled to keep up..."

"Louisiana lawmakers failed to override Gov. John Bel Edwards’s (D) veto of legislation that would have banned transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams.
Edwards vetoed Senate Bill 156 last month, which would have required athletic teams to allow athletes based on “biological sex.”

"President Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, saying that 90% of Americans in the country who wanted to leave were able to depart.

"A US congressional delegation has arrived for an unannounced visit to Taiwan, 12 days after a tour of the island by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Five members of Congress will visit until Monday, said Washington's de-facto embassy in the capital Taipei.
China launched its largest-ever military exercises around Taiwan after Ms Pelosi's visit earlier in August.

"Tuesday’s primaries, in many ways, upended expectations.
In Kansas, voters rejected a proposed amendment that would have opened the door for state lawmakers to restrict — or even ban — abortions. Meanwhile, in some hotly contested primaries, Republicans appear poised to break with former President Trump and his candidates of choice.
And in Missouri, a late effort to weaken former Gov. Eric Greitens in the GOP Senate primary proved successful. 
Here are five takeaways from the primaries in Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington."

Kenya Minott and Robin Steenman are both concerned about the national uproar around critical race theory, but for different reasons. 
For Dr. Minott, a consultant in Houston who provides anti-racism training, the recent bill passed by Texas lawmakers is a frightening effort to discourage conversations about systemic racism that could lead to better racial justice. It targets what the politicians say are concepts..."
"Acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly’s dismissal of a beloved captain who raised concerns about the health of sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt sparked swift and sudden outrage from lawmakers and former service members who saw the move as retribution.
But within the Navy, the move left sailors, Marines, and former senior leaders more confused than angry. The timeline leading up to the abrupt relief of Capt. Brett Crozier raíses more questions that it answers about why Crozier felt compelled to go outside of his chain of command..."
"U.S. economic growth will recover “rapidly” and the labor market will return to full strength quicker than expected thanks to the vaccine rollout and a barrage of legislation enacted in 2020, according to a government forecast published Monday.

"The Trump campaign is falsely claiming that surveillance camera footage captured election workers in Georgia adding thousands of illegal ballots that were brought into an Atlanta facility in suspicious “suitcases” on election night.
The campaign presented the video to Georgia state lawmakers on Dec. 3. President Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wrote on Twitter the same day: “The video tape doesn’t lie. Fulton County Democrats stole the election. It’s now beyond doubt.” Trump himself later amplified the claim at a rally in Georgia on Dec. 5.
But state officials told..."
"For two decades, Christa Brown has stared down evil, has sacrificed endlessly to stop Southern Baptist predators and expose leaders who helped keep them in pulpits.
“For evil to become systemic, it needs a whole lot of enablers,” she said. “And systemic evil is the most destructive kind, with the most victims, because it is so disguised. It is the evil that smiles at you, and behind the scenes is just devastating people.”"

"The proxy battle between President Trump and establishment Republican figures will come to a head in Tuesday’s Arizona primaries, providing an indication of the direction the GOP might take going forward.
The two wings of the Republican Party have provided contrasting messages in the lead-up to Arizona’s primaries, with Trump and his endorsed candidates zeroing in on his unfounded claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and establishment-backed Republicans focusing on kitchen table issues and being an alternative to Democratic Party control.
This has played out most..."
"The theories of evolution and the Big Bang are real and God is not “a magician with a magic wand”, Pope Francis has declared.

"Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced the creation of a committee to investigate the Capitol Hill riot in January this year.
Mrs Pelosi said the Democratic-led committee would aim to ""establish the truth of that day and ensure that an attack of that kind cannot happen"".

Allies of former President Donald Trump said a commission was not necessary.
His supporters stormed Congress in Washington DC on 6 January in a failed bid..."
"Rep. Madison Cawthorn ( R-N.C.) has been a lightning rod for controversy.
The 26-year-old freshman lawmaker, who was elected to represent North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives to fill the vacant seat left by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in 2020, has been at the center of a series of scandals in the lead-up to his primary on May 17.

"We're all scrambling for ways to help when tragedy strikes. Here’s one big way: Help ease kids through the awfulness.

"Pope Francis visited the site of a former residential school for indigenous Canadian children on Monday morning and repeatedly apologized for Catholics’ role in government-sponsored “projects of cultural destruction and forced assimilation” that he said had devastated their communities.
“I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the indigenous peoples,” the pope said, one of half a dozen ways in which he expressed sorrow or begged for pardon in the speech, which he delivered to an audience of indigenous leaders, elders and former residential school students as well..."
"Ukraine has recaptured over 700 sq kms (270 sq miles) of its territory in the east and the south during a lightning counter offensive, a Ukrainian general said on Thursday, offering the first official assessment of the operation.
The gains, if confirmed and held, are a serious blow for Russia which Western intelligence services say has suffered huge casualties. It also would represent a significant boost for Kyiv, which is keen to show its Western backers that it can change the facts on the ground by force and deserves continued..."
"President Biden on Friday sought to assure the public that his administration would do everything possible to evacuate American citizens and Afghans who assisted U.S. forces in Afghanistan, while acknowledging the mission faced risks and the situation was unpredictable.
In remarks from the East Room of the White House, Biden defended his administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and insisted that officials have made progress in evacuation efforts.
“Make no mistake, this evacuation mission is dangerous. It involves risks to our armed forces and it's being conducted under difficult circumstances,” Biden said. “I..."
"In these days of multitrillion-dollar federal deficits, a windfall of a billion dollars or so for the treasury may sound like a rounding error.
But a billion bucks is a billion bucks. And I’d rather have the treasury make the money for taxpayers’ benefit than for oil companies to end up with it, which is what’s going to happen if something isn’t done.
Now, let me back up a bit and explain what I’m talking about.
It involves making an unconventional use of the federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve to take..."
"R&B singer R. Kelly was found guilty on Wednesday on multiple charges of child pornography and luring underage girls to have sex with him but not guilty of obstructing a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal.
In his latest trial, Kelly - whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly - was found guilty by a jury on six out of 13 counts, prosecutors said.
He was found guilty of three child pornography counts and three counts of enticing minors for sex, but acquitted of seven other charges that..."
"In the longest speech of his presidency, Mr Trump railed against the inquiry into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia.
""We're waiting for a report by people who weren't elected,"" he told a crowd of cheering conservatives.
Mr Mueller is expected to hand in his report to the attorney general shortly. ""Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there and all of a sudden they are trying to take you out with..."
"Boris Johnson has defied the normal rules of politics for so long, it is hard to believe he is actually going.
Scandals that would have sunk other politicians appeared to have no effect on him. He was always able to bounce back. His gaffes and blunders became part of his brand.
In an age of boring, machine-like politicians, he was seen as a ""character"", his unruly mop of blond hair and bumbling persona instantly recognisable even to those with no interest in politics. His fun-loving, relentlessly upbeat image, allied to..."
"It’s political endorsement season.
Editorial boards from newspapers across the country are coming out with endorsements for political offices, from the local level all the way to the president of the United States.
But in these divisive and polarizing times, might they do more damage than good if an endorsement can potentially alienate half of a publication’s audience?
Are they still worth doing?
Last month, The New York Times’ Ben Smith wrote that the 30 papers in the McClatchy chain would only make a presidential endorsement if they actually conducted..."
"“He’s unpresidential.”
“He’s crude and unkind.”
“He’s just not a good man.”
These things, and much worse, are commonly said of President Donald Trump. His personality totally eclipses his record.
So we, seemingly, have him on the dunk tank, ready for a very cold bath.
Let’s play dump the lout.
But is this really what it’s about?
Isn’t the real question whether he has been taking the country, and the economy of this region, in the right direction these last four years?
Can we separate the man from the record?..."
"Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, working to shore up his bond with the conservative wing of his party, declared at a Christian university Saturday that “there is no more powerful or liberating influence on this earth than the Christian conscience in action.”
The former Florida governor was the commencement speaker at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., the school founded by well-known evangelist Jerry Falwell that has become a frequent stop for preside"
"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and his Democratic rival Stacey Abrams faced off on Monday in their first debate since they competed for the governor’s mansion in 2018. 
The debate quickly became a policy-heavy affair, with the candidates hammering each other over everything from education to crime to election laws. What’s more, it unfolded on the first day of the state’s early voting period, offering Abrams and Kemp a key chance to make their cases to undecided voters before they cast their ballots.
Here are five takeaways from the Georgia gubernatorial debate.
Unlike in..."
"President Donald Trump's difficult week with the military got a little worse on Monday, when the commander in chief accused the Pentagon leadership of pushing for conflicts in order to keep defense contractors profitable.
The president later shared tweets comparing himself to former President Dwight Eisenhower, who warned Americans about the rising power of the military-industrial complex in a 1961 speech marking the end of his time in office."
"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday took the dramatic step of overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized it nationwide, handing a momentous victory to Republicans and religious conservatives who want to limit or ban the procedure.
The court, in a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, upheld a Republican-backed Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The vote was 5-4 to overturn Roe, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing separately to say he would have..."
"As if impeachment wasn’t providing enough news, New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drewdecided to switch parties. Even though it’s not quite official, more than half of his staff resigning should be a significant clue.
His decision changes the partisan makeup in the House by one seat without fundamentally altering the 2020 fight for the majority.
Van Drew was facing pressure from the left for not being progressive enough and pressure from the right because he represents a district Donald Trump carried in 2016, with votes on two articles of impeachment..."
"A suspected Russian hack that is rippling across federal agencies and U.S. businesses highlights the far-reaching impacts of attacks on supply chains.
Customers of the software provider SolarWinds Inc. began unknowingly installing malware this spring through seemingly routine updates to a network-management tool, the company reported in a regulatory filing Monday. The updates included a weak point created by attackers and could have exposed nearly 18,000 of the Austin, Texas, company’s 300,000 customers.
While the fallout remains unclear, the monthslong campaign by the hackers underscores the complexities of vetting and..."
"President Trump dropped his threat of tariffs on billions of dollars of Mexican imports after negotiators reached a deal on measures to stem the flow of migrants pouring into the U.S. from Mexico, averting a potentially devastating trade fight for both countries.
Mr. Trump said the tariffs, which had been set to go into effect Monday, were “indefinitely suspended,” while Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that, thanks to the support of all Mexicans, “the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the U.S. have been avoided.”..."
"The serial entrepreneur's new project will let the public rate ""the core truth"" of news articles. Elon Musk is apparently tired of ""fake news"" or perhaps bad press, so he's creating a new site called Pravda to let the public rate ""the core truth"" of articles and track credibility scores of journalists, editors and publications.
The interestingly named Pravda, which was also the name of a Russian communist propaganda broadsheet, means ""truth"" in Russian, and it will be somewhat akin to a Yelp for journalism. Musk, the founder of SpaceX..."
"IN MID-MARCH, AS San Francisco mayor London Breed issued a citywide stay-at-home order, Peggy Cmiel started getting prepared. Cmiel is the director of clinical operations at the San Francisco Center for Jewish Living, or SFCJL, a 9-acre senior housing complex in the Excelsior neighborhood that includes long-term care facilities, short-term rehab housing, and a memory care wing. The campus houses over 300 elderly residents, members of one of the populations most vulnerable to the deadly and highly infectious coronavirus that has spread across the globe."
"Two Americans detained in Ukraine while fighting on the Ukrainian side of the war were mercenaries who endangered the lives of Russian servicemen and should face responsibility for their actions, the Kremlin said on Monday.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, interviewed by the U.S. television network NBC news, also said U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner, held in Russia for more than two months, was guilty of drug offences and not a hostage.
Peskov's comments were the first formal acknowledgment that the two men, identified in U.S. reports as Andy Huynh, 27,..."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is facing mounting scrutiny over his handling of COVID-19 nursing home deaths after revelations that a top aide said officials ""froze"" providing information about the deaths after questions from the Department of Justice (DOJ) last year.
The remarks have set off a renewed firestorm over Cuomo's handling of the deaths and whether his administration sought to cover up details. They also undermine the star profile the governor developed on the national level at the start of the pandemic as he gave signature daily press..."
"Dr. Scott Atlas has resigned as special adviser to President Donald Trump, a White House official said on Monday, after a controversial four months during which he clashed repeatedly with other members of the coronavirus task force. Voters’ unhappiness with Trump’s response to the global pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands helped propel his challenger, Democrat Joe Biden, to victory in the Nov. 3 election.
“I am writing to resign from my position as special adviser to the president of the United States,” Atlas said in a letter to..."
"President Joe Biden said a 9mm bullet ""blows the lung out of the body"" while discussing options on gun legislation on Monday, prompting some to suggest he was calling for handguns to be banned.
Biden made the remarks while speaking to reporters outside the White House, a day after he and first lady Jill Biden visited Uvalde, Texas, and comforted families grieving the 19 children and two teachers who were killed in a mass shooting at an elementary school last week.
The president has urged Congress to pass broader gun measures, such as new ban..."
"President Trump on Friday will become the first president to attend in-person the March for Life.
Trump quote-tweeted a video of last year's pro-life event, adding ""See you on Friday...Big Crowd!""
The president addressed the gathering in 2018 via video stream, and Vice President Pence attended in 2019."
"President Trump revealed this week he would become the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, as a new poll registered record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws.
The March for Life says its mission is to “promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion.” Trump previously spoke at the rally remotely, while Vice President Mike Pence in 2017 became the first U.S. vice president to attend.
“See you on Friday...Big Crowd!” Trump said on Twitter TWTR, -0.68% Wednesday,..."
"Russia claims that biological weapons are being developed in laboratories in Ukraine with support from the United States.
It says evidence is now being destroyed to conceal the country's weapons programme, but the US says this is ""total nonsense"" and that Russia is inventing false narratives to justify its actions in Ukraine.
We've looked into some of the claims and assess whether there's any evidence to support them.
Russia has accused the US and Ukraine of working with ""pathogens of dangerous infections"" in 30 laboratories across the country. Pathogens are..."
"Michael Forest Reinoehl, a self-described anti-fascist who said he provided security for Portland racial justice protests, appears to have targeted a participant in a pro-Trump rally, emerging from an alcove of a parking garage before firing two gunshots, one that hit the man’s bear spray can and the other that proved fatal, according to a police affidavit unsealed Friday.
Police found a single Winchester .380-caliber bullet casing on the street, a metal canister of “Bear Attack Detector” that had a “large defect” in it and a collapsible metal baton just..."
"President Trump on Tuesday evening accused Twitter of “stifling FREE SPEECH” and interfering in the 2020 election by fact-checking one of his tweets on the issue of voting by mail.
“@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,” the president tweeted Tuesday evening. “Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!”..."
"The House of Representatives is due to vote Thursday on two immigration bills that would provide a path to citizenship for millions living illegally in the United States, just as the country faces the biggest surge of migrants at its southwestern border in 20 years.
The bills to help farmworkers and younger immigrants known as “Dreamers” are an effort to take targeted steps forward while congressional Democrats deliberate President Joe Biden’s comprehensive immigration plan.
But it will be an uphill battle for either a limited or extensive immigration program to..."
"Amid the worst day for U.S. stocks since the 2008 financial crisis, the five most valuable tech companies lost $321.6 billion in value, with Apple accounting for almost one-third of that sum.
Shares of the iPhone maker plunged 7.9%. Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet each lost more than 6% and Amazon fell 5.3%. They had been among the biggest contributors to the market’s extended rally that lifted the S&P 500 to a record just last month, and now their declines are having an outsized impact on the broader index...."
"Marco Rubio finishes third, separating himself from the field. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz outmuscled businessman Donald Trump to win the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses on Monday, cementing his status as the leading alternative to the Republican front-runner. The results Monday set the stage for a series of high-stakes showdowns in the weeks ahead between Messrs. Cruz and Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose late surge was enough to break into the top tier."
"The Group of 7 wealthy nations on Friday pledged to deliver more than 1 billion doses of the coronavirus vaccine to lower-income countries beginning this summer.
Why it matters: The G7 countries have been criticized for not sharing vaccines with nations that have fewer resources and are struggling to contain new waves of the pandemic.
The big picture: The G7 committed to delivering COVID-19 vaccines to other countries over the next 12 months, per a White House statement."
"A group of protesters gathered outside one of Netflix Inc.’s NFLX 1.78% Los Angeles offices Wednesday to express anger over the streaming giant’s Dave Chappelle comedy special, as some employees released demands for management and staged a walkout.
In the special, “The Closer,” Mr. Chappelle made jokes and remarks regarding gender that many in the transgender community, including some Netflix staffers, found offensive. The company has defended the special, citing reasons including the company’s commitment to artistic freedom.
Carrying signs that read “Transphobia Isn’t Funny” and “Trans Lives Matter,” protesters demanded that Netflix offer more inclusive..."
"The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unprecedented sanctions imposed in response by the U.S. and western allies have rattled the global economy and financial markets. 
They’ve also upended supply chains for crucial food, energy and industrial products amid a global burst of inflation, derailed global travel and driven volatility into the stock market.
Here are five ways the Russian invasion of Ukraine impacts Americans. 
Energy and oil prices rise
Oil prices skyrocketed Monday as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its fifth day and the U.S. and European Union continued..."
"For many, the question is, why should the United States worry at all about Ukraine? 
Some on the ideological right argue that Ukraine isn’t really a democracy, and therefore not worth the trouble. They accuse Democrats of using this crisis as a political distraction with an eye toward midterm elections. 
These are cynical arguments that ignore some harsh realities. They are also dangerous, given how Putin could be emboldened even further if he felt the United States was politically divided over how to respond to his aggressions. 
Level-headed Republicans, such as..."
"No sooner did news leak that U.S. President Joe Biden planned to withdraw the remaining 3,500 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan by Sept. 11 than the Washington Post’s editorial board swung into action, penning an April 13 opinion piece condemning the president’s decision. Biden, it huffed, was taking “the easy way out.”
The Washington Post’s reaction matters only insofar as it signals the tide of criticism Biden will face. Those objections amount to a cobbling together of familiar Washington bromides, nourished by the abiding conviction that the United States’ 20-year campaign..."
"Congress delivered a stinging rebuke to President Trump during a rare New Year's Day session Friday, handing him his first veto override in the final days of his administration.
The GOP-controlled Senate voted 81-13 to override Trump’s veto of a mammoth defense bill, well above the two-thirds support necessary, underscoring the depth of disagreement between the two sides of Pennsylvania Avenue.
The House voted 322-87 earlier this week to nix Trump’s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which greenlights spending levels and lays out policy for the Pentagon."
"President Biden and his top advisers are caught in a loop: They know inflation wounds them politically and hurts their voters, but scrapping some inflationary policies would wound them politically — and hurt their voters.
Why it matters: The president remains committed to the core elements of his economic program, even as price hikes threaten to wipe out Democrats in November's midterms.
His approach includes imposing strict ""Buy American"" requirements on all federal spending, and, so far, maintaining President Trump's tariffs on China.
Both of those hardline policies put upward pressure..."
"The loss of power at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine does not have any critical impact on safety, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in a statement on Wednesday.
""Heat load of spent fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sufficient for effective heat removal without need for electrical supply,"" the IAEA said in a statement."
"Thomas Barrack, a private equity investor who is a close friend of former President Donald Trump, was arrested Tuesday morning in Los Angeles on federal charges of illegally lobbying Trump on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.
Barrack, who was charged with two other men in a seven-count indictment in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, was chairman of Trump’s 2017 inaugural fund.
The Santa Monica, California, resident is accused with the other defendants of secretly advancing the interests of the UAE at the direction of senior officials of that country by..."
"Senate and House leaders are closing in on a coronavirus relief deal that would include direct stimulus payments, according to sources familiar with the talks.
The package is based largely on a $748 billion relief bill that a bipartisan group of Senate and House moderates unveiled Monday plus a new round of stimulus checks, although at an amount lower than the payments of up to $1,200 per adult included in the CARES Act passed by Congress in March.
It will leave out $160 billion in funding for state and local..."

“We also seek to understand the..."
"Newly reported Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. rose from a day earlier, while hospitalizations decreased slightly.
The nation reported 174,589 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, up from 141,999 cases Monday but down from 225,423 a week earlier.
At least six states including Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington didn’t update their Covid-19 data dashboards for Monday, Johns Hopkins said. This could lead to a data backlog that skews numbers in the following days."
"President Biden acknowledged reports on Tuesday that Russia has ordered the partial withdrawal of its troops near Ukraine's borders, but stressed that the U.S. has ""not yet verified"" the Kremlin's claims and that an invasion remains ""distinctly possible.""
Why it matters: Biden's update from the White House came at a critical moment in the crisis over Russia's massive military buildup, with U.S. officials warning that an invasion of Ukraine could take place as soon ""at any moment.""
Biden said Moscow's claims of a military pullback, which President Vladimir Putin acknowledged himself on Tuesday,..."
"The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated last year, has raised its official Covid-19 death toll by 50%, adding 1,290 fatalities.
Wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals. China has insisted there was no cover-up.
It has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak.
Wuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased.
The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing..."
"WASHINGTON—House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Richard Neal set a final April 23 deadline for the IRS to turn over President Trump’s tax returns.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the new deadline “arbitrary” on Saturday without saying whether the administration would meet it as it studies the legal questions involved. If that date passes without the documents or a resolution to the dispute, House Democrats and the Trump administration could be headed for a clash in federal court."
"The US is cutting off another financial route for Russia to pay its international debts, a move that could push the country closer to default.
The US Treasury Department said it would end a waiver that had allowed US bondholders to accept payments, tightening sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine.
Russia, which is rich from its oil and gas supplies, has the funds to pay.
It has already signalled plans to contest any declaration of default.
The country has almost $2 billion worth of payments that will be due..."

"Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, plans to acquire Parler, a Twitter-like social media app that has become a haven for conservatives.

But House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and other top Democrats have called for the release of the full report, without redactions, to lawmakers. They have given Barr until Tuesday..."
"As the United States continues to pursue diplomacy amid a Russian military buildup near Ukraine’s borders, recent developments have put NATO’s ability to present a united front in question.
On Friday, it emerged that Germany was blocking NATO ally Estonia from transferring German-origin howitzer artillery to Ukraine, while off-the-cuff remarks from Germany’s navy chief Kay-Achim Schönbach—saying that Crimea would not return to Ukraine and that Russian President Vladimir Putin deserved respect—forced his resignation over the weekend.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made no secret of the country’s hesitancy to provide arms that may..."
"A Texas sheriff has launched a criminal investigation into the flights arranged by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis which brought 48 Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha's Vineyard last week.

"A fast-moving fire near Yosemite National Park exploded in size on Saturday, prompted a state of emergency to be declared for California's Mariposa County.
The blaze—called the Oak Fire—broke out on Friday afternoon near the town of Midpines and has since grown into one of California's largest wildfires of the year.
It covered more than 14,281 acres and was zero percent contained as of Sunday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for Mariposa County on..."
"Democratic presidential contenders battled over healthcare coverage and border policy on Wednesday during a surprisingly heated first debate that laid bare the party’s divisions on whether to abolish private insurance and shift to a Medicare-for-All system.
In the first round of back-to-back debates, several of the lesser-known candidates vied for attention in the crowded race to take on President Donald Trump, shouting over one another to grab the spotlight and prove they are capable of standing up to the Republican in the November 2020 election.
The Democratic contenders repeatedly attacked..."
"The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday said former President Donald Trump may have engaged in criminal conduct in his bid to overturn his election defeat.

He said, however, that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)..."

"U.S. border agents detained nearly 100,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, according to two people familiar with preliminary figures, the highest arrest total for the month of February since 2006.
The figures, which have not been previously reported, show the scope of a growing surge of migrants arriving at the southwest border as U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, seeks to roll back some of the restrictive policies of former President Donald Trump, a Republican.
In particular, an increasing number of children arriving at the border without a..."
"Democrats on Tuesday blasted the top Senate Republican’s proposed rules for U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, saying its failure to guarantee witnesses or that evidence gathered by investigators would be allowed into the record was tantamount to rigging the proceedings.
Trump’s trial on charges approved on Dec. 18 by the Democratic-led House of Representatives accusing him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress begins in earnest in the Senate on Tuesday in a rare use of the constitutional mechanism for ousting a president.
On Monday, Senate Republican Majority..."
"President Joe Biden plans to withdraw the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, 20 years to the day after the al Qaeda attacks that triggered America’s longest war, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. The disclosure of the plan came on the same day that the U.S. intelligence community released a gloomy outlook for Afghanistan, forecasting “low” chances of a peace deal this year and warning that its government would struggle to hold the Taliban insurgency at bay if the U.S.-led coalition withdraws support.
Biden’s decision would..."
"Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) is teeing up a Saturday vote to wind down debate on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill, with senators hoping to pass the legislation as soon as this weekend.

"The emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, with a suite of mutations that suggests it might be extra transmissible and be able to evade at least some immune protection, has the world eager for answers about what it means for the Covid-19 pandemic. But so much remains unknown largely because the variant appears to have been detected and publicized so quickly.
With other variants, a matter of months passed between the time they were first documented until they were designated “variants of concern” — in some cases giving scientists..."
"  Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig, a conservative who served as an informal advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence, testified before the Jan. 6 select committee on Thursday that Pence would have led a “revolution within a constitutional crisis” if he followed then-President Trump’s order to reject the results of the 2020 presidential election.

"On Friday, President Trump unrolled what he refers to as a “platinum plan” for Black America, calling for increased investment in Black businesses and additional capital for Black entrepreneurs. The President also announced support for Juneteenth to be recognized as a national holiday.

"While many Americans have used their stimulus checks to cover basic needs such as groceries, mortgage or rent, there’s evidence people are also spending the money on non-essentials including electronics, clothes and toys, according to major retailers.
“Call it relief spending, as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars, leading to sales increases in categories such as apparel, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys,” Walmart WMT, -0.36% CEO Doug McMillon said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday.

Lenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in “financial hardship” programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.
Nearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.
The numbers have surged from a year..."
"US President Donald Trump has left hospital, three days after being admitted with Covid-19, vowing to be back on the campaign trail soon.
He flew for the short trip back to the White House on the presidential helicopter Marine One.
""Feeling really good!"" Mr Trump tweeted earlier. ""Don't be afraid of Covid. Don't let it dominate your life.""
More than 7.4 million cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the US. The virus has killed nearly 210,000 Americans.
Questions remain over the seriousness of Mr Trump's illness after a weekend..."
"President Trump gave his first public remarks since contracting Covid-19 more than a week earlier, speaking to hundreds of pro-police activists Saturday on the White House lawn.
The president—who didn’t wear a mask—emerged from the White House on Saturday pumping his fists, to cheers of “USA” from the audience. “I’m feeling great,” he said. In taped videos and brief appearances earlier in the week, the president had at times appeared short of breath, but sounded better in his nearly 20-minute speech Saturday.
In a memo Saturday evening, Dr. Sean Conley,..."
"President Donald Trump says he feels “terribly” for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he faces a decades-old accusation of sexual assault. Trump says the judge “is not a man that deserves this.”
Trump spoke Tuesday at a joint press conference with the president of Poland. He praised Kavanaugh, saying he was “at a level that we rarely see,” but said he supported a review process in the Senate."
"President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive student loan debt for many borrowers will cost roughly $400 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate released on Monday, rekindling a debate over the cost of student debt forgiveness and whether the plan will accelerate inflation.
The CBO estimates Biden's student loan debt forgiveness program will cost $400 billion.
The CBO also estimated Biden’s decision to pause student loan payments through the end of the year—extending a pause that began in 2020—will cost another $20 billion.
The estimates come one month after Biden offered..."
"President Trump's convention speech last night did not frame the coronavirus as a thing that's over, the way some of the other programming during the convention had.
What happened: He acknowledged the 180,000 Americans who have died, and the toll on their families, and used the present and future tenses to describe a response that is still ongoing, but he painted a rosier picture of the U.S. response, and made bolder predictions, than the facts fully support.
Trump promised that the U.S. ""will produce a vaccine by the end of..."
"In a dramatic ending on Thursday to the final scheduled public hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, the committee unanimously voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump. “We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion, and every American is entitled to those answers,” said committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney ahead of the vote.
The subpoena means that Trump has been ordered by the committee to provide relevant documents and testimony under oath as part of its investigation...."
"Attorney General Merrick Garland addressed ""a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence"" against schools and employees on subjects such as mask mandates on Tuesday and plans to implement actions and investigations in the next 30 days, the Associated Press reported.
""While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views,"" Garland said.
Garland said the FBI would begin working with federal, state, local, territorial and tribal authorities and hold strategy sessions to..."
"Employers tapped the brakes on hiring in May, signaling companies are taking a more cautious approach at a time of slowing global growth and trade tensions and adding to other signs of slowing U.S. economic growth this spring.
The economy added 75,000 jobs in May, marking the 104th straight month of gains, but pulling back from two months of stronger hiring, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate held steady at 3.6%, a near-50-year low.
Wages were up 3.1% on the year in May. Annual pay gains appear to..."
"Due to the weekend and federal holidays, the closing of government agencies and services won’t be fully felt until Wednesday. The partial government shutdown that began Saturday triggered furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, but was otherwise expected to have minimal initial impact as states plugged some funding gaps. The Trump administration is hopeful that the partial shutdown will be over by the time many of the affected employees return to work after Christmas, though it is preparing for it to last longer, a senior administration official said..."
"Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday fired his deputy chief of staff at the center of the politically charged George Washington Bridge lane closures—as federal prosecutors opened an investigation into the matter.
The U.S. Justice Department said Thursday they will scrutinize whether the lane closures, which caused crippling traffic in Fort Lee, N.J., violated federal law.
Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said: ""The Port Authority Office of Inspector General has referred the matter to us, and our office is reviewing the matter to determine whether..."
"NASA's DART spacecraft successfully slammed into a distant asteroid at hypersonic speed on Monday in the world's first test of a planetary defense system, designed to prevent a potential doomsday meteorite collision with Earth.
Humanity's first attempt to alter the motion of an asteroid or any celestial body played out in a NASA webcast from the mission operations center outside Washington, D.C., 10 months after DART was launched.
The livestream showed images taken by DART's camera as the cube-shaped ""impactor"" vehicle, no bigger than a vending machine with two rectangular..."
"Philonise Floyd said Wednesday that he's seeking only one thing from Congress in the wake of his brother's killing two weeks ago: ""Justice for George.""
Floyd spoke the words Wednesday morning in the Capitol as he headed into a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee to examine police brutality and Congress's role in preventing it.
Once the hearing began, he offered an emotional opening statement as he described watching the video of his brother's death. A Minneapolis police officer, who has since been fired and charged with second-degree murder, pinned..."
"The Supreme Court ruled the Biden administration can terminate the Trump administration’s “Migrant Protection Protocols,” also known as the “Remain in Mexico” program, which required asylum seekers at the U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. 
The justices, in a 5-4 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, overturned a federal appeals court decision requiring the Biden administration to restart the policy after the Republican-led states sued to maintain the program. 
Former President Donald Trump instituted the policy in 2019 to deter migrants from applying for..."
"A federal judge ordered that President Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen must be released from prison and sent back to home confinement, saying he believes the government sent him back to prison as retaliation for refusing to agree to not writing a book about Trump and, in doing so, violated his First Amendment rights."
"The US has recorded at least 94,000 new Covid-19 cases over the last 24 hours, with spikes in dozens of states days before the presidential election.
It is the second day in a row the country has broken its daily new case record after reporting more than 91,000 infections on Thursday.
More than nine million total cases have been reported in the US, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.
The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday.
Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with..."
"The Biden administration declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency on Thursday, a move that comes amid growing case counts and a groundswell of criticism over the way the administration has handled the outbreak.
The move comes as news stories chronicle a series of missteps in the administration’s response to the outbreak, from its failure to rapidly divert vaccine stockpiled as a hedge against bioterrorism to combat spread of monkeypox to its slow decision-making, which led to missed opportunities to vaccinate more quickly."
"As the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic approached 80,000, governors from New York to Ohio to California took steps toward reopening businesses as the economic wreckage from lockdowns climbed.
Deaths in the U.S. reached 79,894, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. World-wide, more than 284,000 people have perished from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The numbers may undercount the true death toll, researchers say.
Senior White House officials urged governors to move toward restarting commerce as signs of the economic harm rose. The U.S. unemployment..."
"All governorates in Iraq were placed under curfew starting at 7 p.m. on Monday evening amid violent clashes in Baghdad's Green Zones that broke out after followers of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Muqatada al-Sadr stormed the president palace earlier in the day. The curfew will continue until further notice.
The latest demonstrations come after Sadr announced his ""final retirement"" from politics and the closure of all organizations affiliated with him. Iraq has been swept by political turmoil in the past year, as Sadr and his rivals have both attempted to form a government..."
"President Biden will nominate Ketanji Brown Jackson, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C., to the Supreme Court, setting up the likely seating of the nation’s first Black woman justice, according to multiple reports.
For Jackson, her nomination culminates a meteoric rise through the federal judiciary following just eight months on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a role she was chosen for after eight years as a federal district court judge in D.C.
Biden’s decision caps off a month of closely held deliberations at the White House over..."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently authorized two antiviral pills, one from Pfizer and one from Merck, making them the first at-home treatment for COVID-19 that has been touted as a game changer in the fight against the pandemic.
However, experts told NBC News that the pills will require careful monitoring by doctors and pharmacists. 
While Pfizer's Paxlovid has been authorized for use in children 12 and over with underlying health conditions including heart disease or diabetes, a component of the antiviral cocktail could have serious and life- threatening interactions with drugs including blood thinners, statins..."
"Worker filings for jobless claims rose to 744,000 last week, pausing a downward trend amid other signs of recent labor-market improvement.
Initial claims unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 16,000 last week from an upwardly revised 728,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average, which smooths out volatility in the figures, rose slightly to 723,750 from 721,250.
Despite the increase, claims remain close to the lowest point since mid-March of last year, when the pandemic triggered millions of layoffs. Claims are..."
"A new video investigation released Monday by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas Action shows how Democratic-aligned organizations used a tactic called 'bird-dogging' to incite violence and chaos at Trump rallies for media consumption. A key Clinton operative is captured on camera saying, ""It doesn’t matter what the friggin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfucker."""
"A federal judge in Louisiana has blocked the Biden administration from ending Title 42, a controversial pandemic-era border policy that prevents migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border from asking for asylum.
U.S. District Judge Robert R. Summerhays of the Western District of Louisiana issued an injunction on Friday against the Biden administration, after signaling at a hearing last week that he was inclined to take the step. Judge Summerhays, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, had previously issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the federal government from preparing to phase..."
"The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) is calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to report racial data in updates on the coronavirus outbreak after figures reported by certain states and counties showed black Americans are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.
The group sent a letter to the CDC on Tuesday requesting the data after sending a separate letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last week. A CDC official told The Hill that the agency will provide some figures regarding race as soon as..."
"Last month, the Biden administration announced a plan to begin administering third shots of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to healthy people in mid-September to shore up potentially flagging immunity to the coronavirus. 
But many scientists say that given the available evidence, which shows the two-dose vaccines still provide formidable protection against severe disease, it’s not yet clear that boosters are needed.
“What we expected from this vaccine is that we wanted it to protect against severe disease and the kind of disease that caused you to go to the..."
"The impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump will reach a critical juncture on Wednesday when lawmakers launch their first televised public hearings, marking a new phase that could determine the fate of his tumultuous presidency.
Democrats leading the U.S. House of Representatives probe have summoned three U.S. diplomats - all of whom have previously expressed alarm in closed-door testimony about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine - to detail their concerns under the glare of wall-to-wall news coverage this week. The public hearings are scheduled for Wednesday and Friday.
With a..."
"Remote learning has moved to the top of the school agenda with a vengeance since March of last year. Without it, tens of millions of American students would have been without formal instruction during the pandemic. It’s a big topic moving forward as we think about what schools will look like come September.
A few policymakers are big fans. Take, for example, Eric Adams, one of the front-runners in the race to become New York City’s newest mayor. This February, the former policeman opined at a meeting of the Citizens..."
"Multiple schools across the Uvalde School District opened this week, months after the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting that left 19 students and two teachers dead last spring.
The big picture: Robb Elementary, the scene of the horrific Uvalde school shooting, remains permanently closed.
""We're not going back to that campus,"" Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Superintendent Hal Harrell said last spring, per Axios.
""We have plans for it to become something other than a school site,” Harrell said."
"The US is to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to developing nations from next year.
President Joe Biden made the pledge at a virtual Covid-19 summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, promising an ""arsenal of vaccines"".
The additional jabs will see the total US commitment on vaccine sharing exceed one billion jabs.
Experts say some 11 billion doses are required to vaccinate at least 70% of the global population.
The World Health Organisation has set a minimum target of 40% vaccine coverage in..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) are set to meet on Tuesday afternoon with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.
The meeting, which two sources confirmed to The Hill, will be the first time administration officials and Democratic leadership have sat down for face-to-face discussions about a fifth coronavirus relief package.
It comes as Congress and the White House are under intense pressure to provide more relief with coronavirus cases climbing across the country and unemployment stuck in..."
"Timothy Thibault, an FBI agent accused of political bias over his role in the Hunter Biden laptop investigation, retired from his job on Friday.
The former Assistant Special Agent in Charge was escorted out of his Washington D.C. office, as is standard practice, according to Fox News.
Thibault rose to public attention as one of 13 assistant special agents who was investigating Biden's laptop, which the FBI seized in 2019, ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Earlier in August he was removed from this supervisory role by FBI director Christopher Wray, following whistleblower accusations of..."
"The Republican leaders of the U.S. Senate will introduce a proposal for additional coronavirus relief on Tuesday and could schedule a vote as soon as this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.
He said the proposal - expected to have a far smaller scope than a bill passed in the Democratic-led House of Representatives - would focus on “some of the very most urgent healthcare, education and economic issues.”
“It does not contain every idea our party likes. I am confident Democrats will feel the same. Yet Republicans believe..."
"Democrats face a test of unity in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs.
While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on childcare and education. Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is determined to launch..."
"The FBI on Sunday identified the hostage-taker in the standoff at a Colleyville synagogue as Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British citizen.
Akram — who could be heard speaking during a livestream that broadcast a portion of the 11-hour standoff — died Saturday night after a hostage rescue team breached the building. The four hostages were unharmed.
Authorities said Saturday that Akram was killed in a shooting but did not answer a question about whether he was shot by law enforcement or if the gunshot was self-inflicted. The man claimed..."
"August has been a big month for the environment. At the national level, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates over $360 billion to help fight climate change. And more locally, Gov. Charlie Baker signed a sweeping state climate and clean energy bill into law.
Both laws cover a lot of ground. But one notable commonality is the emphasis on getting more electric vehicles on the road. To help make this happen, the laws establish tax credits or rebates for consumers — you don’t have to choose one, you can..."
"President Joe Biden will be briefed by advisers this week on infrastructure, climate and jobs proposals being considered by the White House that could collectively cost as much as $4 trillion, according to people familiar with discussions. Biden advisers are weighing a price tag of between $3 trillion and $4 trillion for new legislative action, including repairing the country’s crumbling infrastructure and tackling climate change, one source said.
A second source said Biden advisers have a package of proposals totaling up to $3 trillion for infrastructure and other priorities they..."
"Millions more Americans who work in excess of 40 hours a week will qualify for overtime pay under a proposed rule the Labor Department is expected to unveil this week—a signature White House initiative aimed at strengthening the middle class and tackling income inequality.
The agency is proposing to raise to $970 a week the salary threshold that generally determines who is eligible for overtime pay, according to sources familiar with the administration’s plans."
"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) met on Wednesday with President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Manchin, in a statement, said he and Jackson talked about ""her experience, record and opinions on important issues impacting West Virginians"" but that he would wait until after her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which is scheduled to start on March 21, to decide how he will vote.
""We had a positive and productive meeting. I appreciate her willingness to meet with me ahead of her confirmation vote. Just as I have with previous nominees, I will closely..."
"Anthony Q. Warner, 63, has been identified as the ""bomber"" in the Christmas day explosion in Nashville by U.S. Attorney Don Cochran.
Cochran announced the update to the investigation in a Sunday afternoon news conference.
""Anthony Warner is the bomber. He was present when the bomb went off, and he perished in the bombing,"" Cochran said.
DNA found at the scene was matched to samples taken at another location searched by investigators, TBI Director David Rausch said Sunday. The TBI was involved in testing the evidence."
"Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski said she was “disturbed” by the Senate leader’s approach to working with White House counsel on the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, saying there should be distance between the two.
The comments by the Alaska lawmaker come after Mitch McConnell, majority leader of the Republican-led Senate, said during a Fox News interview earlier this month that he was working in “total coordination” with the White House on the upcoming trial.
“To me it means that we have to take that step back from being..."
"Both parties say it’s urgent for the federal government to continue propping up businesses and average Americans with a new relief bill. But rifts over the size of the package – and which elements are most critical – remain.
As the economy approaches a daunting cliff of expiring coronavirus relief programs, House Democrats have already responded by passing an economic rescue bill that’s even bigger than the first.
Republicans are exhibiting a very different mindset – espousing the view that, despite the urgency of the moment, it’s better not..."
"Taliban militants in Afghanistan on Saturday handed over Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held as a prisoner of war for almost five years, to U.S. Special Operations Forces in exchange for the release of five Afghan Taliban prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay prison.
The breakthrough was brokered by Qatar, which sent representatives to the U.S. military prison in Cuba to take custody of the five detainees, who used to be high-ranking members of the former Taliban government. The five were being flown to the small Gulf state where..."
"Millions of Americans will head to the polls in the coming days and cast votes on whether or not to legalize the use of marijuana in their states. If past is precedent, most — if not all — of these statewide ballot measures will be enacted into law.
Beginning with California in 1996, voters in multiple jurisdictions nationwide have voted well over two-dozen times on Election Day in favor of marijuana legalization measures.
Currently, 34 states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books regulating the production and..."
"Jan Dell, the outspoken recycling critic and thorn in the side of the plastics industry, wants the American public to face facts.  
Those grocery-bag drop-off boxes, she says, are glorified trash bins. That swirly recycling symbol on coffee lids and granola pouches is more fantasy than fact. Clear plastic bottles are recyclable: green ones are not.  
“You walk in a Walmart and see all these single-use Halloween decorations,” Dell said. “All that will be in a landfill the week after Halloween.”

"The left of the Democratic Party is pinning its hopes on a primary victory on Tuesday to ease the pain of some recent disappointments.
Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who served as a high-profile surrogate for Sen.

The seat was previously held by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge.
Turner is backed by Sanders — who campaigned for her over the weekend — as well..."
"An investigation has been launched after a Texas police officer shot and killed a woman during an arrest after she shouted, “I’m pregnant.”
The officer from the Baytown Police Department was patrolling the area around The Brixton Apartments on Garth Road on the evening of May 13 when he came across a 45-year-old woman who he recognized as having outstanding warrants.
According to the department, the officer then deployed a Taser against the woman while attempting to detain her following a struggle.

"The battle over abortion rights in the US shifted rapidly to Congress and the midterm elections after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade and gutted the decades-old constitutional protection for women seeking to end a pregnancy.
As conservative states began to implement new abortion restrictions across the country in the wake of Friday’s ruling, Democrats on Capitol Hill and running for national office called for abortion rights to be protected through legislation, and sought to depict Republicans as dangerously out of step with average Americans heading into the November..."
"Deadly Hurricane Ian was downgraded to Tropical Storm Ian on Thursday morning and moved off Florida’s East Coast by 11 a.m., but was still dumping record amounts of rain to bring “catastrophic flooding” to the region.
Rising floodwaters led to home rescues and stranded vehicles across Central Florida, and area’s first fatalities were reported in Lake and Volusia while the statewide toll has yet to be determined after hurricane’s storm surge devastated the Gulf Coast."
"Members of Congress and some of their staff are about to get personal experience with the Affordable Care Act.
The law says they will cease to be eligible for federal government employees' heath-insurance plan on Jan. 1. So starting Monday, lawmakers and their aides will be able to sign up for health insurance through a special section of an online marketplace being run by the District of Columbia.
A provision of the Affordable Care Act says lawmakers and their aides must get coverage using the new health-insurance exchanges, or marketplaces,..."
"The entire country is now under a major disaster declaration for the coronavirus pandemic after the U.S. death toll reached the highest in the world on Saturday.

"A forensic pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein's brother to look into his suicide said on Wednesday that the convicted sex offender's body showed a number of signs of homicide, contradicting a medical examiner ruling that Epstein's death was a suicide.
Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who has been hired Epstein’s brother to look into the matter, offered the remarks on “Fox & Friends.”"
"The science around the link between children and the spread of the coronavirus is still evolving, but a growing body of evidence suggests that kids attending school do play an important role in community transmission.
The issue comes as the resurgent spread of Covid-19 has prompted most of Europe to adopt the strictest level of public health measures, with many countries in the region shutting schools as part of a broader plan to curb infection rates and alleviate the strain on already stressed health facilities."
"Being Jewish is no reason not to celebrate Christmas, says the writer Howard Jacobson - although he draws the line at putting up a tree.
""What does Christmas mean to you?"" was the title of an essay we were asked to write in our final year of primary school. I wrote that it meant seeing my father dressed as Santa Claus, getting stuck coming down the chimney. My teacher thought I must have made that up. ""Isn't your family, er...?"" she asked.
""Yes,"" I replied. ""We are, er......"
"Online betting markets now give Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) the edge to win the White House in 2024, overtaking former President Trump in the wake of Tuesday’s midterm elections.

"The U.S. Senate will grapple on Tuesday with whether to increase payments to Americans reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and override President Donald Trump’s veto of a $740 billion defense bill, two measures set to lapse if lawmakers fail to act before a new Congress takes office on Sunday.
Democrats, with help from Trump’s Twitter feed, are pushing for a vote on the additional money, a step they believe could give them an advantage in two Georgia runoff elections next week that will determine which party controls the Senate under..."
"An executive assistant to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has broken her anonymity and called for accountability over his alleged sexual harassment.
Brittany Commisso's claims were first detailed in a report which found Mr Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women.

An inquiry by Attorney General Letitia James's office last week found that Mr Cuomo's..."
"ederal laws imposing a minimum age of 21 to purchase handguns from licensed dealers violate the Second Amendment, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
Why it matters: The ruling could have implications for efforts to restrict gun sales nationally in the future, the Washington Post reports.
The big picture: A three-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the restrictions unconstitutional, with the opinion stating that 18-year-olds possess a Second Amendment right to gun ownership."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders released letters from his primary physician and two cardiologists on Monday stating that the 2020 candidate ""has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the Presidency.""

"A bloc of House conservatives on Friday pressed Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to force a floor vote by next week to oust Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for blocking two Republicans from serving on the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.
Such a vote on what’s known as a “motion to vacate the chair” would be quickly rejected by Democrats, who control the majority, and some moderate Republicans.
But the one-page letter from the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus represents a test for McCarthy, who likely will need Freedom Caucus support in his quest..."
"BIARRITZ, France (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would probably host next year’s Group of Seven summit of the major industrialized countries at one of his own properties - the Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami - but insisted he would not personally profit from the resort’s selection."
"I’m a fan of the New England Patriots, and in the circles that I move in — liberal, underdog-loving, far from New England — that’s a bad thing to be. One hears that the team’s coach, Bill Belichick, wrote Donald Trump a commendatory letter not long before the president took office. One hears that a Make America Great Again hat was seen hanging near the locker of the quarterback Tom Brady. President Trump and Robert Kraft, the team owner, were once big buddies and may well be again."
"Firefighters led a protest in Marseilles, France, on Saturday ahead of the nation's vaccine passport—which will require people to be vaccinated in order to use public transportation or attend public venues including cinemas and cafes—going into effect on Monday.
Video posted on Twitter shows the firefighters—some wearing masks—carrying the French flag while walking through Marseille, the second largest city in the nation.
Other videos depict similar protests across the nation. Videos show more than 60,000 people marching through Paris and carrying signs and flags while flanked by police officers.

"Federal law enforcement suspected former President Trump had violated the Espionage Act and other laws when it sought and obtained a search warrant for his Mar-a-Lago estate, according to court records unsealed Friday.
The unsealed warrant shows that investigators were authorized to seize any documents or records with classified markings or related to the “transmission of national defense information or classified material.”
The warrant also authorized the seizure of “any evidence of the knowing alteration, destruction, or concealment of any government and/or Presidential Records, or of any documents with classification markings.”"
"A bomb attack targeting the funeral prayer service for the mother of the Taliban’s chief spokesman killed at least three people in Kabul’s main mosque Sunday afternoon, in the first major militant strike on the Afghan capital since U.S. forces withdrew in August.
The Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, and other members of the Taliban leadership were inside the mosque and weren’t hurt in the bombing, which occurred at the entrance to the Eid Gah Mosque in the heart of Kabul, officials said. The death toll was likely to increase.
While there..."
"Reading scores for elementary school students plunged to their lowest levels since 1990 during the first two years of the pandemic — and math scores dropped for the first time in the history of a nationally representative test dating back to the 1970s.
Why it matters: The national test results out Thursday lay out the extent to which the pandemic devastated learning outcomes for America's students, particularly for those that were most vulnerable even before the pandemic.

If the FDA accepts the nonbinding recommendation from the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee — which is expected — it would mark a pivotal moment in the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 15.4 million people and killed roughly..."
"The stakes could not have been higher for Kamala Harris as she made history to formally accept the Democratic vice-presidential nomination. How did she do?
Only three women have been on the top ticket for a major party before, and none has made it to the White House.
The California senator, who spoke in an almost empty auditorium in Delaware, is also the first African American and Asian American to be nominated.
We asked voters and experts to assess her perfomance."
"A much-anticipated conservative revolt against incumbent Republicans never fully materialized here in Kentucky, allowing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to build a commanding position ahead of Tuesday's GOP primary by fully embracing his role as a Washington power broker.
A McConnell victory over Louisville businessman Matt Bevin, which is considered likely, would send a resounding signal to Republicans elsewhere that incumbency and deal-making are no longer the millstones many conservatives claimed them to be as the tea party gained strength in recent years.

"The Biden administration published its vaccinate mandate for businesses on Thursday, setting a Jan. 4 deadline in line with healthcare workers and employees of federal contractors. 
The administration said it was on strong legal grounds with the rule, which an official noted is not technically a vaccine mandate, as businesses can also choose to make regular testing and mask wearing an option. 
The mandate, which applies to businesses with at least 100 employees and is expected to cover 84 million people, was developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

"Unvaccinated people are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with Covid-19 than people who are fully vaccinated, a new study suggests, underscoring the importance of vaccines in containing the pandemic.
The study, published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at nearly 250 patients in Kentucky who had Covid-19 in 2020 and tested positive again between May and June 2021. The authors compared the vaccination status of those patients with those of nearly 500 similar people who also had an infection in 2020 but hadn’t been..."
"While there is much to celebrate about the return of students and teachers to classrooms, the transition back is highlighting the extraordinary impact the pandemic has had — and continues to have — on students’ mental health.
Only a few months into what was meant to be the “back to normal” school year, many educators I’ve spoken with are saying this year is more challenging than the last two. Their students are anxious about making friends. Some need help grieving the loss of loved ones who passed. And some are..."
"U.S. corporations face growing pressure and threats of boycotts to publicly oppose Republican-backed election legislation in Georgia and other states that critics say harm the voting rights of Black Americans.
The opposition intensified on Friday when Major League Baseball announced it would no longer hold the 2021 All-Star Game in Atlanta this summer, with commissioner Robert Manfred saying the league “fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.”
GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed an election overhaul bill into law that adds..."
"Seattle police are working to clear out a protest zone in the city that has become “lawless and brutal” after weeks of violence, including four shootings and the deaths of two teenagers, the city’s police chief said on Wednesday.
The move came after Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan declared the gathering of people in and around the police department’s East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park an “unlawful assembly,” the city’s police chief, Carmen Best, said in a statement.
The East Precinct was abandoned weeks ago after protesters clashed with Seattle police..."
"The Biden administration is considering creating a new immigration program for Venezuelans that would allow them to enter the country legally provided they have a U.S.-based financial sponsor, according to a government official familiar with the deliberations, a move designed to discourage Venezuelans from crossing into the U.S. illegally."
"The leaders of the world's richest economies have agreed to pursue efforts to limit global warming with ""meaningful and effective actions"".
But the agreement from the G20 summit in Rome made few concrete commitments, disappointing activists.
Host nation Italy had hoped that firm targets would be set before the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which has now begun.
UK PM Boris Johnson, who is hosting COP26 said leaders' promises without action were ""starting to sound hollow"".
""These commitments... are drops in a rapidly warming ocean,"" Mr Johnson said.
The G20 group, made..."
"Dallas-based Southwest Airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights over the weekend, leaving passengers stranded across the country.
Why it matters: The mass cancellations come after its pilots asked a court to block the company's new COVID vaccine mandate.
Between the lines: Airline insiders and conservatives are are wondering if the cancellations are part of a ""sick out"" in response to the vaccine policy.
Southwest's pilots' union said the cancellations were not part of a planned labor demonstration.
More than 25% of the airline's flights were canceled on Sunday per the FlightAware tracker.
""We can say with confidence that our..."
"Cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK have been confirmed in several European countries as well as Canada and Japan.
Infections linked to people who arrived from the UK were reported in Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and France.
A couple found infected in Ontario, Canada, had no known travel history or high-risk contacts, officials say.
Japan is to ban most non-resident foreign nationals from entering the country for a month from Monday."
"U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held their first telephone call as leaders and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a “disaster” for both nations.
While Xi has called for “win-win” cooperation, Biden has called China America’s “most serious competitor” and vowed to “out compete” Beijing.
On Thursday, Biden told a bipartisan group of U.S. senators at an Oval Office meeting to discuss the need to upgrade U.S. infrastructure that the United States must raise its game in..."
"The leader of Egypt's military ousted President Mohammed Morsi from office and replaced him with the head of the country's constitutional court—a move the presidential palace quickly branded a ""complete military coup.""
The announcements capped days of political crisis that brought millions of Egyptians out to the country's streets, spurring bellicose rhetoric from Mr. Morsi's backers and Egypt's military, and sparking deadly violence. Egyptians remained on the squares"
"A series of blasts tore through churches and international hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter morning, killing at least 207 people and wounding more than 450 in a coordinated series of attacks on tourists and the country’s minority Christian community.
At least eight explosions, most attributed to suicide bombers, took place across the country, turning restaurants and prayer halls that moments earlier were hosting joyful services and holiday feasts into chaos of rubble, broken furniture, shards of glass and the wounded and dead.
Seven people were arrested in Colombo in..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he is ready to pursue a new nuclear arms deal with Russia and called on Moscow to act in good faith as his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said there could be no winners in any nuclear war.
Both leaders issued written statements as diplomats gathered for a month-long U.N. conference to review the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It was supposed to take place in 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It occurs at a time of nuclear..."
"Hundreds of US public officials, police officers and soldiers are or have been involved with the far-right Oath Keepers militia, according to a report from an anti-extremism organisation.
The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism compared the names from a leak of Oath Keepers membership rolls with public records and social media.
Some alleged members have denied any affiliation with the group.
Oath Keepers are accused of playing a key role in last year's Capitol riots.
The report raises fresh concerns about the presence of extremist ideology in law enforcement and..."
"Thousands of Canadian truckers and their supporters have descended on Ottawa to protest Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's COVID-19 vaccine mandates, bringing the country's capital to a standstill.
After a week-long drive across Canada a huge ""Freedom Convoy"" of big rigs arrived in Ottawa late on Friday afternoon, blocking roads and causing chaos in Canada's capital. Truckers are protesting a vaccine mandate for the industry brought in by Trudeau, whereby truckers will have to be vaccinated to cross the Canadian-U.S. border. Under the measures, which were implemented on January 15, unvaccinated cross-border..."
"MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in December 2017 aired a special report on the Trump-Russia dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. That document, claimed Maddow, relied on information coming from Steele’s “deep cover sources inside Russia.”
A federal indictment unsealed Thursday has something to say about the quality of those “sources.”
It charges Igor Danchenko, the dossier’s primary intelligence collector, with making false statements to the FBI about his interactions with sources consulted for the dossier. Danchenko isn’t a deep-cover type; he’s a Russian national living in the..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots.
The justices turned away appeals by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and Republican members of the state legislature of a ruling by Pennsylvania’s top court ordering officials to count mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later.
Three of..."
"Thousands of Cubans took to the streets in a wave of demonstrations in Havana and at least 14 other cities throughout the Communist island, demanding an end to the 62-year dictatorship and protesting the lack of food and Covid-19 vaccines.
“We are not afraid! We are not afraid!” people shouted as they marched through the streets on Sunday, videos posted on social media showed. “Freedom! Freedom!”
The protests are unprecedented in a country with tight police control and surveillance on dissidents, analysts say.
In a televised address on Sunday, President Miguel..."
"As Election Day draws closer, Americans are being inundated with polls about the state of the presidential race. And, understandably, many are wondering whether polls can be trusted after Donald Trump’s surprise victory in 2016.
A better question to ask may be what, exactly, are we trusting polls to do? If the answer is to predict the future, then trust in polls is misplaced. But if the answer is to reveal the public’s priorities and values – and why people vote the way they do – then polls are the..."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has resigned from office after a bombshell report released by state Attorney General Letitia James (D) found he sexually harassed 11 women, including some who worked in his office, and violated state and federal laws.
Cuomo had been inundated with calls for his resignation and faced an impeachment hearing in the state Assembly that appeared all but guaranteed to spark a trial in the state Senate. Should he have survived potential impeachment proceedings, he also faced daunting reelection prospects in 2022.
But he appeared defiant to the end."
"Memorial Day is an opportunity to reflect on and honor those who gave their lives in the service of the U.S. Today, many Americans will visit the graves of the millions of soldiers buried in national cemeteries, including Fort Logan in Denver and Pikes Peak in Colorado Springs. 
This year, while honoring those fallen service members, I encourage you to pause and think about another group of veterans – the unclaimed. 
An unclaimed veteran is a member of the military who has passed away without anyone coming to claim their remains...."
"The Islamic State (IS) group has welcomed the death of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force.
In a statement, it described the general's demise as an act of divine intervention that benefitted jihadists. However, it made no mention at all of the US, which carried out the deadly drone strike against Soleimani in Baghdad on 3 January.
President Donald Trump's decision to assassinate Gen Soleimani set off a chain of consequences - one of the first was on the unfinished war against jihadists."
"US President Donald Trump has sued two banks in a bid to stop them handing over his financial records to Congress.
The lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One was filed after Democrat-led committees issued subpoenas for information on his finances.
His three eldest children and the Trump Organisation joined the lawsuit, which argues there are no legitimate grounds for investigating his business affairs.
Leading Democrats said they would not be deterred by the blocking attempt.
A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman told the New York Times: ""We remain committed to providing..."
"Amazon.com Inc. employees in Alabama voted not to unionize, handing the tech giant a victory in its biggest battle yet against labor-organizing efforts that fueled national debate over working conditions at one of the nation’s largest employers.
An estimated 71% of the Bessemer, Ala., warehouse workers who cast ballots voted against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which on Friday finished counting all the votes that weren’t challenged. The federal agency has yet to certify the results but noted that the..."
"A law that bans abortions after six weeks, including in cases of rape and incest, went into effect in Texas on Wednesday.
Why it matters: The law, one the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., prohibits the practice after a fetal heartbeat is detected — before many people know they are pregnant.
It also incentivizes individuals to sue anyone suspected of helping a woman obtain an abortion — and awards at least $10,000 to people who do so successfully.
Driving the news: The American Civil Liberties Union and several abortion rights groups this week asked..."
"Biden’s role at Burisma Holdings Ltd has come under intense scrutiny following unsupported accusations by U.S. President Donald Trump that Joe Biden improperly tried to help his son’s business interests in Ukraine.
Interviews with more than a dozen people, including executives and former prosecutors in Ukraine, paint a picture of a director who provided advice on legal issues, corporate finance and strategy during a five-year term on the board, which ended in April of this year."
"The Delaware judge steering the lawsuit over Twitter Inc. and Elon Musk’s stalled $44 billion takeover said the billionaire chief executive of Tesla Inc. can amend his countersuit to incorporate allegations from a whistleblower complaint by the social-media company’s former head of security.
The judge denied Mr. Musk’s request to push back a trial over the deal in Delaware Chancery Court to November from Oct. 17.
In a decision Wednesday, the judge cited a Chancery Court rule in which leave to amend should be “freely given when justice so requires.”..."
"The mainstream media turned away. But online, President Trump's charges about Hunter Biden were by far the dominant storyline about the final presidential debate, according to exclusive NewsWhip data provided to Axios.
Coverage of business dealings by Joe Biden's son — and pre-debate allegations by one of his former business associates, Tony Bobulinski — garnered more than twice as much online activity (likes, comments, shares) as the runner-up.
The second-place topic — also pushed by Republicans — was the former vice president's comments on oil and fracking.
Why..."
"President Trump told reporters on Saturday that he took a test for COVID-19 on Friday night and the test is currently pending in a lab.
Why it matters: The president was exposed to multiple people who have tested positive for the virus.
The president has come in contact with at least two individuals who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to a memo shared close to midnight on Friday by Sean Conley, the president's physician."
"The Justice Department on Thursday accused Yale University of violating federal civil rights law by discriminating against Asian American and white undergraduate hopefuls.
Why it matters: The claim is an extension of the Trump administration's efforts to challenge race-based admissions policies at elite universities, and comes after a two-year investigation in response to complaints from students about the application process at some schools.
The Supreme Court has previously ruled on affirmative action, upholding the consideration of race in college admissions, per Reuters.
What they're saying: “There is no such..."
"Inflation eased in October as underlying price increases excluding energy and food slowed from a four-decade high.
The Labor Department on Thursday said that its consumer-price index increased 7.7% in October from the same month a year ago, the smallest 12-month increase since January 2022. The reading was down from 8.2% in September. June’s 9.1% inflation rate was the highest in four decades.
On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.4% in October from September, the same pace as the previous month. The CPI measures what consumers pay for goods and services...."
"A group of Republican senators is asking Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 1.17% to explain why it recently removed a book about transgender issues that had been on sale on the platform for about three years.
In a letter to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos dated Wednesday, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Mike Braun of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri said a book by conservative scholar Ryan T. Anderson, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” was no longer available on Amazon nor on its..."
"Charles Krauthammer says it right up front in his Washington Post column: “I’m not a global warming believer. I’m not a global warming denier.”
He does, however, challenge the notion that the science on climate change is settled and says those who insist otherwise are engaged in “a crude attempt to silence critics and delegitimize debate.”
How ironic, then, that some environmental activists launched a petition urging the Post not to publish Krauthammer’s column on Friday.
Their response to opinions they disagree with is to suppress the speech."
"As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout gains momentum, many countries are planning a gradual return to normal, opening borders and letting people back into restaurants, shops and sports venues after more than a year of on-off lockdowns.
Here are some of their plans, in alphabetical order:
AUSTRALIA
Australia, which plans to allow international travel from mid-2022, lifted a ban on its citizens returning from India on May 14.
BELGIUM
Belgium plans to ease nearly all lockdown measures from June 9 provided the momentum of its vaccination campaign continues and the number..."
"As quickly as mortgage rates are rising, the once red-hot housing market is cooling off. Home prices are still historically high, but there is concern now that they will ease up as well.
All of this has people asking: Is today’s housing market in the same predicament that it was over a decade ago, when the 2007-08 crash caused the Great Recession?
The short answer is: no. America’s housing market is in far better health today. That’s thanks, in part, to new lending regulations that resulted from that meltdown. Those..."
"In need of a political boost, President Joe Biden will sign a $1 trillion infrastructure bill on Monday at a ceremony expected to draw Democrats and some Republicans who were instrumental in getting the legislation passed.
The measure is expected to create jobs across the country by dispersing billions of dollars to state and local governments to fix crumbling bridges and roads, and expanding broadband internet access to millions of Americans.
The White House said on Sunday that Biden named former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu to supervise implementation of..."
"New data just released by the Department of Homeland Security shows U.S. officials will have made a record 2.4 million immigration arrests along the southern border by the end of this month. In President Joe Biden’s first year in office, officials made 1.73 million arrests.
Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers detained more than 203,000 migrants who crossed the U.S. Mexico border.
The newest data notes that migrants seeking legal asylum in the United States in recent months came from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. The newest data also shows how difficult it..."
"House Democrats are making another push to provide a fresh round of federally-funded unemployment benefits to replace the $600-a-week benefit that expired in July.
On Monday, Democrats unveiled a scaled-down version of the HEROES Act, their proposed stimulus package that passed in the House in May. Originally the package had a $3 trillion price tag. The revised version would cost $2.2 trillion.
It calls for extending the $600 weekly benefit through Jan. 2021 and a second round of $1,200 direct payments to households, both of which were included in the..."
"The FBI carried out a record number of background checks on individuals purchasing firearms last month as multiple mass shootings gained the nation's attention and sparked a conversation on America's gun policies.
The FBI says nearly 4.7 million Americans underwent background checks in connection with purchasing guns in March, CNN reported. That number was up almost 36 percent from February.
While CNN noted that background checks do not necessarily correlate directly to firearms sold, they do indicate that the volume of purchases has increased."
"President Trump on Tuesday shared an unfounded conspiracy theory that an incident in which an elderly man was pushed to the ground by police in Buffalo, N.Y., during a protest over the police killing of George Floyd could be a ""set up.""
The president cited right-wing One America News Network (OANN) in making the incendiary claim, which comes amid a national debate over police brutality.
""Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in..."
"Idaho Gov. Brad Little has signed into law two anti-transgender bills.
One bill would ban transgender girls and women from participating in sports that align with their gender identity. The other bill would make it illegal for transgender people to change gender markers on their Idaho birth certificates.
Little signed the bills Monday afternoon. He didn’t issue signing statements on either bill."
"Social media users are slamming former President Barack Obama after he was seen dancing without a mask at his 60th birthday party in Martha’s Vineyard on Saturday night. 
Rapper Trap Beckham and his manager, TJ Chapman, posted photos taken from the celebrity-packed event, including pictures showing themselves smoking marijuana, which is legal in Massachusetts.
Erykah Badu, an American singer-songwriter, also posted video footage on her Instagram story that showed the former president grooving on the dance floor without wearing a face mask, as reported by the New York Post.
The guests..."
"Group of Seven leaders pledged on Sunday to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over five years to finance needed infrastructure in developing countries and counter China's older, multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road project.

Biden said the United States would mobilize $200 billion in grants, federal funds and private investment over five years to support projects in..."
"Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist and San Francisco hedge-fund founder, said he is ending his Democratic presidential bid after pouring more than $250 million of his personal fortune into it.
“I said if I didn’t see a path to winning that I’d suspend my campaign, and honestly, I can’t see a path where I can win the presidency,” Mr. Steyer said late Saturday, after coming in third in South Carolina’s primary, where he had spent much of his time and resources."
"The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed likely to weaken abortion rights and perhaps to let states ban the procedure altogether.
The intrigue: The court seemed likely to throw out the framework established in Roe v. Wade, but it wasn't clear whether a majority of the justices were inclined to overturn the court's precedents entirely.
The big picture: The court heard oral arguments this morning in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case challenging a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks. Mississippi seemed likely to win, one way or another...."
"The Supreme Court on Tuesday endorsed the U.S. government’s authority to detain immigrants awaiting deportation anytime - potentially even years - after they have completed prison terms for criminal convictions, handing President Donald Trump a victory as he pursues hardline immigration policies.
The court ruled 5-4 along ideological lines, with its conservative justices in the majority and its liberal justices dissenting, that federal authorities could place such immigrants into indefinite detention anytime without the possibility of bail, not just immediately after they finish prison sentences.
The ruling, authored by conservative..."
"President Trump said Friday he would withdraw the U.S. as a signatory to a global arms treaty that President Obama supported but Congress never ratified.
“We will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone,” Mr. Trump declared at a speech before the National Rifle Association in Indianapolis.
The Arms Trade Treaty seeks to regulate the international sale of conventional weapons. It was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 and signed that year by Mr. Obama, but the pact has never been ratified by Congress. Mr. Trump signed a..."
"Twitter permanently suspended an account belonging to Project Veritas on Thursday, citing repeat violations of the site's policies against publishing private information.
A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to The Hill that the main Project Veritas account was permanently suspended, while founder James O'Keefe had his account temporarily locked. Several recent tweets on O'Keefe's timeline appeared to have been deleted by Thursday afternoon.
Twitter did not immediately return a request for comment regarding private information shared by Veritas and O'Keefe.
Founded in 2010, Project Veritas is a right-wing group that routinely published..."
"The latest Military Times poll shows a continued decline in active-duty service members’ views of President Donald Trump and a slight but significant preference for former Vice President Joe Biden in the upcoming November election among troops surveyed.
The results, collected before the political conventions earlier this month, appear to undercut claims from the president that his support among military members is strong thanks to big defense budget increases in recent years and promised moves to draw down troops from overseas conflict zones.
But the Military Times Polls, surveying active-duty..."
"The House passed Democrats' revised $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill 214-207 on Thursday as 11th-hour negotiations between leaders for a bipartisan deal continue.
Why it matters: The legislation, a slimmed down version of the House's initial $3.4 trillion HEROES Act, is Democrats' last ditch effort to strike a stimulus deal with the White House and Senate Republicans before Election Day, though many lawmakers admit they think the legislation has little chance of becoming law."
"A US federal investigation has been launched into policing practices in the city of Minneapolis, a day after one of its former officers was convicted of the murder of George Floyd.
The justice department will look at whether there has been a pattern ""of unconstitutional or unlawful policing"", Attorney General Merrick Garland said.
It follows national outrage over the killing of Mr Floyd by Derek Chauvin.
The former officer was convicted of all charges against him on Tuesday.
Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine..."
"The group of Venezuelan migrants flown from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) filed a class-action suit against the governor and the state’s transportation secretary on Tuesday.
The suit provides a detailed account of how the migrants came to board the two planes allegedly under false pretenses, arguing the relocations violated their Fourth and 14th Amendment rights and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
“These immigrants, who are pursuing the proper channels for lawful immigration status in the United States, experienced cruelty akin to what they fled..."
"US President Donald Trump has accused his French counterpart of ""foolishness"" over a digital services tax levied by France, hinting that he would tax French wine in retaliation.
Mr Trump voiced his anger in a Tweet directed at the French President, Emmanuel Macron.
France's 3% tax is to be levied on sales generated by multinational firms like Google.
The Trump administration argues that it unfairly targets US tech giants.
""France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home..."
"A federal judge in Texas on Friday invalidated an Obama-era initiative that provided deportation protections and work permits to some young immigrants, a ruling that places the program in jeopardy.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was unlawful because Congress never gave the executive branch the power to grant mass reprieves to immigrants who are in the U.S. without authorization.
“As popular as this program might be, the proper origination point for the DACA program was, and is, Congress,” Judge Hanen, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote...."
"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Monday she had “robust” talks with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on the need to fight corruption to help deter undocumented immigration from Central America to the United States.
At a news conference with Giammattei, Harris said a U.S. task force would work with local prosecutors to punish corrupt actors in the region.
The Biden administration has identified corruption as an underlying cause of the poverty and violence driving record numbers of Central Americans to go to the United States
In the build up..."
"The United States on Thursday imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, to punish it for interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber-hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged ""malign"" actions.
The U.S. government blacklisted Russian companies, expelled Russian diplomats and barred U.S. banks from buying sovereign bonds from Russia's central bank, national wealth fund and finance ministry. Washington also warned the Kremlin that more penalties were possible though the United States said it did not want to escalate.
Moscow reacted angrily, saying..."
"Worker filings for initial jobless claims have dropped by 35% since late April, slipping below 400,000 last week for the first time since the pandemic started.
Weekly unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell to 385,000 last week from a revised 405,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Last week’s decline in claims marked the fifth straight week that new filings fell, from 590,000 in late April, adding to signs of a healing labor market as the U.S. economy ramps up.
Economists separately expect that the May employment report,..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A hacking group that appears to be linked to the Iranian government attempted to break into President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, but did not succeed, sources familiar with the operation said on Friday.
Earlier in the day, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said that an unnamed presidential campaign was targeted by hackers, which the software company linked to Iran.
The Trump campaign’s Director of Communications Tim Murtaugh said, “We have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.”"
"Donald Trump Jr’s early evening prediction of a “bloodbath” at the midterm elections did not come to pass, with the race to control Congress still tight early Wednesday as Democrats defied expectations by pulling off victories in several battleground states, while a number of right-wing Republican candidates fizzled out.
Both chambers of Congress are still in play early Wednesday, despite late polling suggesting blowout victories for the Republicans riding a so-called “Red Wave.”
While control of the Senate hangs in the balance, Republicans have not yet managed to gain a..."
"Twitter adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan, often called a “poison pill,” a day after billionaire Elon Musk offered to buy the company for $43 billion, the company announced Friday.
The board voted unanimously to adopt the plan.

"Wildfires raging across acres of arid land in California—which have left at least two dead and destroyed homes with thousands more still at risk—are pumping out smoke so thick that the pollution is even choking a neighboring state.
The two biggest blazes were still burning Monday morning after fire crews tackled the infernos—dubbed Fairview and Mosquito after their source locations—over the weekend amid the state's heat wave.

The state's firefighting agency, Cal Fire, has published maps detailing..."
"Twitter announced Friday that the platform will permanently suspend President Trump's account effective immediately.
Driving the news: It's Twitter's strongest-ever action against the president's account and comes in response to the ""risk of further incitement of violence,"" per the company. The move comes after Wednesday's siege at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob as Congress was set to certify Electoral College votes for Joe Biden.
""In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result..."
"Some people have finished their Christmas shopping early, worried that the special gift they’d been eyeing might be in short supply. Yet others are rediscovering another type of gift that is never held up on an unloaded cargo ship or stuck in a clogged supply chain. 
It is an act of kindness. Reminders of this deeper spirit of Christmas are not hard to find.
Most of them are quite public. Nova Scotia, for example, has sent a giant Christmas tree to Boston each year in gratitude for that city’s act..."
"Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives secured enough votes on Thursday to pass legislation setting up next steps in the fast-moving impeachment process involving Republican President Donald Trump.
The vote is the first formal test of support for the inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched on Sept. 24. The impeachment inquiry focuses on whether Trump pressured Ukraine into helping him in his 2020 re-election campaign, a charge the president denies."
"NIAID director Anthony Fauci told CNN on Monday the U.S. could ""start getting back to a degree of normality"" by next spring if more Americans are vaccinated against COVID-19.
Yes but: ""There's no guarantee, because it's up to us,"" Fauci said in his interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, noting that another variant could emerge unless the current surge is brought under control.
The big picture: The Delta variant is driving a spike in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations across the country.
Fauci told Cooper that the U.S. should get ""some good control in the spring..."
"Israeli forces attacked the Gaza Strip on Thursday, marking a new level of conflict in the region amid days of escalating violence.
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) tweeted Thursday (on the East Coast of the U.S.) about the operation, writing that ""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip.""
The move follows days of scattered airstrikes and rocket barrages between Hamas and the Israeli military.
“There are ground troops attacking in Gaza, together with air forces, as well,"" an Israeli military spokesman added to The..."
"On Wednesday, ABC News suspended correspondent David Wright after Project Veritas caught him on an undercover camera criticizing his network and expressing his own political views while covering the New Hampshire primary election.
Let’s point out that the video Project Veritas posted is edited, so we may not have all the context we might want about this conversation. But since ABC responded with a suspension, it is safe to assume the network is not questioning the basic facts the video presents.
And therein lies the lesson that journalists seem to..."
"Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced the first major bipartisan legislation aimed at taming the “Wild West” crypto market on Tuesday that would classify digital assets as commodities like wheat or oil and empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to rein in the nascent industry.
Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Lummis, a first-term Republican from Wyoming on the Banking Committee, said the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is the culmination of months of collaboration in the House and Senate and represents a critical first attempt to structure the markets..."
"President Joe Biden on Sunday signed an executive order aimed at helping to ensure all Americans have the right to vote by increasing access to voter registration services and information.
Biden also called for Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law in 1965 following a violent protest in Selma, Alabama, that left some participants injured.
The late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who was one of the activists leading the march, suffered a fractured skull. Lewis passed away last year.
Biden’s executive order coincides with the..."
"The Biden administration on Thursday plans to restart the ""Remain in Mexico"" program following a court order to reimplement the policy first launched under President Trump while it appeals the decision.
The rollout follows weeks of negotiations with Mexico over how to reimplement a plan that under the Trump administration saw as many as 70,000 migrants from across the globe pushed into refugee camps in border cities with no clear timeline for when they may be able to enter the U.S. for a hearing in their case.
The mass migration through Mexico..."
"Senators wrapped up the construction of a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill, racing to pass it through the chamber by the end of the week and send it to the House, where its fate is intertwined with a $3.5 trillion package of Democratic priorities.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) kept the Senate open through the weekend in a bid to begin considerations of the bipartisan infrastructure package, $550 billion of which is in addition to expected future federal investments in roads, bridges, broadband, and other infrastructure projects. But lawmakers..."
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court seemed unlikely to deliver a major win for gun-rights activists during arguments on Monday in the first significant Second Amendment case the justices have heard in nearly a decade.
The case was challenging a New York City gun regulation that barred the transport of handguns outside of the city, even to a second home or firing range. After the court agreed to hear the case, though, the city did away with the regulation and the state passed a law that prevented the city from reviving..."
"The Vatican said on Monday that priests and other Catholic Church ministers cannot bless same-sex unions and that such blessings are “not licit” if carried out.
The Vatican’s doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), issued the ruling in response to questions and moves in some parishes to impart such blessings as a sign of welcome to gay Catholics since the Church does not permit homosexual marriage.
Pope Francis approved the response, the CDF said, adding that it was “not intended to be a form of..."
"Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has retained power in a narrow Canadian election win but he will now be prime minister of a minority government.
The Liberals are projected to win 157 seats, 13 short of a majority, and will find it harder to pass legislation in Mr Trudeau's second term.
The opposition Conservatives are expected to win the popular vote but have not translated that into seats."
"Buildings at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine - the largest in Europe - have been damaged after it was hit by shelling.
The attack has prompted world leaders to accuse Russia of acting recklessly. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe"".
What happened to the power plant?
Russia attacked Zaporizhzhia with shelling, and later took control of the plant.
Buildings around one of its six power units have been damaged, according to Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate.
The UN's nuclear watchdog,..."
"Washington State's Democratic Governor Jay Inslee has announced his 2020 bid for the presidential nomination, joining a lengthy list of contenders.
Mr Inslee, 68, will make climate change his number one issue, calling it ""the most urgent challenge of our time"" in his first campaign video.
He is the first governor to throw his hat into the ring, joining 12 other Democrats, including six senators.
The two-term governor has been a fierce critic of President Donald Trump.
""I'm running for president because I am the only candidate who will make..."
"As Russia rains relentless fire on Ukrainian cities, the country’s leaders have been pleading for more Western help. But the United States is rightly wary of a proposal to send the Ukrainians MiG-29 fighter jets — a move that would bring small benefits on the battlefield and entail large risks of a wider war.
The dilemma of how to help Ukraine without triggering a global conflict will only get more painful as Russian President Vladimir Putin keeps doubling down on his losing bet in Ukraine. The latest warning of Putin’s recklessness..."
"Beto O’Rourke has played games with the media before, but he got a last laugh of sorts — at least a wistful chuckle — by dropping out of the presidential race on Friday afternoon, sending political writers into a tizzy right before the weekend. And although his candidacy once had great promise, O’Rourke’s exit from the race came down to his weak poll numbers and reduced fundraising numbers, as well as the fact that he may never have had the base of support he needed to truly compete for the..."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday granted an emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine booster, though for now the FDA said use of the booster should be restricted to people over the age of 65, adults 18 and older at high risk of severe Covid, and those who, like health care workers, are at higher risk of infection because of their jobs. That list includes teachers.
With the agency’s ruling, the Biden administration is one step closer to implementing its plan to begin to offer booster..."
"Texans’ anger with Ted Cruz right now could power an entire electrical grid.
The outrage was sparked by viral images on social media Thursday showing Texas’ junior senator making his way through the airport, bag in tow, and boarding a flight to sunny Cancun as more than a million of his humble constituents shivered in the cold without power, heat, light, or in many cases, running water.
With the statewide death toll mounting into the dozens, snowmegeddon melted into catastrophe for struggling Texas families already on the brink amid a..."
"Faced with staggering unemployment numbers that are likely to remain elevated through the election, Senate Republicans are reversing their positions on ending a federal increase of state unemployment benefits after July.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed in a conference call with House Republicans last month that Senate Republicans would block the $600 weekly boost to state unemployment benefits from the federal government.
Also last month, GOP senators involved in planning for a phase four coronavirus relief bill said there was overwhelming support for entirely ending the federal enhancement..."
"I remember the moment well. It was 1971. I was 26 and living in Memphis, Tenn. I went to get the mail, like I did every day. But, this day was different because there was a letter notifying me that I had been drafted. That is why when people ask me if I volunteered to join the Army, I always say, “Yes, I volunteered. I volunteered to get the mail.”
Originally, I was ordered to go to Vietnam, but my orders changed at the last minute and I was instead..."
"A group of international experts — including, notably, two outgoing Food and Drug Administration vaccine regulators — argues in a new paper against offering Covid-19 vaccine boosters to the general population.
The paper, published Monday in the Lancet, is based on a review of available data about the durability of vaccine protection. That it was co-authored by Marion Gruber and Phil Krause, two veteran FDA officials who have been leading the agency’s review of Covid-19 vaccine applications, amounts to a strikingly direct rebuff to the Biden administration as it lays plans for..."
"Iran's most senior nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh has been assassinated near the capital Tehran, the country's defence ministry has confirmed.
Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after an attack in Absard, in Damavand county.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, has condemned the killing ""as an act of state terror"".
Western intelligence agencies view Fakhrizadeh as being behind a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme.
""If Iran ever chose to weaponise (enrichment), Fakhrizadeh would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb,"" one Western diplomat told Reuters news agency in 2014.

"The United States surpassed 3 million coronavirus infections on Wednesday, a grim milestone as the virus surges in more than half of all states, and a predicted waning of infections this summer never occurred.
Data from the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center showed the U.S. had 3,009,611 cases at midday on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the U.S. set a record with 60,000 new cases. California and Texas both had more than 10,000 new cases in a single day, shattering previous records.
Arizona, Florida, and South Carolina led the world..."
"Strong hiring in the manufacturing, transportation and warehousing and health-care sectors during April helped the U.S. economy notch its 12th straight month of job gains of 400,000 or more.
The U.S. economy added 428,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, the same gain as in March and following a jump of 714,000 in February and 504,000 in January.
Manufacturing, the industry that saw the largest one-month pop in job gains, added 55,000 jobs during the first month of the second calendar quarter.
Government economists said the majority of manufacturers’..."
"A federal judge on Monday dealt an eight-month prison sentence to Paul Hodgkins for the Florida man’s role in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack, making him the first among more than 500 people facing criminal charges in the riot to be incarcerated. 
Hodgkins, 38, pleaded guilty on June 2 to one felony count of obstruction of an official proceeding, as Congress was in the process of formally certifying Joe Biden’s election last November as U.S. president when supporters of then-President Donald Trump rampaged through the building.
Prosecutors had asked..."
"President Trump on Friday described protesters who surrounded the White House during the final night of the Republican National Convention as “thugs,” and suggested he was looking at invoking the Insurrection Act to send troops to quell protests in U.S. cities.
Trump, speaking at an outdoor campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., took a victory lap following his keynote address to the GOP convention from the White House on Thursday, before rebuking Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) for what he described as a failure to gain control of protests in..."
"President Trump on Monday lashed out at AFL-CIO President Richard Trumaka a day after the labor union leader criticized Trump's trade deal in a Fox News interview.
Trump, in a Labor Day morning tweet, claimed that Trumka doesn't share the same critique of Trump's trade deal when ""he is with me at the White House.""
""Just watched AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on @FoxNews and thought to myself how different he is on TV than he is when he is with me at the White House. Likes what we are..."
"A patriot died Monday.  A man who proudly said, “I’m an American, first and foremost,” lived a life of integrity that stayed true to his statement. Colin Powell, 84, was extraordinary because he did something that we should all expect. Powell put country ahead of politics.
With Powell’s death Monday from COVID-19 complications amid his battle with cancer comes the loss of an important voice of reason for the Republican Party. His death is a loss to the country and the Black community. Powell was a trailblazer. He was the first Black secretary of State..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is still standing firm on its indoor mask guidelines, despite several Democratic states, including New York and California, lifting restrictions.
Democrat-run states are now joining forces with their red counterparts, rolling back mask mandates and opposing CDC guidance. California, Oregon, Delaware and New York have announced that they will be lifting their indoor mask mandates soon, joining other Democratic states like Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
New York though, will continue its indoor mask mandate for schools. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is..."
"The first flight from Operation Fly Formula landed in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday with enough specialty infant formula to fill more than half a million baby bottles.
The flight was greeted by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack upon arrival.
All formula pallets have been fully loaded onto FedEx trucks, but first comply with stringent Food and Drug Administration regulatory requirements. After the FDA clears the product, it will become available publicly for parents, caregivers and health care professionals."
"Gov. Greg Abbott and challenger Beto O’Rourke clashed over a range of topics Friday night in their sole debate, not always with the facts on their side.
Some fact-checks:
Abortion
Abbott depicted O’Rourke as an extremist on abortion.
“He not only supports abortion of a fully developed child to the very last second before birth” but, said Abbott, he opposes “providing medical care for the baby who survives an abortion. He is for unlimited abortion at taxpayer expense.”
O’Rourke insisted “that’s not true.”
The claim about denying medical care for a..."
"President Biden on Friday proposed a budget that would entrench deficits in excess of $1 trillion for the next decade, pushing the nation’s debt burden to record highs.
The blueprint released by the White House ties together three major spending proposals already announced by Biden: the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan and $1.5 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2022.
Combined with mandatory spending programs, the 2022 budget would spend $6 trillion, about $300 billion more than current projections for the year, with much of the spending going toward education,..."
"Former President Donald Trump’s blog — a webpage where he shared statements after larger social media companies banned him from their platforms — has been permanently shut down, his spokesman said Wednesday.
The page “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” has been scrubbed from Trump’s website after going live less than a month earlier.
It “will not be returning,” his senior aide Jason Miller told CNBC.
“It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,” Miller said via email."
"Private businesses in New York City will no longer be required to enforce COVID-19 vaccines starting Nov. 1, Mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday.
Why it matters: Private employers having more flexibility in their vaccine policies signals a shift into the next chapter of the pandemic, now that around 89% of NYC residents have already received at least one dose of the COVID vaccine, per the latest data.
What they're saying: “The new bivalent booster is here, providing better protection against variants we are seeing now and quite likely against variants in the future as well,"" Adams said in..."
"Dan Cox, a conservative state legislator endorsed by former President Donald Trump, won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Maryland on Tuesday over former state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz, the Associated Press projected.
The primary election outcome sets up what political analysts predict will be an uphill battle for Mr. Cox in the November general election, given that registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 in Maryland and that President Biden defeated Mr. Trump 65% to 32% in 2020.
Maryland, whose incumbent is outgoing moderate Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, is one of the few largely..."
"Former President Trump in a new interview warned Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) against running for president in 2024.
“I don’t know if he is running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly. I really believe he could hurt himself badly,” Trump told Fox News in an interview late Monday after a rally in Ohio. “I think he would be making a mistake. I think the base would not like it. I don’t think it would be good for the party.”
“Any of that stuff is..."
"A standard defense for Hillary Rodham Clinton when facing questions about Benghazi, Libya, has been to cite her commissioning of a report from the State Department’s Accountability Review Board (ARB), which took a deep look at the attacks that claimed the lives of four U.S. personnel on Sept. 11, 2012. In testimony before Congress in January 2013, Clinton said: “I hurried to appoint the Accountability Review Board led by Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen so we could more fully understand from objective, independent examination, what went wrong and how to..."
"Then-President Donald Trump was directly involved in efforts to use national security agencies to seize voting machines after his 2020 election loss, pressing his lawyer to make queries as advisers drafted two versions of a related executive order, media reports said.
The New York Times, citing three people familiar with the matter, reported on Monday that Trump directed Rudy Giuliani to call the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to determine whether it could legally take control of voting machines in key swing states.
That effort came amid two previously reported..."
"A new report from The New York Times suggests that former President Donald Trump was more directly involved with a plan to seize voting machines during the 2020 election than previously thought.
The New York Times report said that Trump directed his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to call the Department of Homeland Security to see if the DHS could legally control voting machines in three swing states.
Giuliani made the call to the department’s acting deputy secretary, who said he didn’t have such authority.
Trump also reportedly raised the possibility to Attorney General Bill..."
"Donald Trump spoke at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night to bolster Republican candidates Dr. Mehmet Oz and Doug Mastriano.
His first rally since the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump spent a good chunk of his speech attacking the bureau, the Department of Justice and President Joe Biden.
Speaking to supporters in Wilkes-Barre, Trump called Biden ""an enemy of the state"" and dubbed the DOJ ""vicious monsters.""
He also launched a fierce attack against John Fetterman, the Democrat running against Oz for U.S. Senate, branding him ""a..."
"Two staffers for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) resigned after expressing frustrations about a hold on military assistance to Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry, a witness has testified.
Mark Sandy, an OMB staffer, testified this month that the two staffers, one of whom was in the legal division, had resigned partially due to frustrations with the unexplained aid freeze, according to a transcript of his testimony released Tuesday.
Sandy recalled that one individual who resigned had ""expressed some frustrations about not..."
"President Joe Biden's administration is coordinating the development of a system that would give proof-of-vaccination to people who have been inoculated against the coronavirus, a senior administration official noted.
The White House is working with multiple government agencies, including the offices of Health and Human Services, along with technology and travel companies, to develop this vaccine passport system, the official told CNN.
“Our role is to help ensure that any solutions in this area should be simple, free, open source, accessible to people both digitally and on paper, and designed..."
"US firm Abbott says it is restarting production at a baby formula plant after its shutdown contributed to a national shortage of the baby food.
The plant in Michigan - one of America's largest - was closed in February because of contamination.
Coupled with global supply chain issues, the factory's closure led to acute shortages.
Parents were left scrambling for supplies, seeking formula from food banks, friends and doctor's offices.
Some turned to social media to try to track down baby milk, while others attempted to make their own substitutes..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday sided with a Wyoming hunter charged with off-season hunting, ruling 5-4 that a 150-year-old treaty between a Native American tribe and the United States was still active and protected the man's rights.
Clayvin Herrera was charged in 2014 with off-season hunting, but he argued that an 1868 treaty between the U.S. and the Crow Tribe — of which he is a member — protected his ability to hunt at that time.
Wyoming had argued that the treaty was invalidated when it achieved statehood and lower..."
"With over 100,000 Americans hospitalized for COVID-19 as a result of the highly contagious Omicron variant, the Supreme Court will hear oral argument Friday in two sets of challenges to the Biden administration’s authority to take action to combat the pandemic. In the first case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor, the justices will consider the Biden administration’s attempt to impose a vaccine-or-test mandate for workers at large employers. In the second case, Biden v. Missouri, they will consider a vaccine mandate for health care workers at facilities that receive federal..."

The vice president blasted the..."
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that growing consumer spending, industrial output, credit quality and other economic indicators don’t suggest the economy is in a recession, although she acknowledged that “way too high” inflation is straining the system.
“This is not an economy that is in recession,” Yellen told moderator Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” 
Businesses and consumers are seeing the economy slow after a rapid growth spurt last year, which brought the labor market back to life after the COVID-19 pandemic, the secretary said. But this transitional slowdown is “necessary and..."

"The former top Russia adviser at the White House at impeachment hearings Thursday criticized one of Rep. Devin Nunes’ defenses of President Donald Trump, calling the congressman’s repeated assertion that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election a “fictional narrative.”
“Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,” Fiona Hill testified. “This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security..."
"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s request for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden constitutes “a fundamental breach of the president’s oath of office.”
“To have a president of the United States suggesting, urging a foreign country to interfere in our presidential elections is an illustration that if this president has learned anything from the two years of [former special counsel Robert Mueller’s] investigation, it’s that he feels he can do anything with impunity,” Schiff told reporters on Capitol Hill.

"More than 100,000 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. in 2021, more than in any other year on record, according to provisional data released by the National Center for Health Statistics Wednesday.
Why it matters: The grim milestone, a 15% increase from overdose deaths in 2020, occurred during the coronavirus pandemic, which also killed over 415,000 in the country that year and almost 1 million in total so far.
The data presented is incomplete, as many deaths require more investigating to confirm a cause, though estimates rarely largely differ from the..."
"Three rockets reportedly hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Sunday, minorly injuring one person, a U.S. official told CNN.
A State Department spokesperson told The Hill on Sunday that they “are aware of reports of rockets landing in the International Zone” but did not mention the embassy or whether employees were injured.
“The security situation remains tense and Iranian-backed armed groups remain a threat. So, we remain vigilant,"" the spokesperson said, requesting the Iraqi government get involved to protect “diplomatic facilities.”"
"A Virginia jury ruled in favor of actor Johnny Depp in his case against Amber Heard, closing a widely watched and emotional trial centered on defamation and abuse accusations between the former couple.
The seven-member jury found Mr. Depp proved all three counts of defamation against his former spouse in an op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post in 2018, awarding him $15 million. The jury also found Ms. Heard was able to prove one of three counts of defamation against Mr. Depp, based on statements made by one of his attorneys. The jury awarded..."
"With nine weeks until the 2020 presidential election, several factors are unfolding that will likely determine whether President Trump will be reelected. One major factor is how the electorate has changed since 2016.
First, consider that the share of voters supporting third-party candidates is much smaller in 2020 than it was in 2016. In 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden has a 2-to-1 lead over Trump among those who voted for Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in 2016. One survey shows that 47 percent of Stein and Johnson supporters will..."
"The reviews are coming in for Senate Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and some analysts are suggesting the $739 billion healthcare, energy and tax package won’t actually reduce inflation by a great deal.
“We estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act will produce a very small increase in inflation for the first few years, up to 0.05 percent points in 2024. We estimate a 0.25 percentage point fall in the PCE price index by the late 2020s,” said Penn Wharton Budget Model analysts in a report, referring to the Federal Reserve’s..."
"It’s no secret that everything from groceries and gas, to airline tickets and rent is more expensive than it used to be, and many Americans are left wondering when prices will go back to “normal.”
The short answer is that it largely relies on a variety of factors influencing today’s record-high inflation — post-pandemic consumer demand, ongoing supply chain shortages, geopolitical events, the war in Ukraine — and there are various viewpoints on how most of these factors will unfold.
Here’s what the experts say about when prices may level out."
"Bay Area tech workers plan to flee San Francisco for the more affordable locale of ... New York City.

"A new report by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee alleges that the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""became a foreign asset"" for Russia ahead of the 2016 election.
The document published Friday says that the NRA and its officers, board members and donors ""engaged in a years-long effort to facilitate the U.S.-based activities of Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin,"" despite being aware of the two Russian nationals' ties to the Kremlin.
""The scope of the NRA’s support for these Russian activities raises concerns about whether the activity in which the..."

"President Biden on Tuesday gave his full-throated endorsement for changing Senate rules to allow federal voting rights legislation to pass via a simple majority instead of a 60-vote threshold.
Biden has in the past expressed an openness to tweaking Senate rules, such as reinstating the talking filibuster. But in Tuesday’s remarks, he made clear he supports changing the rules “whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights,"" setting the stage for a high stakes fight in the Senate.

Officials said the last C17 aircraft took off with the US ambassador onboard after midnight local time on Tuesday.
They added that the diplomatic mission to assist those unable to leave before the deadline would continue.
Celebratory gunfire by the Taliban was heard after the last plane departed.
The aircraft's departure was the final chapter in a contentious military effort, which eventually saw the US handing Afghanistan back..."

""Democracy has prevailed,"" he said after taking the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts.
Outgoing President Donald Trump, who has not formally conceded to Mr Biden, is not attending the ceremony.
The new president has announced a raft of executive orders aimed at reversing Mr Trump's key policies."
"News on Thursday that Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire, is actively preparing a White House run as a Democrat without officially plunging into the candidate pool momentarily complicated an increasingly unpredictable presidential race.
Bloomberg, 77, has for months signaled both his interest in trying to defeat President Trump and his willingness to holster his ambitions on the sidelines as long as former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to be the frontrunner and most viable opponent who could knock Trump out of the Oval Office.
Bloomberg’s..."
"The Council on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) should take action to ban TikTok, Brendan Carr, one of five commissioners at the Federal Communications Commission, told Axios in an interview.
Why it matters: It's the strongest language Carr has used to date to urge action on TikTok. With more than 200 million downloads in the U.S. alone, the popular app is becoming a form of critical information infrastructure — making the app's ownership by a Chinese parent company a target of growing national security concern.
The FCC has no..."
"The chief executives of Twitter and Google defended a law protecting internet companies before a Senate panel on Wednesday, a topic that has split U.S. lawmakers on ways to hold Big Tech accountable for how they moderate content on their platforms.
Twitter Inc’s Jack Dorsey and Google’s Sundar Pichai were probed about how they monitor and moderate political content online.
They told the committee chaired by Republican Senator Roger Wicker that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content posted by users -..."
"Former President Donald Trump hinted on Sunday at a possible presidential run in 2024, attacked President Joe Biden and repeated his fraudulent claims he won the 2020 election in his first major appearance since leaving the White House nearly six weeks ago.
Addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, Trump vowed to help Republicans try to regain majorities - lost during his presidency - in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate in 2022 congressional elections and dangled himself as a possibility for president in 2024.

"Mr Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checks, adding that his daughter had already been given it.
Officials have said they plan to start mass vaccination in October.
Experts have raised concerns about the speed of Russia's work, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners.
Amid fears that safety could have been compromised, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged Russia last week to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19.
On Tuesday, the WHO said it had been in talks with Russian authorities about undertaking..."
"News that Russia has registered the first vaccine to treat COVID-19 before starting and completing Phase 3 trials was greeted with alarm on Tuesday, with experts concerned it may come with safety issues that could stoke antivaccination and anti-science sentiment.
President Vladimir Putin announced the news of the vaccine at a government meeting, The Wall Street Journal reported, following accelerated trials conducted by the Gamaleya Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow in collaboration with the Defense Ministry.
Putin said one of his daughters has already received a dose of..."
"President Biden set his sights at the State of the Union on Russian oligarchs, COVID fraudsters, social media platforms and even defund-the-police efforts — populist targets in a broader speech about national and global unity.
Why it matters: Biden's anti-Russia, pro-Ukraine passages inspired the only real partisan unity in the chamber.
""The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We..."
"It didn't take long for problems to become clear on this month's second big day of voting.
But the challenges seemed almost entirely in one place: Georgia, by far the biggest of the five states with primaries Tuesday, and a rising presidential battleground after emerging as a singular focus of voting rights advocates for two years.
Thousands, especially in and around Atlanta, faced hours-long lines from the time the polls opened — and then were confronted by frequently malfunctioning equipment and diminished teams of inexperienced poll workers. Many others who..."
"The push in the U.S. Congress for a major new coronavirus aid bill got a post-election boost on Wednesday when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put his weight behind passage by the end of this year and opened the door to considering a key Democratic priority.
While candidates elected to the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives will not be sworn in until Jan. 3, the Congress that has been in business since January 2019, will return to Washington next week for a “lame duck” session that is expected to..."
"President Biden on Monday described the omicron variant of COVID-19 as a ""cause for concern"" but not a cause for panic, saying Americans getting vaccinated and getting their booster shots is the best defense against the virus.
He also said officials would release more guidance on how they plan to fight the spread of COVID-19 this winter, but promised it wouldn't include lockdowns.
""This variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,"" Biden said in prepared remarks at the White House. ""We have the best vaccine in the world, the..."
"(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging a law enacted by Alabama last week that bans nearly all abortions and makes performing the procedure a felony punishable by up to 99 years in prison.
The lawsuit is one of several the groups have filed or are preparing to file against states that recently passed strict anti-abortion measures in an effort to prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that guarantees a woman’s constitutional..."
"While there is some nice coverage about how print newspapers are covering the election results on their front pages - see Newspaper front pages cover Trump's victory – in pictures, we should also look at how it is being covered online. After all, these online sites are the primary news sources for many, many Americans."
"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has abandoned his plans to join the board of Twitter, his social network of choice.
Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced publicly Sunday that Musk remains the largest shareholder of Twitter, and the company will remain open to his input.
Musk informed Twitter on Saturday morning that he would not, in fact, take the board seat.
In premarket trading Monday, Twitter’s stock briefly tumbled more than 8% to less than $43 a share. Shares were up more than 2.5% after markets opened but fell nearly 1% to $45.82 a share just..."
"A senator for the state of Arkansas is defending comments he made on slavery in the United States.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton said US founders viewed slavery as a ""necessary evil upon which the union was built"".
His comments were criticised as an attempt justify the slavery of black people.
He is introducing legislation to ban federal funds for a project by the New York Times newspaper, aimed at revising the historical view of slavery.
The project's founder expressed outrage at the remarks."
"After many people on Twitter vilified Tom Cotton for reportedly calling slavery a “necessary evil” in a recent interview, the Republican senator clarified his remarks in a social media post of his own.
“This is the definition of fake news,” the Arkansas Republican wrote in a Twitter TWTR, -3.25% post on Sunday. “I said that *the Founders viewed slavery as a necessary evil* and described how they put the evil institution on the path to extinction, a point frequently made by Lincoln.”
Cotton was referring to an interview he gave..."
"A rapidly shrinking federal budget deficit is upending bipartisan talks to reach a federal budget deal, illustrating the conundrum Washington faces with an improving near-term fiscal outlook but continued longer-term pressures tied to aging baby boomers.
The Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday the federal deficit is expected to shrink to $642 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, narrowing from the agency's estimate of $845 billion three months ago and sharply lower than last year's $1.087 trillion shortfall."
"The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday deadlocked along party lines on moving forward on President Joe Biden's U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, with the full Senate still expected to confirm her later in the week as the first Black woman to serve on the nation's top judicial body.
The panel's 11-11 vote, with Biden's fellow Democrats in favor and Republicans united in opposition, pushes the confirmation battle into its next phase - a showdown on the Senate floor. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said shortly before the committee..."
"Hurricane Ida arrived in Louisiana Sunday every bit as ornery as advertised: 150 mph winds, some of the fiercest to ever hit American shores, bringing with them intense rainfall and storm surge that left a swath of carnage in its wake.
The massive storm, which arrived on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, sent rescuers scrambling to retrieve people from attics as flood waters poured into places like Lafitte, LaPlace and Braithwaite. The winds, matching the highest speeds ever recorded in Louisiana, tore roofs off homes, toppled transmission towers and..."
"The average price of U.S. retail gasoline fell below $4 per gallon on Thursday for the first time in months, giving some relief to drivers in the world's largest consumer of the fuel.
The national average price for regular unleaded gas fell to $3.990 a gallon on Aug. 11, according to the American Automobile Association.
Gasoline prices peaked at a record $5.02 in June. That high cost curbed spending, and prices have also dropped as market fears of severe restrictions on supply have ebbed since Russia first invaded Ukraine in..."
"The White House on Monday announced a program to extend mortgage relief and a moratorium on home foreclosures through June as thousands of Americans continue to struggle to keep up with payments during the coronavirus pandemic.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a housing affordability crisis,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Now, homeowners will receive urgently needed relief as we face this unprecedented national emergency. Today’s action builds on steps the President took on Day One to extend foreclosure moratoriums for federally guaranteed mortgages.""
The joint effort..."
"Police were searching on Monday for a suspected accomplice of the gunman who killed three people, including a 6-year-old boy, in a mass shooting at a food festival in California.
The gunman was shot dead by police officers within minutes of opening fire early on Sunday evening at the three-day Gilroy Garlic Festival, about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of the city of San Jose.
Among those killed was a 6-year-old boy, according to news reports. Fifteen people were injured, but it was unclear how many were shot or otherwise..."
"Federal officers on Thursday repeatedly drove demonstrators away from the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in downtown Portland in response to fires and damage to the building just hours after a security fence was removed.
Dozens of demonstrators assembled near the courthouse Thursday night, and some of them broke glass at the federal building and lit fires, according to reports from the scene.
A large contingent of federal officers responded by deploying impact munitions, tear gas, flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs, according to livestream videos from independent journalists and others..."
"Stacey Abrams apologized Tuesday for appearing maskless in several photos last week at a Georgia elementary school in violation of local mask mandates, two days after the Democratic candidate in Georgia’s governor race dismissed the Republican-led firestorm about the images as a “false political attack.”
During a Tuesday night appearance on CNN, Abrams said she was sorry for not wearing a mask in pictures that went viral over the weekend where she posed with masked students and children at a Decatur, Georgia school, breaking the city’s indoor mask mandate. 
Abrams called the maskless photos..."
"MINNEAPOLIS—Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sent in the National Guard as demonstrators clashed with police for a third straight day to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck in an incident captured on video.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has called for the police officers involved in the incident to be criminally charged, had requested the assistance."
"Americans on Tuesday will mark the first anniversary of the murder of George Floyd beneath a white Minneapolis police officer’s knee, which catalyzed the largest U.S. protest movement in decades over police brutality against Black people.
In Washington, President Joe Biden will meet privately with members of Floyd's family at the White House, not far from where promised police reform legislation in Floyd's name has stalled in the U.S. Congress.
In Minneapolis, a foundation created in Floyd's memory by some in his family has organized an afternoon of music and..."
"It’s perhaps America’s most intractable life-and-death dilemma: The mounting human – and increasingly public – toll of gun violence.
The Las Vegas Strip massacre became the deadliest such attack since the Thibodeaux Massacre in Louisiana and several other mass killings of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It comes just over a year after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., which killed 49 people and previously stood as the largest mass shooting in modern US history."
"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a bill on Tuesday that would ban abortion nationally after 15 weeks.
Driving the news: ""We will introduce legislation ... to get America in a position at the federal level I think is fairly consistent with the rest of the world,"" Graham said Tuesday in announcing the legislation.
The legislation includes exceptions for situations involving rape, incest or risks to the life and physical health of the mother.
""If we take back the House and Senate, I can assure you we'll have a vote"" on the bill, Graham..."
"On Tuesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams signed an executive order to reduce fines and penalties for small businesses from a wide range of government agencies. After signing the order, Adams took questions from journalists and spoke about his hope for corporate workers to return to their Manhattan offices in order to stimulate local businesses. 
“Many employees are saying, ’We don’t want to come back into the office… Now, that’s fine, if we weren’t connected,” said Adams. “My low skill workers — my cooks, my dishwashers, my messengers, my..."
"The Biden administration is tightening travel rules to and within the U.S., requiring all in-bound international passengers to test for Covid within 24 hours of departure and extending its mask requirement on all domestic flights and public transportation through March 18.
The changes were announced Thursday as part of a broader plan to bolster the nation’s arsenal of tools in its fight against the virus as the world enters its third year of the pandemic. 
The plan is also the latest move by the Biden administration to stem the spread..."
"Parents admonished the Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) school board at a public meeting on Tuesday for covering up the sexual assault of a ninth-grade grade by a trans student wearing a skirt in the girl's bathroom.
This follows an explosive Daily Wire report about the girl being assaulted by a trans student that identifies as female. Scott Smith, the father of the female student that was assaulted, went viral after he was arrested for confronting the school system's superintendent at the infamous meeting on June 22, 2021 where Critical..."
"Brazil’s JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) told the U.S. government that a ransomware attack on the company that has disrupted meat production in North America and Australia originated from a criminal organization likely based in Russia, the White House said on Tuesday.
JBS is the world’s largest meatpacker and the cyberattack caused its Australian operations to shut down on Monday and has stopped livestock slaughter at its plants in several U.S. states.
The attack follows one last month by a group with ties to Russia on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States,..."
"An individual wearing an Afghan military uniform gunned down a U.S. Army major-general Tuesday—the highest-ranking American casualty since the war began—and injured 14 other coalition troops visiting the Afghan army's officer school, U.S. officials said.
U.S. officials said initial evidence indicated the attacker was an Afghan soldier and not an outside insurgent wearing an Afghan military uniform. Afghan police and soldiers have frequently opened fire on coalition troops, but Tuesday's attack was unprecedented in terms of how high-ranking the casualties were. Pentagon officials said the general was believed to be..."
"When she led President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers in the late 1990s, Janet Yellen confided to her husband, economist George Akerlof, about the challenges she faced navigating Washington’s political storms.
Those storms are about to become Ms. Yellen’s headache again. As President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Treasury secretary, Ms. Yellen is looking at the most political role she has had in nearly three decades of high-profile policy making. Her job will be to formulate and defend Mr. Biden’s policies at a time when the economy is at a crossroads..."
"sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): This is the first debate of 2020 and the last debate before the voting starts in Iowa in less than three weeks. There are six candidates (the smallest debate stage yet), and we’ve finally published our primary forecast (!!!), which shows the field (especially in Iowa) is pretty wide open.
So how are you thinking about tonight’s debate? Do you think it has the potential to really shake things up?
clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): I think the big story on Monday — and..."
"Democrats launched their general-election pitch during the first night of their virtual convention, presenting Joe Biden as someone who could heal a nation battling a coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest while criticizing President Trump’s handling of those upheavals.
Former first lady Michelle Obama, in Monday night’s keynote speech, described Mr. Trump as the “wrong president for our country,” adding that he is “clearly in over his head.”
“If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me they can, and they will, if we don’t make a change in this..."
"The National Institute of Health (NIH) has denied funding studies that would make a coronavirus more dangerous to humans after it was accused of doing so following the release of research proposals.
The documents were obtained and released by The Intercept on Tuesday after it launched an FOIA lawsuit.
Richard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University and laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, told Newsweek these documents show ""unequivocally"" that NIH grants were used to fund controversial gain-of-function (GOF) research at the Wuhan..."
"US President Joe Biden has said government measures to tackle global supply chain issues have averted a pre-Christmas crisis.
He was speaking ahead of a meeting with officials and company bosses, including transportation giant FedEx.
In June, he created a task force to address rising prices and shortages of goods caused by the pandemic.
However, some business owners and industry experts say American firms are still facing supply problems.
""The much-predicted crisis didn't occur,"" Mr Biden said ahead of a meeting with his Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force and corporate..."
"Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) announced Tuesday that he has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination, his strongest indication yet that he will mount a third-party White House bid.
“Today, I launched an exploratory committee to seek the @LPNational’s nomination for president of the United States. Americans are ready for practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people,” Amash tweeted.
“We’re ready for a presidency that will restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together. I’m excited and honored to be taking these..."
"President Trump told a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night that “the time for trivial fights is over” as he sought to reset his presidency after a chaotic first 40 days.
“The time for small thinking is behind us,” Trump said. “We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that still our souls and the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams into action.
“From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations not burdened..."
"U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has chosen David Kessler, the ex-head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to help lead the COVID-19 vaccine push, his transition team said on Friday.
The news came as Biden was due to outline his plans to ramp up vaccinations amid soaring infections and an early rollout by the Trump administration that Biden has called “a dismal failure.”
Kessler, a pediatrician and lawyer who headed the FDA under presidents George Bush senior and Bill Clinton, will be Chief Science Officer of the administration’s COVID-19 Response."
"The House passed a sweeping $1.5 trillion omnibus spending package on Wednesday night to fund the government, hours after lawmakers scrapped billions in funding to combat the COVID-19 pandemic amid resistance from Democrats upset about plans to yank already allocated relief from states.
The last-minute revolt over the COVID-19 funding from Democrats angered over a GOP-demanded offset upended a delicately negotiated package between congressional leaders of both parties.
As part of those bipartisan negotiations, the House passage of the omnibus package, which funds the federal government through September, was split in two votes so..."
"The fate of former national security adviser Michael Flynn lies in the hands of a federal judge with an established reputation of being a fiercely independent thinker.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who was appointed to the bench in 1994 by former President Clinton, will determine whether to grant the request by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to drop charges against Flynn, who pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to federal agents about conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
On Tuesday evening, Sullivan pulled a surprise, announcing..."
"Amy Coney Barrett, a front-runner for the open U.S. Supreme Court seat President Donald Trump is pushing to fill, is a favorite among religious conservatives.
As a judge on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett, 48, has voted in favor of one of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and shown support for expansive gun rights. Here are some of her most notable opinions.

Barrett indicated support for gun rights in a March 2019 dissenting opinion.
She was part of a three-judge panel that considered a challenge..."
"A bill to bolster chip manufacturing and scientific research won Senate approval, setting Congress up to clear a trimmed economic competitiveness package after a more than yearlong push.
The Senate voted 64-33 Wednesday to pass the “chips and science” bill. The House is expected to clear the legislation before leaving town Friday for the August recess, sending it to President Joe Biden for his signature."
"Law enforcement officials say the suspect who tried to breach the Cincinnati FBI field office Thursday is dead after raising his weapon at authorities during a standoff.
Police said in a news conference that they are still investigating the motive of the man, who was identified as 42-year-old Ricky Shiffer. Police said they were investigating whether or not Shiffer had ties to any right-wing extremist groups, according to The Associated Press.
No officers were injured in the standoff with the suspect. Police said they attempted to negotiate with the suspect,..."
"After promising another round of stimulus payments worth $1,400 to many Americans, President Joe Biden has reportedly signaled that he is open to restricting the number of people who would receive them, based on their income.
Democrats are reportedly considering sending the $1,400 payments to individuals earning up to $50,000, and $2,800 to married couples earning up to $100,000 (plus $1,400 per child), according to The Washington Post. That’s a decrease from the first and second round of checks, which started phasing out at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for..."
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and President Trump have struck a deal on a multibillion-dollar stimulus package aimed at assisting millions of Americans directly hurt by the coronavirus outbreak.
Pelosi announced the deal on Friday evening after days of roller-coaster negotiations that put the outcome in doubt, as the nation’s leaders raced to ease public anxiety and stabilize volatile markets. Trump said on Twitter that he looked forward to signing the legislation.
""I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide..."
"U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will decide this week whether to create a special committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, her deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, said on Twitter on Tuesday.
Reuters and other U.S. news outlets, citing sources familiar with the decision, earlier on Tuesday reported that Pelosi had decided to create the committee. 
“Clarification on tonight’s meeting of the Steering and Policy Committee. Speaker Pelosi told Members she plans to announce WHETHER she will create a select committee THIS WEEK. Her..."
"Russia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine during the second phase of what it calls its special military operation, the deputy commander of Russia's central military district said on Friday, Russian news agencies reported.
The statement from Rustam Minnekayev, the deputy commander, is one of the most detailed about Moscow's latest ambitions in Ukraine and suggests Russia does not plan to wind down its offensive there anytime soon.
Minnekayev did not mention them by name, but two major Ukrainian cities in southern Ukraine, Odesa and Mykolayiv,..."
"Vaccine hesitancy is an increasing problem at a time when, with the emergence of the highly contagious delta variant, compliance is more important than ever. As our leaders and public health experts struggle to find the best way to promote compliance, one thing is increasingly clear — condescension or assertion, or a sleeve of numbers thrown at a fearful patient, are not techniques that are working. 
The term “misinformation” has been thrown around a lot lately by the Biden administration, and many from the president himself lashing out at Facebook..."
"President Biden ordered a U.S. intelligence inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, following renewed scrutiny on the possibility that the outbreak of the virus might have started with a laboratory leak in China.
The White House has come under pressure to carry out its own investigation after China told the World Health Organization that it considered Beijing’s part of the investigation complete, calling for efforts to trace the virus’s origins to shift into other countries.
Mr. Biden, who wants a report within 90 days, said that U.S. intelligence has focused on two scenarios—whether..."
"“It is unclear from the data if partisans are reacting to the developments in their own party's nomination race, the other party's nomination race or both. Republicans' increasingly dour sentiments may be related to Trump -- either the increasing inevitability that he will gain his party's nomination, or the way controversial aspects of his campaign have dominated the news. Trump is the least popular Republican nominee among members of his own party in recent elections going back to 1996, and he is much less well-liked than Hillary Clinton is among..."
"With the removal of the federal mask mandate on public transportation, whether and when to mask has become largely a personal choice. 
Changes in the trajectory and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and shifts in messaging from authorities can make the decision harder.
Although much of the U.S. no longer requires people to wear masks in indoor public settings, there are still scenarios where wearing a mask could be beneficial, public-health and infectious-disease experts say. Factors that help determine whether you should consider masking include local Covid-19 levels, where you are going and your underlying health conditions, as well..."
"For the past 15 years, violence has been on the rise in Mexico due to the growth of organized crime, turf wars, and high rates of impunity. But the Mexican government in August acted to curb another potential factor in the country’s high death toll: It filed suit against a handful of U.S.-based gun manufacturers for their role in the steady flow of arms that cross the border into Mexico each year.
What’s the lawsuit about?
The Mexican government filed a lawsuit on Aug. 4 in Massachusetts federal court against..."
"Conservative MP Sir David Amess has died after being stabbed multiple times at his constituency surgery in Essex.
Police said a 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after the attack at a church in Leigh-on-Sea.
They recovered a knife and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. A counter terrorism team will lead the investigation.

"The last of the first-quarter campaign finance reports were made public Monday, providing the most complete picture of who's ahead and who's behind in the presidential money race among declared candidates.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) leads the pack on the Democratic side with a massive $18.2 million haul. But even that sum pales in comparison to the $30 million President Trump brought in from January through March.
And while it’s still early in the election cycle — the Iowa caucuses are almost 10 months away — the fundraising numbers are..."
"Attorneys in the trial of the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd will make their final case to the jury on Monday, as the Twin Cities region prepares for the possibility of widespread unrest following a verdict in the case.
Closing arguments in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin come after nearly three weeks of testimony in which prosecutors have attempted to prove that the former police officer acted recklessly when he knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than 9 minutes, killing him. The defense has..."
"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Wednesday emphasized a diverse American judicial branch in order to ""bolster public confidence in our system.""
Why it matters: If confirmed, Jackson would become the first Black woman to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
Jackson has been open about her belief that she stands ""on the shoulders of so many who have come before me,"" and has also acknowledged countless times the historic nature of her nomination.
Jackson said on Tuesday that she believes public confidence in the court is ""crucial,"" adding that it is ""the..."
"U.S. lawmakers urged Alphabet Inc's leading Google search engine to give accurate results to people seeking abortions rather than sometimes sending them to ""crisis pregnancy centers,"" which steer woman away from the procedures.
The request came in a letter, whose top signatories were Senator Mark Warner and Representative Elissa Slotkin, sent to Google on Friday and first reported by Reuters.
The letter was prompted by a study released last week by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate. The study found that 11% of the results for a search for an..."
"In a much-anticipated decision, the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected another effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law often regarded as the signature legislative achievement of former President Barack Obama. The justices did not reach the main issue in the case: whether the entirety of the ACA was rendered unconstitutional when Congress eliminated the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance. Instead, by a vote of 7-2, the justices ruled that neither the states nor the individuals challenging the mandate have a legal right to sue, known..."
"Top officials responsible for the security of the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack are scheduled to testify before Congress Tuesday about the failure to adequately prepare for and counter a deadly riot on the day lawmakers convened to certify the results of the presidential election.
A joint bipartisan committee of senators will question three security officials who resigned in the wake of the attack: former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, former House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving and former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger. Robert..."
"President Joe Biden signed an executive order Friday that attempts to bolster women’s access to contraception and abortion medication and protect their medical privacy two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion.
But the president’s order does not restore abortion rights in the states that have banned the procedure — or soon will. Nor does it appear to affect Florida’s 15-week abortion ban, which took effect July 1.
Biden, acting as pressure mounts from Democrats and abortion rights advocates, directed the U.S. Department of..."
"A federal grand jury on Friday indicted former Trump adviser Steven Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress for his failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Jan. 6 select committee.
Why it matters: It's the first such indictment to come out of the committee's investigation of the Capitol insurrection — and the first time the Justice Department has charged someone for contempt of Congress since 1983.
Bannon faces fines and possible jail time. Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year..."
"A CNN debate moderator is coming under criticism for asking Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) what she thought when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) reportedly told her that a woman could not win the presidential election, seconds after Sanders flatly denied he ever told Warren such a thing.
The different accounts from Sanders and Warren of the conversation at their December 2018 meeting was a highlight of Tuesday night’s debate.
CNN moderator Abby Phillip raised the issue about an hour into the two-hour debate, asking Sanders about CNN’s report of the conversation...."
"A Texas law that would bar social media companies from taking action on hate speech and disinformation was temporarily blocked Tuesday in a rare 5-4 Supreme Court ruling. 
Justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer ruled in favor of tech industry groups looking to block the law, with Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan dissenting. 
The decision is a win for tech groups pushing back on laws coming from Republican-controlled state legislatures that seek to put barriers on social media companies’ ability to moderate content. 
A case on the law itself may wind up..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for a New York grand jury to obtain former President Donald Trump’s financial records. Over four months after Trump asked them to intervene, the justices turned down a request by the former president to stay a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that permits Cyrus Vance, the district attorney for Manhattan, to enforce a subpoena to Mazars USA, the president’s longtime accountant. Monday’s order means that Vance and the grand jury likely will finally acquire eight years..."
"U.S. Attorney General William Barr has no plans to appoint special counsels to investigate President-elect Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, or to investigate President Donald Trump’s unfounded claims of election fraud, he said on Monday.
Speaking to reporters two days before he plans to step down from his position as the nation’s top law enforcement official, Barr once again distanced himself from Trump’s claims, contrary to evidence, that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Barr, one of Trump’s staunchest supporters, said he saw “no basis” for the..."
"It turns out he wasn’t in “goblin mode” after all. Last week Elon Musk, in his characteristically antic manner, tweeted a series of suggestions for improving Twitter after he was revealed to have become its largest individual shareholder. They ranged from asking if the site’s HQ should be turned into a homeless shelter to whether advertising should be removed from the platform’s premium service.
Many of these tweets were subsequently deleted, including one sharing a meme depicting the attorney Saul Goodman from the series Breaking Bad with the words: “In all..."
"More than 130 Secret Service officers are quarantining due to positive coronavirus tests or exposure to a co-worker who has tested positive, the Washington Post reports.
Why it matters: Officials told the Post that they believe the cases at least partly stem from President Trump's run of campaign rallies before Election Day. The number of officers forced off-duty — roughly 10% of its core security team — could stress the Secret Service at large, forcing overtime and missed days off to make up for the strain.
""Being down more than..."
"I haven’t seen President Trump’s tax returns. I’m going to start there. No matter how many times I’ve been asked today to offer my “take” on the returns, I can’t give a more honest answer than, “I haven’t seen the returns.”
I have, however, read the very detailed article from the New York Times NYT +0.2%, which can be found here. I’m not inclined to summarize it for you - you can read it on your own - and I’m not going to do an op-ed on the piece. If..."
"U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in September, while the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, pointing to a tight labor market which keeps the Federal Reserve on its aggressive monetary policy tightening campaign for a while.
Though the 0.2 point decline in the jobless rate from 3.7% in August was partly because of people leaving the workforce, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed fewer Americans working part-time for economic reasons last month. The labor market continues to show resilience despite the Fed's stiff interest..."
"Former President Obama's attorneys say they plan to file a cease-and-desist letter over a pro-Trump group's television ad in South Carolina that attacks former Vice President Joe Biden by using a portion of Obama's book out of context.
Obama is also demanding that all South Carolina television stations immediately stop running the ad from the Committee to Defend the President, which is aimed at supporting President Trump's reelection bid.
""This despicable ad is straight out of the Republican disinformation playbook, and it’s clearly designed to suppress turnout among minority voters..."
"Last week, KFOR, a local news outlet in Oklahoma, published a story that contained some terrifying information: so many people in the state were hospitalized due to overdoses of ivermectin—a drug originally designed for horses, which some anti-vaccine sources have promoted (incorrectly) as a defense against COVID-19—that there was no room in intensive-care units for other patients, including those with gunshot wounds. The story contained quotes from an interview with Dr. Jason McElyea, a local physician, and was quickly picked up by a number of national outlets, including Rolling Stone magazine, the Guardian, Newsweek magazine, and Business Insider. A producer for..."
"“We absolutely stand by the president’s comment.” With those words, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield reaffirmed that President Biden maintains his son Hunter Biden did “nothing [that] was unethical” and never “made money” in China.
Those claims appear demonstrably false — and they make the positions of both the media and Attorney General Merrick Garland absolutely untenable.
For the media, the ongoing investigation of Hunter Biden by U.S. Attorney David Weiss in Delaware has presented a growing danger of self-indictment over its prior coverage (or noncoverage). Weiss has called a long line of witnesses before a..."
"It’s the end of a bullish era for the stock market and the beginning of a new phase of bearishness, after a sharp plunge for risk assets on Wednesday pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average into bear-market territory for the first time in more than a decade.
U.S. equity indexes on Wednesday mostly resumed a downtrend that saw all three major U.S. equity gauges touch bear-market territory, commonly defined as a decline of at least 20% from a recent peak. The declines deepened after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19,..."
"Futures contracts tied to the major U.S. stock indexes were higher on Wednesday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended its historic 11-year bull market run by closing in a bear market.

"Joe Biden's recent job approval ratings, which are averaging 14 points lower than those early in his presidency, have declined far more among younger than older generations of Americans. In fact, Biden's job approval has changed relatively little among baby boomers and not at all among traditionalists. As a result, older Americans are now more likely to approve of the president than younger Americans are.
This analysis is based on aggregated Gallup poll data since Biden became president, dividing his presidency into three distinct periods defined by his average approval..."
"U.S. stocks fell sharply again on Wednesday as investors grappled with a flood of plans by governments to limit the economic blow of the COVID-19 outbreak and debated whether the measures will be enough to limit the economic blow.
The S&P 500 index tumbled about 6.3%, while Treasuries looked to extend their biggest yield jump since 2008 on Tuesday as markets braced for a flood of government borrowing. Crude oil prices dropped to an 18-year low and the U.S. dollar rose for a seventh straight day."
"Stocks, bonds and commodities fell Wednesday in a simultaneous selloff that suggests investors are seeking to raise cash quickly to cope with the economic disruption sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,420 points, or 6.7%, to 19818 in midday trading. The S&P 500 dropped 5.8% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 4.6%. All three indexes are down about 30% from their mid-February highs.
Oil, meanwhile, plunged 15% to its lowest level in more than 18 years."
"US President Joe Biden and the leaders of three major Asia-Pacific countries, an alliance known as the “Quad”, discussed “aggression” and “coercion” against members of the group by China, while agreeing to cooperate on development of 5G and other advanced technologies, in their first summit meeting on Friday.
Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, meeting by means of large flat-screen televisions, discussed China’s “coercion of Australia, their harassment around the Senkaku Islands, their aggression on the border with..."
"Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is more than 100 days old, and despite providing enough U.S. military aid during that time to nearly double Kyiv’s defense budget, the Biden administration remains concerned about provoking Russia into a wider war, a stance that has frustrated many in Washington and Eastern Europe. 
Even after U.S. President Joe Biden signed off on providing the long-range High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to Ukraine last week, the U.S. administration faced criticism from NATO allies and Capitol Hill that the aid was too little, too..."
"President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a cease-fire on trade that will remove some curbs on Huawei Technologies Co. buying high-tech equipment from the U.S., for the moment lifting one cloud over the global economy.
Under the cease-fire, the U.S. agreed to put off additional tariffs on Chinese goods indefinitely. In response, China will start buying large amounts of American farm products, Mr. Trump said."
"President Trump and his family took off on Air Force One at 9 a.m. on Wednesday morning for the final time en route to Florida.
The big picture: Trump's final hours as president were punctuated by his decisions to snub his successor's inauguration and grant pardons to many of his allies who have been swept up in corruption scandals.
Simultaneously, congressional leaders were en route to attend Catholic mass with Joe Biden, hours before he is sworn is as the 46th president of the United States.

"The Supreme Court has spoken: Abortion is no longer a constitutional right. This permits states to be the ultimate arbiter of abortion, creating a red and blue collage of abortion access across the nation. 
Putting aside for the moment the moral, ethical and religious debates surrounding abortion, what does the data say that can help guide us as we move forward from this decision? Like all laws and policies, there are certain to be unintended consequences. 
Trends: The number of reported legal abortions in the United States peaked in 1990 at around 1.6..."
"Donald Trump’s defense lawyers will make their case on Friday why the former president is not guilty of inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, as the Senate races toward a final vote in his impeachment trial as soon as Saturday.
Trump’s lawyer David Schoen said the defense team would take “three to four hours” on Friday to lay out its arguments against convicting Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot, which sent lawmakers scrambling for safety and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police..."
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Saturday rejected a last-ditch bid from Republicans including Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) to halt the certification of the 2020 election results in the Keystone State.
The court's decision delivered the latest blow for Republicans, President Trump and his campaign to overturn election results in a battleground state that President-elect Joe Biden won by over 1 percentage point.
In an order released on Saturday night, the state supreme court vacated a preliminary order by the Commonwealth Court and dismissed the case."
"As Election Day nears and political analysis firm Cook Political Report noted momentum toward Republican Senate control, Pennsylvania weighs heavy on voters’ minds. 
In the gubernatorial race, Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro seems to be in as good of a position as any, with polls having him leading Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano by double digits. However, once seemingly Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s (D) for the taking, the open U.S. Senate seat is now anyone’s game.
Since Pennsylvania’s midterm election results could decide whether Democrats take a more secure control of the..."
"Kyle Rittenhouse's mother appealed for donors on behalf of a defense fund set up to help pay her son's legal costs as the jury continues deliberations in his case, CNN reported.
Wendy Rittenhouse made the appeal in an email and estimated that Kyle Rittenhouse's legal costs for the month of November will amount to $110,000, according to CNN.
She called the court battle ""an extremely uphill battle from the beginning"" and said that her son's team could put up a ""big fight"" because of the support of ""thousands of our fellow Americans,"" per CNN.

"Two white policemen who fired into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker, will not be prosecuted for her death because their use of force was justified, but a third was charged with endangering her neighbors, Kentucky’s attorney general said on Wednesday. Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced the Louisville grand jury’s decision at a news conference as protesters against racial injustice and police brutality massed in the streets of Kentucky’s largest city.
Former Detective Brett Hankison was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree,..."
"A scientist known for investigating viral origins has reconstructed the first known weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, adding to a growing body of evidence that the virus behind it jumped from infected animals to humans rather than emerging from laboratory research.
In a paper published Thursday in the academic journal Science, Michael Worobey concludes a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, China, where live mammals were sold is very likely to be the site of the origin of the pandemic.
The precise role of the Huanan market in the pandemic has been debated by scientists...."
"President Biden officially announced on Wednesday that his administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually and $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients, marking the largest forgiveness of federal student loans per individual to date.
Biden also again extended a payment freeze on federal student loans and interest accrual, butting right up against an Aug. 31 deadline that would have kicked bills back into effect just before November’s midterm elections."
"It’s time for the third Democratic debate! And a lot has changed since the first debate in June. Back then, there was only one clear polling front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, and the size of the field was daunting, with more than 20 “major” candidates. Now, though, the field has winnowed a bit, and the polls show three to five candidates vying for the lead. Biden is still out in front, but he’s now followed more closely by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, with Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg..."
"President Barack Obama implored world leaders to unite against a series of international crises—from the rise of militant group Islamic State, which he called ""a network of death,"" to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and Russia's intervention in Ukraine.
Mr. Obama, in his annual address to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, cited ""the cancer of violent extremism"" in the Middle East as the single issue that could derail future global progress, and said six years into his presidency that the world is at a crossroads. He specifically..."
"On Friday, seven candidates faced off in a Manchester, New Hampshire, debate hosted by ABC News. (Note: ABC News owns FiveThirtyEight.) This could be voters’ last look at the candidates before the state casts its votes for a Democratic nominee on Tuesday, and we once again partnered with Ipsos to track how the debate affected likely primary voters’ feelings about the candidates on the stage. The FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll, conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, interviews the same group of voters twice, once on either side of the debate, to capture both the..."
"Twitter’s former head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko has accused his former employer of cybersecurity negligence in an explosive whistleblower complaint first obtained by CNN and The Washington Post.
Zatko, a well-known hacker, was recruited by Twitter to head up the company’s security division in late-2020, months after a very public breach saw hackers hijack the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including Joe Biden and Elon Musk. He was let go from the company less than two years later.
Though his time at Twitter was brief, Zatko says he witnessed “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful..."
"Jobless claims rose for the second straight week, to 778,000, a sign the nationwide surge in virus cases was starting to weigh on the labor-market recovery.
Worker filings for unemployment insurance are down sharply from a peak of nearly seven million in late March. But they remain higher than in any previous recession—the pre-pandemic peak was 695,000 in 1982—for records tracing back to 1967.
Claims filings can be more volatile around the holidays, due to workweek changes that can cause seasonal-adjustment anomalies. The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly..."
"Within hours of President Trump’s announcement Saturday that his administration would provide pandemic-related relief to millions of Americans, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle assailed the move as yet another instance of presidential overreach. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) — who don’t agree on much — settled on the same phrase to describe the president’s actions: “unconstitutional slop.”
That’s understandable — but wrong. Trump has so often exceeded normal limits on presidential authority that it is easy to assume unlawfulness on his part. But..."
"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol took the remarkable step Thursday of voting to subpoena former President Trump during what could be its final public hearing.
The televised vote comes after the panel wavered for months on whether it would subpoena the bombastic former president, who has frequently criticized the investigation as a partisan witch hunt designed to hurt him politically."
"Gasoline prices continue to tumble throughout the U.S., taking the starch out of the stiff rise in inflation and cheering up consumers.
Why it matters: Average national gasoline prices hit $5.02 a gallon back in June, amplifying the national fixation on inflation.
Driving the news: According to AAA, a gallon of regular was an average of $3.74 on Friday, more than 25% lower than the June peak.
Yes, but: Not everyone's experience at the pump will mirror the national average.

"If confirmed as its first Black woman justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson would add not only racial and gender diversity to the U.S. Supreme Court but would also bring a varied legal background including a stint representing low-income criminal defendants.
Jackson, 51, served early in her career as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose retirement announced in January created a vacancy on the nation's top judicial body that President Joe Biden picked her to fill. Biden, a Democrat, last year appointed Jackson to an influential Washington-based appellate court..."
"First lady Melania Trump expressed frustration that she received criticism for the Trump administration's 2018 border separation policy, according to secret recordings released by CNN on Thursday.
The first lady’s former friend and senior adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff secretly recorded the first lady after she left the White House, according to CNN.
""They say I'm complicit. I'm the same like him, I support him. I don't say enough I don't do enough where I am,"" Melania Trump said."
"At least 76 protesters have been killed by Iranian security forces during 11 days of unrest sparked by the death of a woman in custody, activists say.
Iran Human Rights (IHR), a Norway-based organisation, accused authorities of using disproportionate force and live ammunition to suppress the dissent.
State media have put the number of dead at 41, including several security personnel, and blamed ""rioters"".
Hundreds of people have also been arrested, 20 of them journalists.

"The DNA of Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles was found at the crime scene after Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German was fatally stabbed, police announced on Thursday.
Las Vegas police also said they found evidence at Telles’ home, including shoes and pieces of a straw hat, that tied him to the killing.
“This is a terrible and jarring homicide — one that has deeply impacted Las Vegas,” Sheriff Joe Lombardo said at a morning news conference. “Every murder is tragic, but the killing of a journalist is particularly..."
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday demanded that the Federal Reserve cut rates even more after the central bank announced it would slash rates by 50 basis points in an effort to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Fed “must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors,” Trump tweeted.
“We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!”"
"The first head-to-head debate of the Democratic presidential primary between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders focused on the government’s response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. We sorted through competing claims the two front-runners made about the pandemic, as well as other topics including Social Security, super PACs and bailouts.
After Biden claimed the House had just passed a coronavirus relief bill that said “you do not have to pay for any of this, period,” Sanders responded by saying the legislation had an “enormous” loophole. The bill..."
"Democrats in the U.S. Congress aim to pass bills protecting same-sex marriage, clarifying lawmakers' role in certifying presidential elections and raising the nation's debt ceiling when they return from the campaign trail on Monday.
President Joe Biden's party got a boost over the weekend when it learned it would keep control of the Senate for the next two years, while control of the House of Representatives is still up in the air as votes are counted after Tuesday's midterm election.
But Democrats escaped a feared midterm drubbing and will look..."
"President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he discussed Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son in a call with Ukraine’s president.
Trump’s statement to reporters about his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came as the Democratic leader of a key congressional panel said the pursuit of Trump’s impeachment may be the “only remedy” to the situation.
Trump’s call with Zelensky has been at the center of an escalating battle in Washington since Friday, when news outlets reported that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader to..."
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president, a senior State Department official said Monday, a disclosure that ties the State Department more closely to the House impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Pompeo’s participation on the call, which hadn’t been previously reported, was one of several developments related to the controversy that centers on Mr. Trump’s repeated urging that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cooperate with Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, and Attorney General William..."
"By now, we all know what Fox News’ Tucker Carlson is.
He is a divider whose goal is to stir up his audience with dangerous rhetoric about race and other extreme right talking points. He spends most of his show stirring the pot then later uses his well-practiced tactics to deny he said what we all know he meant. Or that those rightfully bothered by what he said are blowing it all out of proportion.
“Whaaat did I say? No, no, you misunderstood me. The left is trying to cancel..."
"A New York judge tossed a state criminal case against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, saying the indictment violated a law that protects defendants from being prosecuted for the same crimes twice.
Mr. Manafort, 70 years old, is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after his federal convictions on bank and tax fraud, among other crimes. Mr. Manafort didn’t appear in court Wednesday due to health issues, the judge said.
The state indictment, brought by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, had accused the former Trump campaign chairman of submitting..."
"The results in Nevada will likely have a meaningful effect on the overall race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Coming into Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders is a strong favorite to win Nevada — FiveThirtyEight’s forecast gives him about a 6 in 7 chance of finishing first there. But how much he wins by — or whether he wins at all — will also affect what the race looks like coming out of the Silver State. Although Sanders is favored, there’s still a chance that someone else wins Nevada — not..."
"Ashton Carter, the former deputy defense secretary, is the leading candidate to become the next Pentagon chief, but senior officials said President Barack Obama wouldn’t make an announcement Tuesday.
The president could announce his pick for defense secretary later this week, a senior White House official said. Mr. Carter, who was out of town Tuesday, is seen as the likely choice, officials said.
But the White House is continuing to look at other candidates, including former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig and former assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell."
"President Biden on Thursday will meet with House Democrats to outline the specifics of his economic agenda and push for its passage along with a bipartisan infrastructure deal after months of negotiations.
Biden plans to announce a new framework that is expected to win approval from all Democrats on the Hill, according to a White House source, though it remains to be seen if progressives will get on board with a pared-down version of the proposal.
The president will return to the White House after the meeting at the Capitol and deliver remarks on his agenda..."
"Democratic campaign organizations have been spending millions on ads for Republicans whom they call “extreme,” or “fringe,” hoping if those “extremes” win their primaries, they’ll be easier to beat in November.
It’s a strategy drawing criticism from many Republicans, Independents and even from many other Democrats, who argue it’s not just wrong, but that it’s hypocritical to call someone a threat to democracy and then possibly help them get elected.
“John Gibbs is too conservative for west Michigan,” a political ad on YouTube reads out.
The ad meant to oppose Republican John Gibbs was posted and paid for by..."
"The only words we can say to veterans are ""thank you"", Theresa May has told a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy invasion.
Her words were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who told D-Day veterans gathered in northern France that we owe them ""our freedom"".
The day of commemorative events began with a lone piper marking the moment the first UK soldiers went ashore.
Donald Trump later told US veterans they were ""the pride of the nation"".
The US president was at a service at the..."
"President Trump on Tuesday granted clemency to three former Republican congressmen as well as two individuals charged as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, George Papadopoulos and Alex van der Zwaan.
Trump granted a full pardon to former California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, who pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds in 2019. He also granted a pardon to former New York GOP Rep.

"Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) on Friday called for new Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill after top House Democrats scrapped plans to vote on legislation banning lawmaker stock trading.
The scathing statement from Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman in a tight reelection race, came one day after House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said a bill prohibiting lawmakers from trading stocks would not be put up for a vote this week."
"The $10 million Paycheck Protection Program loan that Shake Shack is giving back cannot be used by the government to fund new loans to small businesses because of the way the program was structured.
The $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program ran out of funds last week, locking out small businesses that were unable to secure access to the emergency lending program that is being run by the federal government’s Small Business Administration."
"Shake Shack Inc.’s top executives are calling for improvements to the tangled process of applying for a loan from the Paycheck Protection Program that is meant to provide a lifeline to restaurants hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The PPP is part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act.
The burger chain SHAK, +5.26% announced early Monday that it is returning the $10 million loan it was granted after it secured funding on Friday. The company decided to apply for the loan in the first place after trying to make sense..."
"The trucker protests at the Port of Oakland have stopped the flow of trade for at least two days and some vessels are now either pulling up anchor to go to another port or skipping the port. In an effort to restore production, the port has established “Free Speech Zones” which were described in an open letter to the trucking community last night.
Truckers have been protesting since Monday against the California gig labor law. That law classifies workers as employees rather than independent contractors. Truckers who are classified as independent owner and..."

The milestone comes one..."
"A New York judge ruled on Thursday that former U.S. President Donald Trump and two of his adult children must answer questions under oath in the state attorney general's civil probe into their family company's business.
Justice Arthur Engoron of New York state court in Manhattan ruled in favor of Attorney General Letitia James, who sought to enforce subpoenas to compel testimony by Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and his daughter Ivanka Trump.
Engoron said James had ""the clear right"" to question the Trumps after having uncovered ""copious evidence..."
"President Biden said he stands “squarely behind” his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, speaking from the White House Monday as he drew bipartisan criticism over the swift collapse of the government and the ensuing chaos.
He acknowledged that the Taliban takeover of the country happened more quickly than he expected and that the exit has been “far from perfect,” although he took little responsibility for that. He called the images of desperate Afghans at Kabul’s international airport trying to flee their country gut-wrenching.
While pledging to get Americans and U.S. allies out..."
"More than 30 million families are at risk of losing their child tax credit benefits this weekend after Congrees failed to pass an extension of the safety net program that benefited children during the pandemic. 
The Biden administration initially expanded the credit in 2021 after removing the work requirement and saw the CTC reach $93 billion to 36 million families over a span of six month. The CTC gave a $300 tax credit for every child 5-years-old or younger and a $250 tax credit for every child between the ages..."
"More than a quarter-million Americans have died from complications of COVID-19, the disease caused by a coronavirus that is tearing massive holes in states across the nation, as health experts warn the death toll could double in the coming months.
NBC News reported the death toll crossed the 250,000 mark on Wednesday. Other counts maintained by Johns Hopkins University and The New York Times were slightly below that figure.
The United States continues to be the epicenter of the pandemic, accounting for a hugely disproportionate share of cases and..."
"Consumer confidence hit a 10-year low in November as inflation climbed to the highest levels since the early 1990s, complicating efforts from policymakers to sell the case that the current surge of price increases is temporary.
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index tumbled to 66.8 for November, according to a preliminary reading Friday. That was the lowest since November 2011 and well below the Dow Jones estimate of 72.5. October’s reading was 71.7, meaning that the November level represented a 6.8% drop.
The survey showed consumers expecting still-higher rates of inflation,..."
"Moderna on Thursday submitted a request to the FDA for emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to under 6 years of age.
Why it matters: Young children have been largely unprotected throughout the pandemic. The FDA's approval could ultimately permit them to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
The big picture: Moderna said last month its COVID-19 vaccine for children — which consists of two 25-microgram doses — generated a strong immune response in children ages 6 months to 5 years.
Efficacy was 43.7% for children ages 6 months to 2..."
"President Joe Biden drew a biting rebuke on Twitter and Fox News after saying that record-high gas prices are part of an ""incredible transition"" away from fossil fuels.
Biden made the comment during a press conference Monday in Tokyo, Japan, as part of a diplomatic trip to Asia. The president's foes quickly pounced on the comment as proof that Biden's clean-energy policies were woefully out of touch and harming the American public with heightened gas prices.
Appearing at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Biden was asked by a reporter if Americans should..."
"Senate Republicans are keeping their distance from a House-passed bill to protect same-sex marriage, even though polls show a majority of Republicans support it and the measure passed overwhelmingly in the lower chamber with 47 House GOP votes.
So far only three Senate Republicans say they will support the measure and a fourth, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), says she supports marriage equality generally but needs to look at the legislation more closely.  
“I have long made known public my support for marriage equality,” she said, explaining that she hasn’t had a..."
"The White House has excluded CNN anchors from attending a private annual lunch it hosts on the day of the State of the Union, according to three unnamed sources in a network report.
Trump has often had a contentious relationship with the media and CNN in particular.
In the past, the president has referred to CNN as ""fake news,"" and some of his rally attendees have chanted ""CNN sucks"" when Trump broaches the subject of the media."
"Russia fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands found refuge far from Ukraine's battlefields, as Moscow tries to regain the initiative in its stalled campaign against Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden was due to talk with Chinese president Xi Jinping later on Friday, in an attempt to starve Russia's war machine by isolating Moscow from the one big power that has yet to condemn its assault.
More than three weeks since President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion to subdue what he calls..."
"The surge in new COVID-19 infections is driving a fresh wave of restrictions in cities and counties across the United States.
California’s “emergency brake,” Oregon’s “freeze,” Philadelphia’s “safer at home” and Minnesota’s “dial back” are among a new patchwork of rules adopted by states, cities and counties that are much less strict and far more narrow than measures imposed to stop the spread of the virus in the spring.
The overall economic bite will be smaller, too, compared to the downdraft that started earlier this year and which led to..."
"Hillary Clinton used the first public rally of her presidential campaign to align herself with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, saying she wanted to ease income inequality and would push for expanded paid family leave, universal preschool and other liberal priorities.

The White House distributed a document..."
"Most of New York’s updated concealed carry policy took effect Thursday banning concealed weapons in many public spaces and adding new requirements for people seeking firearm licenses, after the Supreme Court struck down the state’s previous law , though the new legislation could still face legal challenges.
New York enacted the Concealed Carry Improvement Act in July after the Supreme Court struck down the state’s previous concealed carry law for being overly broad.
The new law imposes more specific requirements for concealed carry licenses, including undergoing training, providing character references..."
"Russia has hit Ukraine with a wave of attacks, dive-bombing the capital, Kyiv, with what appear to be Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drones.
Air strikes hit critical infrastructure in three regions, cutting off electricity in hundreds of villages across the country, according to Prime Minister Denys Shmygal.
At least eight people were killed, four in Sumy and four in Kyiv.
Calls have mounted for sanctions on Iran, which denies supplying drones.

"A man is in custody after several pipe bomb-like devices were discovered along a Labor Day parade route in New Jersey that Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and first lady Tammy Murphy were scheduled to attend, NJ.com reported,
A suspect was reportedly detained on Monday after police found “over half a dozen” devices on his property that was near the town of South Plainfield’s parade route, leading officials to abruptly cancel the festivities.

"President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will compete for the attention of millions of Americans on Thursday night in dueling televised town halls, with Trump’s representing one of his few remaining opportunities to make his case to voters ahead of Election Day.
The competing town halls will be held in lieu of the second presidential debate, which was scrapped last week after Trump objected to plans — put in place over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and the president’s personal battle with COVID-19 — to hold the event..."
"The second presidential debate may be canceled, but there will still be plenty of political fireworks on Thursday night.
Republican President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, will participate in dueling town halls that are airing on rival news networks at the exact same time.
Biden will participate in a 90-minute Philadelphia town hall moderated by ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos, which has been scheduled since last week.
But NBC dropped a bombshell on Wednesday, announcing that Trump will also field questions from voters..."
"On Sunday, a New York Times exposé on President Trump’s tax returns revealed decades of tax avoidance and millions of dollars in business losses over the past two decades. The picture painted by Trump’s returns is sharply at odds with the shrewd, deal-making image the president has tried to fashion as a real estate mogul and TV star on a show built around his business prowess, “The Apprentice.” Now, five weeks from Election Day, the question is will these new revelations affect the presidential race?
There are really two parts..."
"Republicans say they hope a meeting Monday of senators of both parties will avert a clash this week over President Barack Obama's executive-branch nominees that is threatening to poison relations in the Senate and slow progress on a range of legislation.
But the Senate's Democratic leader, Sen. Harry Reid, gave no signal Sunday that he expected anything from the Monday meeting to dissuade him and other Democrats from moving forward on a plan to change Senate rules on nominations. ""We're going to make a simple change,"" Mr. Reid said.
Republicans..."
"Democrat Jon Ossoff beat Republican David Perdue in one of Georgia’s two Senate runoffs, NBC News projected Wednesday, sealing his party’s control of Congress and the White House.
The projection in the race came as rioters backing President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building after he urged supporters at a rally to march to Congress. The attack on the legislature delayed the formal Electoral College count — which dozens of Republicans challenged at Trump’s insistence — as lawmakers evacuated the building.
Democrat Raphael Warnock is projected to defeat GOP Sen...."
"June’s awful US inflation numbers are a reminder of tough days ahead for many in America and around the world, and especially the most vulnerable segments of the population and the most fragile developing countries.
This is not because inflation will record yet another four-decade high over the next three months. It won’t. Rather, it is because of the damage already unleashed and that which is to come.
At 9.1 per cent for June, the headline number for US CPI inflation came in well above the median forecast of 8.8..."
"Tens of thousands of tech workers have been laid off within days, as tech giants including Meta, Twitter, Salesforce and others shed headcount going into the final stretch of the year. At least 20,300 U.S. tech workers were let go from their jobs in November, and more than 100,000 since the beginning of the year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs in the field.
Tech workers reported huge drops in confidence in their job security through the summer, as news of layoffs, hiring freezes and rescinded offers put a damper on what’s so far been a..."
"A night of deadly violence Saturday in Portland had America's two presidential candidates speaking out Sunday afternoon. And their remarks were about as different as their national conventions over the last two weeks.
The fact that there was another night of protests for Black Lives Matter (BLM) and for social justice in Portland isn't anything new, as Saturday marked the 94th-consecutive day since they began in late May. Saturday turned deadly as a group of Donald Trump supporters clashed in the streets with BLM supporters. One man was shot dead..."
"Two of the biggest names in the Democratic Party have split over one of the most vexing issues facing President Biden.
Vice President Harris, on her first international trip since taking office, issued a stark warning to would-be migrants from Guatemala on Monday. “Do not come, do not come,” she said at a news conference. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) swiftly branded Harris’s comments “disappointing” and pointed out that seeking asylum at the U.S. border is “a 100% legal method of arrival.”
The congresswoman from New York went on to link migration to past..."
"Two years after statues of Christopher Columbus were caught up in protests following the killing of George Floyd, some cities are still vexed about what to do with them, as interest groups continue to fight about whether the explorer should be celebrated or sidelined.
In Pittsburgh, a 13-foot-tall likeness of the Genoa-born explorer has been wrapped in plastic while a court battle plays out. Chicago’s mayor has yet to decide what to do with two Columbus statues the city removed in 2020. Meanwhile, a statue of Columbus sculpted this past spring to replace one that..."
"The U.S. Census Bureau will release data on Thursday from the 2020 census that states will use to draw congressional and state legislative districts for the next decade, marking the start of what will be a fierce partisan battle over redistricting.
Demographers also expect the data to show that the country's white population is declining for the first time in history, with people of color representing virtually all population growth.
The release will arrive months later than originally expected after the census took longer to complete due to the coronavirus..."
"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday the alliance is likely to bolster troops along its eastern flank, deploying four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia.
“I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains, with major increases in the eastern part of the alliance on land, in the air and at sea,” Stoltenberg said during a press conference ahead of the NATO leaders summit in Brussels.
Since the Kremlin’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, NATO has readied 140,000 troops in the region and mobilized a..."
"A family previously involved in a showdown with the federal government has occupied a building at a national wildlife refuge in Oregon and is asking militia members to join them.
Ammon Bundy—the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a standoff with the government over grazing rights—told The Oregonian on Saturday that he and two of his brothers were among a group of dozens of people occupying the headquarters of the Malheur National Wil"
"The son of Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia, accused his father of ""lying"" and ""making a mockery"" of his family after a report alleged Walker had paid for his then-girlfriend to have an abortion in 2009.
Why it matters: The abortion allegations and stunning series of tweets from Christian Walker, a 23-year-old conservative TikTok influencer, could hurt Republicans' chances of winning in Georgia — one of the most important Senate battlegrounds in the country.
Christian Walker introduced his father at one of the candidate's earliest fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of..."
"DETROIT — General Motors and union leaders have reached a tentative deal on a new labor contract that could end the United Auto Workers’ monthlong strike against the automaker, the UAW said Wednesday.
Details of the proposed deal were not immediately available. However, the union’s roughly 48,000 members with GM are expected to receive raises and bonuses as part of the accord."

"Hillary Clinton’s email problems are taking a bite out of her approval ratings, raising the GOP’s confidence that she can be defeated in 2016.
A new poll released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University found Clinton trailing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the Sunshine State and enjoying only a 2 percentage point lead over Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).
In February, she led both — with a 10-point lead on Rubio.
The same poll found Clinton ahead of the GOP field in the must-win state of Pennsylvania but with only a 1-point..."
"NEARLY HALF A decade ago, the Russian hackers known as Sandworm hit Western Ukraine with the first-ever cyberattack to cause a blackout, an unprecedented act of cyberwar that turned off the lights for a quarter million Ukrainians. They were just getting started. From there Sandworm embarked on a years-long spree of wantonly destructive attacks: another blackout attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2016, the release of the NotPetya worm in 2017 that spread globally from Ukraine to cause $10 billion in damage, and a cyberattack that temporarily destroyed..."
"Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for 150,000 Russian soldiers to cross the border into Ukraine.
Arriving in Kyiv in January I decided to brave the supermarket near my flat. You could get your hands on just about any kind of meat or vegetable it seemed, even a pint of beer on aisle six.
""It's all a bluff"", ""we're at war already"", were the most common responses when I asked people whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within..."
"Donald Trump's ban from Facebook and Instagram has been upheld by Facebook's Oversight Board.
But it criticised the permanent nature of the ban as beyond the scope of Facebook's normal penalties.
It has ordered Facebook to review the decision and ""justify a proportionate response"" that is applied to everyone, including ordinary users.
The former president was banned from both sites in January following the Capitol Hill riots.
The Oversight Board said the initial decision to permanently suspend Mr Trump was ""indeterminate and standardless"", and that the correct response should be..."
"Following weeks of soaring infections, the latest Covid surge is showing signs of slowing in a handful of areas hit earliest by the omicron variant — offering a glimmer of hope that this wave is starting to ease.
The U.S. has reported an average of nearly 800,000 cases per day over the past week, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, more than three times the level seen during last winter’s previous record. But in a handful of states and cities, particularly on the East Coast, cases appear to..."
"The Texas Supreme Court ordered late Friday that the state’s century-old abortion ban, struck down in Roe v. Wade in 1973, can be enforced immediately in civil court.
That overrules a Harris County judge who had allowed abortion through six weeks to resume temporarily.

"As of early December, about 8.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide. That makes the COVID-19 vaccination effort easily the largest public health intervention in history—and yet, its success has been mixed. The world’s most vulnerable countries have been denied their fair share of vaccination doses, while in wealthier countries, the main problem is not access but hesitancy, often concentrated in specific regions of anti-vaccination sentiment. For example, the eastern German state of Saxony has full vaccination rates of only around 56 percent, and an infection rate more than twice as high as..."
"New measurement method could be a factor in weekly figures, along with slowly improving labor market.
New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, a possible sign of a slowly improving labor market and the impact of a new measurement method.
Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 in the week ended Aug. 29, the Labor Department said Thursday. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits through regular state programs, which cover most workers, decreased by 1.24 million to about 13.3 million for..."
"Hiring surged in February as U.S. economic activity picked up with Covid-19 cases steadily dropping and vaccine rollouts providing hope for more growth.
The Labor Department reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls jumped by 379,000 for the month and the unemployment rate fell to 6.2%. That compared with expectations of 210,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate holding steady from the 6.3% rate in January."
"The second memo that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos issued to Netflix staff about Dave Chappelle and stand-up comedy only proves that he doesn’t understand why people are actually upset about how Chappelle approaches transgender people in his new special “The Closer.” In his first response, Sarandos emphasized that even if “some people find the art of stand-up to be mean-spirited … our members enjoy it.” In the second, he again asserts Chappelle’s right to “artistic freedom.” In both, he underlines that neither he nor anyone with sign-off power at Netflix believe that Chappelle’s extensive material on transgender people..."
"Talks between President Barack Obama and House Republicans to avert a U.S. debt crisis have hit an impasse, House Speaker John Boehner told GOP lawmakers Saturday morning.
His comments, in a closed-door meeting with House Republicans, put renewed focus on a plan being developed by Senate Republicans to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and fully reopen the government."
"The five most valuable tech companies lost more than $269 billion in value on Thursday, the worst day for U.S. stocks since March.
Microsoft was the biggest loser, shedding more than $80 billion in value as shares dropped more than 5%. Shares of Facebook were also down more than 5%, while Apple dropped 4.8%. Alphabet closed 4.29% lower and Amazon shed 3.38%.
Nearly every other tech stock was down as well, with Cisco (-7.91%) and IBM (-9.1%) seeing particularly steep drops. One exception was Zoom Video, which closed..."
"Germany froze a new gas pipeline and Britain hit Russian banks with sanctions on Tuesday, as the West responded to Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine and a speech by President Vladimir Putin suggesting more belligerent aims.
Russia's parliament approved treaties with the two breakaway regions in Ukraine's east, a day after Putin announced he was recognising the independence of enclaves controlled by Russian-backed fighters since 2014.
The prospect of a disruption to energy supplies and fears of war, stoked by reports of shelling and movements of unmarked..."
"U.S. Congressional Democrats plan to introduce articles on Monday to impeach here President Donald Trump for an unprecedented second time after his supporters, inflamed by his false claims of election fraud and his urgings to march on Congress, stormed the U.S. Capitol.
The following is a primer on what a second impeachment proceeding of Trump would look like.
So Trump can be impeached again?
Yes. No president has ever been impeached twice, but legal experts said it is clearly constitutional for Congress to do so.
Trump was previously impeached by..."
"Lots of Democrats are in full panic that Bernie Sanders will win the nomination and get clobbered in the general election — and bring the party down, too. But the evidence, particularly the polling, doesn't back those doomsday warnings.
Why it matters: Virtually every national and swing state poll shows Sanders tied with or beating President Trump. And, unlike every rival, he has a huge base of fervent, unshakable supporters he can only grow.
Just the facts, please: A Quinnipiac Poll last week showed Sanders beating Trump in Michigan and..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday released an updated bill to implement a single-payer health insurance system, a politically divisive hallmark of his White House bid.
The unnumbered Senate bill would transition the U.S. health care system to a single-payer system over a four-year transition and eliminate nearly all premiums, co-pays and deductibles. The legislation largely mirrors Sanders’ 2017 proposal, but the new plan also would cover home and community-based long-term care services through an expanded Medicare program, according to a summary. The earlier version would have maintained those services through..."
"The United States plans to name an ambassador at large for the Arctic, reflecting the region's growing strategic and commercial importance as its shrinking opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.
Russia has reopened hundreds of Soviet-era military sites in the region, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, a day after visiting the Arctic, saying Russian capabilities there pose a strategic challenge to the 30-nation alliance.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,"" has heightened Western concerns about..."
"President Biden said he likely would have to break up his stalled healthcare, education and climate agenda to get his policies through Congress and predicted Russia would make a move against Ukraine, warning that Moscow would face punishing sanctions for doing so.
The president. in a nearly two-hour news conference wrapping up his first year in office, defended his policies and his administration’s response to Covid-19 but also acknowledged that many Americans remain frustrated by the duration of the pandemic."
"Donald Trump says the government should get a cut from the sale of TikTok's US unit if an American firm buys it.
The US president said he made a demand for a ""substantial portion"" of the purchase price in a phone call at the weekend with Microsoft's boss.
He also warned he will ban the app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, on 15 September if there is no deal.
ByteDance is under pressure to sell its US business after Mr Trump threatened a crackdown on Chinese tech companies.
The..."
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tapped seven impeachment managers on Wednesday, ending weeks of speculation over who in the House will step into the political spotlight and make the case to impeach President Trump before the Senate.
Some members who the Speaker tapped were considered shoo-ins, including Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who both had leadership roles during the impeachment inquiry into Trump’s contacts with Ukraine.
Others picked for the high-profile role of managers include Democratic Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.),..."
"The U.S. economy grew rapidly in the second quarter and exceeded its pre-pandemic size, but the outlook has suddenly turned cloudier due to the fast-spreading Delta coronavirus variant.
Virus cases are rising again, particularly in parts of the country where vaccination rates remain low. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week recommended that vaccinated people resume masking indoors in places with high or substantial transmission of coronavirus, leading some local governments and businesses to reinstate restrictions on activity.
Apple Inc., for instance, said it would require workers and customers to wear masks in..."
"President Trump asked his acting chief of staff to place a hold on $391 million in aid to Ukraine more than a week before a July phone call in which he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden ’s son, according to a person familiar with the matter, a revelation that comes as an investigation into the president’s dealings with Kiev is mushrooming on Capitol Hill.
Congress had approved sending military aid to Ukraine to help the country defend against Russian aggression. But Mr. Trump and his advisers, including..."
"The White House walked back President Joe Biden's remark on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" amid his invasion of Ukraine.
The remark closed a speech Biden gave in Warsaw, Poland, where he spoke to about 1,000 people—including Ukrainian refugees—about the conflict, defending democracy and further condemning Putin.
""We will have a different future—a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle; hope and light, decency and dignity; of freedom of possibilities,"" Biden said. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.""
Many initially believed the comment was Biden..."
"(Reuters) - ByteDance is looking to make changes to the corporate structure of its short video app TikTok, a company spokesperson said on Thursday.
TikTok is also in early stages to establish its headquarters, according to a source familiar with the management’s thinking. The company’s five largest offices are in Los Angeles, New York, London, Dublin and Mumbai, it previously said."
"President Joe Biden could find himself under pressure on Monday to prove his much-touted interest in working with Republicans in Congress, as lawmakers return from their spring break to grapple with his $2.3 trillion proposal to improve U.S. infrastructure.
Biden’s party holds slim majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, meaning he can ill afford to lose Democratic votes. That has empowered and emboldened Democratic moderates such as Senator Joe Manchin who have outsize influence over the fate of Biden’s ambitious legislative priorities including the infrastructure package, gun..."
"Ontario has declared a state of emergency in response to two weeks of protests against Covid-19 restrictions.
The order came as demonstrations continue to shut down parts of Ottawa and Windsor's Ambassador Bridge, the most important US-Canada trade link.
Blocking crucial infrastructure would be made ""illegal"" under the order, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.
Protesters could face up to a year in jail and C$100,000 ($79,000; £58,000) in fines, he added.
Mr Ford said the order would apply to anyone impeding the movement of goods, people and services along international..."
"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said COVID-19 can spread through virus lingering in the air, sometimes for hours, acknowledging concerns widely voiced by public health experts about airborne transmission of the virus. The CDC guidance comes weeks after the agency published – and then took down – a similar warning, sparking debate over how the virus spreads.
In Monday’s guidance, CDC said there was evidence that people with COVID-19 possibly infected others who were more than 6 feet away, within enclosed spaces with poor ventilation...."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Sunday led a congressional delegation to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
Why it matters: The visit is a reflection of the growing pressure for the U.S. to send high-level officials to Kyiv, after recent visits by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the prime ministers of Spain and Denmark.
It comes less than a week after Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine.
What we're watching: The trip, which was not previously announced, also includes House Foreign Affairs..."
"Moderna on Thursday released the results of its COVID-19 vaccine trials for those aged 12 to 17, reporting it 96 percent effective against the virus.
The vaccine manufacturer said its trial, involving 3,235 participants, recorded 12 COVID-19 cases that emerged beginning 14 days after the first dose. The company said it had not identified any serious safety concerns to date.
The results of the adolescent trial come as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to give emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be used..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a joint pledge on Thursday to deny Iran nuclear arms, a show of unity by allies long divided over diplomacy with Tehran.
The undertaking, part of a ""Jerusalem Declaration"" crowning Biden's first visit to Israel as president, came a day after he told a local TV station that he was open to ""last resort"" use of force against Iran - an apparent move toward accommodating Israel's calls for a ""credible military threat"" by world powers.
""We will not allow..."
"Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the fiercest and most vocal Republican critic of former President Donald Trump, lost her primary Tuesday night in a race that reinforced Trump’s influence in the party.
The three-term congresswoman faced a challenge from Trump-backed Harriet Hageman, who was once an ally of Cheney and critic of Trump in 2016.
In a pointed address following her concession to Hageman, Cheney, Wyoming’s lone House representative, vowed to continue her fight to make sure Trump is never again elected president.
“Our work is far from over,” she said..."
"US President Donald Trump has said he could declare a national emergency to build a US-Mexico border wall without the approval of Congress.
It came after he met senior Democrats, who refused his requests for funding.
The stand-off has seen Mr Trump withhold support for a bill to fully fund the government until he gets money for the border wall."
"WASHINGTON—President Trump said he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a southern border wall if Congress doesn’t fund it, following a Friday meeting with congressional leaders that both Mr. Trump and Democratic lawmakers described as contentious.
It isn’t clear how Mr. Trump would fund a wall under that scenario, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly face legal challenges if he were to attempt such a move."
"Addressing his fellow world leaders at the COP26 climate summit, President Biden apologized for former President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.
Why it matters: Biden is trying to rally more ambitious climate action at the crucial summit in Glasgow, and he elected to acknowledge the elephant in the room — that it's no sure thing that the only country in the world to withdraw from Paris will be embraced as a moral leader on climate.
What he's saying: ""I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do..."
"The Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday just got much more interesting.
A poll released Tuesday made former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg eligible to take the stage for the first time since launching his campaign in late November.
His rivals will be out to get him.
The billionaire businessman has been rising sharply in the polls — a fact that virtually everyone, friend or foe, attributes to his colossal spending on TV advertising.
In the new national poll from NPR, PBS and Marist, Bloomberg was at..."
"Russia confirmed for the first time on Thursday that it is negotiating with the U.S. regarding a possible prisoner swap deal that would secure the freedom of WNBA star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan.
Driving the news: The news comes after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed last week that Russia was ""ready to discuss"" a potential deal.
A Russian court found Griner guilty on drug charges last week and sentenced her to nine years in prison.
Whelan was arrested in Moscow in 2018 for allegedly possessing classified information. He was sentenced to 16

"Who is Stacey Abrams?
The 46-year old Georgia politician, who in 2018 became the country’s first female major-party African-American gubernatorial nominee, is one of the names being discussed prominently as Joe Biden’s potential 2020 running mate. But how you answer that first question may depend largely on your news preferences or political biases.
If you only read left-leaning news media, you may think Abrams is destined for influence in American politics, and symbolic of the new wave of progressive policy and diverse leadership. If you only read right-rated media, you..."
"On Wednesday Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued final rules on how all schools will address allegations of sexual misconduct, securing new protections for students and faculty accused of misconduct.
The new rules modify Title IX, a 1972 law prohibiting “discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance,” narrowing the definition of sexual harassment and requiring schools to challenge evidence and cross-examine students via a live hearing, among other things detailed in the more than 2,000-page rule.
The new regulations, which take effect in..."
"The megadrought in the Western U.S., the region’s worst in 1,200 years, is threatening America’s cattle heartland: withering pastures, wrecking feed harvests and endangering a quintessential way of life. 
The drought is forcing ranchers here in Texas and across the Southern plains to make an agonizing decision: Sell early now for less money than they planned on — or hold on, pray for rain and risk losing everything. 
“We’ll keep selling cows till it rains,” Texas High Plains rancher Jim Ferguson told Amarillo station KAMR, which collaborated with The Hill..."
"President Donald Trump defended his administration’s deal with Mexico against criticism that there were no major new commitments to stem a flow of Central American migrants crossing into the United States, and said on Sunday more details would soon be released.
Key aspects of the agreement are still unclear, including whether Mexico has pledged to buy more U.S. agricultural products and if the deal materially expanded a previous commitment by Mexico to more vigorously police its southern border with Guatemala.
Top Democratic senators said many aspects of the deal were..."
"The U.S. scrambled three F-22 stealth fighter jets from Hawaii on Sunday in an unscheduled flight that may have been in response to the presence of a Russian Navy exercise.
The missile-armed F-22 Raptors were launched from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, according to Honolulu's Star Advertiser, as a Russian fleet carried out exercises in what Russian authorities say is the largest naval exercise since the Cold War.
The exercise comes ahead of President Joe Biden's meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The two leaders are scheduled to meet in Geneva on..."
"A new $250 million civil fraud lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James against former President Donald Trump and three of his adult children will not lead to jail time.
The 214-page lawsuit seeks the repayment of the money from alleged fraudulent practices and to remove all of the Trumps—including children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka—from their current roles at the Trump Organization. It would also ban them from future leadership roles in New York.
James is also seeking to permanently bar the four Trumps from serving as..."
"The novel coronavirus has killed more than 100,000 people in the United States, according to a Reuters tally on Wednesday, even as the slowdown in deaths encouraged businesses to reopen and Americans to emerge from more than two months of lockdowns.
About 1,400 Americans have died on average each day in May, down from a peak of 2,000 in April, according to the tally of state and county data on COVID-19 deaths.
In about three months, more Americans have died from COVID-19 than during the Korean War, Vietnam War and..."
"The Interior Department will not move forward with planned oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet, it announced Wednesday night. 
A spokesperson for the department confirmed the Cook Inlet lease sale would not proceed due to insufficient industry interest. Meanwhile, the planned sale of two leases, lease 259 and lease 261, in the Gulf of Mexico will not proceed due to contradictory court rulings on the leases, the spokesperson confirmed. 
Shortly after taking office, President Biden signed an executive order freezing all new oil and..."
"Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday blocked attempts to alter a $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and government spending package, leaving its status in doubt after President Donald Trump demanded extensive changes to the legislation.
Democrats sought to increase direct payments to Americans included in the bill from $600 to $2,000 per person as part of a coronavirus economic relief initiative, acting on one of Trump’s requests. Trump’s fellow Republicans, who oppose the higher amount, blocked that effort.
Republicans then moved to change the amount of..."
"When you discount the rhetorical overkill, the most surprising thing about President Trump’s address to the United Nations on Tuesday was how conventional it was. He supported human rights and democracy; he opposed rogue regimes; he espoused a global community of strong, sovereign nations. Pretty shocking stuff."
The high level of income inequality in the United States is at the forefront of policy attention. This paper focuses on one potential policy response: an increase in the top personal income tax rate. We conduct a simulation analysis using the Tax Policy Center (TPC) microsimulation model to determine how much of a reduction in income inequality would be achieved from increasing the top individual tax rate to as much as 50 percent. We calculate the resulting change in income inequality assuming an explicit redistribution of all new revenue to...
"Conservative media figure Ben Shapiro drew controversy on Thursday after he guest wrote Politico’s Playbook newsletter.
The controversy came after Shapiro used the newsletter to defend the House Republicans who opposed impeaching President Trump over his role in inciting last week’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.
The House voted 232 to 197 to impeach Trump for a second time on Wednesday, with 10 Republicans siding with Democrats.
Shapiro wrote that that GOP opposition to impeachment comes from a “deep and abiding conservative belief that members of the opposing political..."
"The Senate next week will begin grilling President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, on his legal philosophy. A look at his writings reveals what senators will likely find: a consistent push to restrain the regulatory state. That was clear in a Senate questionnaire item asking him to list his most significant opinions as a federal judge. Judge Kavanaugh, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, chose a 2008 dissent in which he suggested the high court erred in its unanimous 1935 decision..."
"The U.S. Secret Service has returned $286 million in stolen COVID-19 relief funds to the Small Business Administration, the agency said Friday.
Driving the news: The funds, originally a form of aid to businesses struggling during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, were obtained by scammers using fake identities and dummy accounts, the agency said.
Details: The conspirators used fake IDs to apply for the COVID-19 relief funds and created more than 15,000 accounts using Green Dot Bank ""to conceal and move their criminal proceeds"" with debit cards, the..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress to sharply hike spending on climate change, cancer and underperforming schools, but his first budget wishlist on Friday drew howls of bipartisan concern over military spending.
The $1.5 trillion budget, reflecting an 8% increase in base funding from this year, marks a sharp contrast with the goals of Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.
It would spread billions of dollars more across areas ranging from public transit, poor schools, toxic site clean-ups, foreign aid and background checks on gun sales, but spend nothing on border walls...."
"The whistleblower complaint that focused on President Donald Trump’s request of Ukraine’s government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden also alleges White House officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network, according to a published report.
The Washington Post, citing a person who has read the complaint, reported the whistleblower alleged officials moved communications from Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky onto a different network.
The Wall Street Journal reported the complaint involves more than one episode..."
"Joe Biden holds a significant lead over President Trump on the first day of his party’s convention, polls show, though there are signs the race is tightening.
A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Biden ahead of Trump 53% to 41% nationally, slightly smaller than the 15-point lead in the same poll taken last month.
The poll—conducted August 12 to August 15 in a survey of 868 registered voters—was taken after Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate.
A separate CNN poll released Monday showed..."
"In warfare, there's no such thing as a miracle. 
Yet what happened in early September in the east of Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast may ascend in history as the Miracle on the Oskil River.
Within a few days, a Ukrainian strike prompted the collapse of the Russian front in the region.
To escape a crushing defeat, the Kremlin’s forces were forced to withdraw in a stampede from the territory they had held since March.
Ukraine’s offensive operation has done more than liberate most of Kharkiv Oblast, as Ukrainian units approach the..."
"President Biden and other members of the White House on Saturday took a victory lap following passage of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, quipping that ""infrastructure week"" has finally arrived in Washington.
""Finally, infrastructure week!” Biden said to open his remarks at the White House on Saturday touting passage of the bill. ""I'm happy to say that: infrastructure week.”
The House late Friday passed the bill by a vote of 218-203. Lawmakers sent the legislation to Biden’s desk after a weeks-long standoff over Democrats' larger $1.75 trillion social spending package, which progressives demanded..."
"The call came in on Thursday around noon. A woman called 911 from a neighbor’s house saying her husband was threatening to kill her.
Odgen, Utah, Officer Nate Lyday and an officer from Adult Probation and Parole who was in the area responded to the address. They found the 53-year-old suspect on his front porch. He refused to cooperate, retreated into the house and slammed the door.
The officers apparently never saw a gun, but as they rushed to follow the man, he fired through the door. The parole officer..."
"The United States and other countries hiked their targets for slashing greenhouse gas emissions at a global climate summit hosted by President Joe Biden, an event meant to resurrect U.S. leadership in the fight against global warming.
Biden unveiled the goal to cut emissions by 50%-52% from 2005 levels at the start of a two-day climate summit kicked off on Earth Day and attended virtually by leaders of 40 countries including big emitters China, India and Russia.
The United States, the world's second-leading emitter after China, seeks to reclaim global..."
"More than 280 journalists, editors and other employees at The Wall Street Journal sent a letter to their publisher expressing concerns about misinformation in the paper's opinion section.
The letter says that “opinion’s lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence, undermine our readers’ trust and our ability to gain credibility with sources.”
Among several examples, the employees cite a column by Vice President Pence in which he said fears of a second wave of coronavirus cases were ""overblown"" and argued that the administration's handling of the..."
"The Facebook Papers, a series of articles published by a consortium of 17 U.S. news outlets beginning on Friday, shed new light on the company’s thinking behind its actions leading up to the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6 and its ability to fend of hate speech in languages outside of English.
Facebook shares were slightly negative in premarket trading Monday morning after the news outlets published their stories based on the leaked documents. The company is also scheduled to report quarterly earnings after markets close on Monday.
The documents were provided to..."
"Republicans are looking to craft alternative to President Obama’s Affordable Care Act
President Trump said any vote on a Republican health plan would take place after the 2020 election, moving to put off action on legislation amid uncertainty about what a GOP replacement for the Affordable Care Act would look like.
In a series of tweets late Monday, Mr. Trump said that the vote on a new health plan “will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House.”
Mr. Trump has been..."
"This should be the best of times for low-wage workers, as pandemic-induced labor shortages force employers to sharply raise pay. Yet for many, it doesn’t feel that way, because those same disruptions have pushed inflation to near its highest rate in over a decade.
Troy Sutton, age 61, lost a job as a custodian at the start of the pandemic in 2020 that paid $12 an hour, and he spent more than a year unemployed. This past summer, he landed a job as a custodian at the University of Pennsylvania he said..."
"Romulus — U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib joined airline catering workers who work for Delta Airlines on Friday to protest ""poverty wages and unaffordable healthcare.""
Tlaib locked arms with eight airline workers who sat blocking traffic at Detroit Metropolitan Airport while nearly 100 union members with Unite Here rallied outside Delta's McNamara Terminal departures. The protesters held signs reading ""Delta: one job should be enough.""

"Michigan Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib was detained by police as she participated in a demonstration at Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) Friday. Tlaib joined with airport catering employees in their protest for higher wages and a better health care program.
While Tlaib was not arrested, some protesters with her were taken into custody for blocking a road. Tlaib chose to ride with those arrested.

"A federal grand jury has indicted Baltimore’s top prosecutor Marilyn Mosby on charges of perjury and making false statements with a series of financial transactions that helped her buy a condo on Florida’s Gulf Coast and another property near Orlando, Florida.
Mosby, 41, is charged with falsely claiming to suffer financial hardship from the coronavirus to obtain an early withdrawal from her retirement savings to purchase the homes. In addition, federal prosecutors allege she lied on a mortgage loan application by hiding an outstanding federal tax debt. And they accuse..."
"The new coronavirus has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China.
""The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems.
The death toll now stands at 170 people in China.
The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 countries outside of the country, but no deaths.

"Twitter filed suit against Elon Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery on Tuesday after the billionaire said he was terminating his $44 billion deal to buy the company.
Twitter said Musk, after entering a binding merger agreement, now “refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.”
“Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject..."
"It didn’t start with a retweet.
The controversy currently swirling around The Washington Post doesn’t go back days. It goes back years.
If you want to truly understand how one of the most respected news organizations in the world is smack dab in the middle of a hot mess, you can’t start with a high-profile reporter retweeting a sexist and homophobic tweet. You have to look at the history of the reporter who objected to that retweet and her relationship with the paper she works for, as well as the..."
"A growing number of congressional Republicans want to use a contentious budget procedure to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, according to senior lawmakers and aides involved in discussions over the strategy.
A final decision could be weeks if not months away, but Republican lawmakers and aides say there is broad enthusiasm for using the process known as reconciliation to try to repeal the 2010 health-care law and potentially replace it with a GOP alternative. Another contender, looking less likely now, is using the process for a tax overhaul.
“There is..."
"State legislatures, sleep scientists and the public all seem to agree that the annual rite of springing forward and falling back has got to go. But the nation has not found consensus on what should replace it. 
Nineteen states have passed laws or resolutions in the past five years to make daylight saving time permanent if Congress — and, in some cases, other states — permits the change. Two states, Arizona and Hawaii, have long followed permanent standard time, which the law already allows. 
In standard time, noon arrives when..."
"The top Democrats in Congress said Thursday that a record surge in U.S. coronavirus infections raises the urgency for a new relief bill.
The part of the process that has confounded Washington for months — crafting a bill backed by both Democrats and Republicans — has become no less of a challenge since Election Day.
Speaking to reporters in Washington, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she still supports legislation to inject at least $2.2 trillion into the American health-care system and economy. The California Democrat, who will see her party’s..."
"Job growth rose far more than expected in January despite surging omicron cases that seemingly sent millions of workers to the sidelines, the Labor Department reported Friday.
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 467,000 for the month, while the unemployment rate edged higher to 4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Dow Jones estimate was for payroll growth of 150,000 and a 3.9% unemployment rate.
The stunning gain came a week after the White House warned that the numbers could be low due to the pandemic.
Covid cases, however, have plunged nationally in recent..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday sent back to a lower court a case involving an Oregon bakery whose owners claim the state drove them out of business after they refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple.
In an order, the top court scrapped a ruling from the Oregon Court of Appeals in favor of the same-sex couple. The bakery’s owners, who refused to make the cake due to religious beliefs, said state fines pushed them out of business."
"Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tried Sunday to defuse the rapidly growing international fallout over his deleted tweet that showed support for Hong Kong anti-government protesters, saying he did not intend to offend any of the team’s Chinese fans or sponsors.
Morey apologized on Twitter over a now-deleted tweet that spoke in support of the Hong Kong protests, after his remarks were attacked by the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston and the Chinese Basketball Association."
"Texas announced on Tuesday that it would be filing a lawsuit in the Supreme Court against four battleground states in an effort to halt presidential electors from finalizing President-elect Joe Biden's victory.
Texas argued that electors from Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin should not be allowed to cast their votes in part because those states unconstitutionally changed their voting procedures during the coronavirus pandemic to allow for increased mail-in ballots. Biden won all four states.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) alleges that the new voting processes in the battleground..."
"Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on Wednesday praised Senate Democrats for blocking, at least temporarily, a bill that would give President Barack Obama authority to move trade deals through Congress.
Mr. O’Malley, who is expected to jump into the Democratic race for president later this month, renewed his criticism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Approval of the big trade deal between the U.S. and 1"
"Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley and Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, contradicted President Joe Biden’s claim last month that top military advisers didn’t recommend keeping a residual force in Afghanistan. 
In a Sept. 28 Senate hearing, both generals said they believe the U.S. should have left a residual force of at least 2,500 troops, and that Biden received those recommendations.
But in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Aug. 18, Biden denied that his decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan went against the..."
"The two most striking moments of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's news conference Wednesday came at the very beginning and near the end.
He started the session by staring into the camera and telling the American people that inflation is too high and the Fed is determined to bring it down. Later, when asked a question about what other branches of government could do to fight inflation, he demurred, essentially saying inflation is the Fed's problem to solve.
Why it matters: The Fed may be late in attempting to bring down..."
"The Pentagon on Wednesday ordered military troops to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, according to a memo from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin obtained by AP.
Why it matters: Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday that ""on the active duty force, 68% is fully vaccinated, and we estimate just over 76% have at least one dose.""
Here are figures Kirby provided, by branch:
Army: 40% fully vaccinated with 57% with one dose.
Marine Corps: 53% fully vaccinated, 60% with one dose.

Air Force, which includes Space Force: 57% fully vaccinated, 64%..."
"Vice President Joe Biden got a warm reception from the countrys largest civil-rights organization Thursday as he attacked presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, whose remarks to the same group a day earlier drew loud boos.
“Its good to be home. Its good to be back, Mr. Biden said at the NAACPs annual convention in Houston, as he began an 25-minute speech in which he attacked Mr. Romneys ideas on everything from education to taxes. The vice presidents comfort level was on display as he called out a names in the audience..."
"Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to victory in the U.S. presidential race on Thursday as election officials tallied votes in the handful of states that will determine the outcome and protesters took to the streets.
President Donald Trump alleged fraud without providing evidence, filed lawsuits and called for recounts in a race yet to be decided two days after polls closed.
The race was coming down to close contests in five states. Biden held narrow leads in Nevada and Arizona while Trump was watching his slim advantage fade in must-win..."
"Republicans are holding up Mayra Flores’s win in the special election for Texas’ 34th Congressional District Tuesday as the latest sign Hispanic voters are shifting toward the GOP and hoping her win is the first of many this year for Republicans running in heavily-Latino districts.
But the race also showed Republicans may need to make large investments to capture such seats, and the unusual nature of a low-turnout special election using district lines that will change in just a few months makes it difficult to say if the contest was a..."
"The announcement that a pill from Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics kept Covid patients out of the hospital made headlines and moved stocks late last week. But as is so often true when data are released by press release, there are still many questions left unanswered.
Doctors are excited about the medicine, molnupiravir, because a regimen of pills, even one that involves taking several pills twice a day for five days, should be far easier to deliver to patients than current antiviral Covid-19 treatments, which must be given intravenously. But it’s still..."
"Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked a Republican push to unanimously pass a bill to put $250 billion more into a loan program for small businesses devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.
With only a few senators in the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to approve the measure by a unanimous vote. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., objected to the request, stalling the legislation.
Speaking on the Senate floor, McConnell said he was not “talking about changing any policy language” the parties negotiated last month as part of an..."
"Michael Bloomberg refused to run. Howard Schultz is still on the fence. That makes Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager from California, the first billionaire to officially challenge America’s first billionaire commander-in-chief for the presidency.
Forbes estimates Steyer’s net worth to be $1.6 billion, making him about half as rich as Trump (worth $3.1 billion) but far wealthier than any other presidential candidate. He has an 1,800-acre cattle ranch and a San Francisco mansion with views of the Golden Gate Bridge. But he mostly focuses his fortune on..."
"Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to advance Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination after Democrats boycotted the vote.
The panel voted 12-0 to send Barrett’s nomination to the full Senate, paving the way for President Trump’s nominee to be confirmed to the Supreme Court early next week. Every Republican on the panel supported her nomination and no Democratic senator voted.
Every GOP senator was present for the vote, meeting the committee's rule that 12 members of the panel must be present to report a..."
"Russia’s new offensive in the Donbas region could prove to be extremely significant and decisive in the war, analysts warn, and could determine how the country’s territorial boundaries look in weeks and years to come.
“The Russian war machine in the east could prove to be a very painful threat for Ukraine quickly,” Maximilian Hess, fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC Tuesday.
“It’s quite clear that Russia’s war aims remain quite extensive,” Hess added, saying that how the battle for Donbas proceeds “will determine how much of..."
"WNBA star Brittney Griner was found guilty on drug charges by a Russian court and sentenced to nine years in prison on Thursday, concluding a trial that has captured national attention and reached the highest levels of U.S. diplomacy.
Why it matters: Griner's conviction comes nearly six months after she was arrested at a Moscow airport in February, when Russian authorities said they found a vape cartridge with hashish oil in her luggage.
State of play: During closing arguments Thursday, Russian prosecutors asked that Griner be sentenced to 9.5 years in prison, AP reported."
"Whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden gets sworn in as president in January, the composition of the Senate will shape what they can accomplish.
Republicans and Democrats have settled into the final weeks of a high-stakes fight for two years of Senate control. The party that wins a majority will not only dictate what policies the president can pass — on issues from health care to taxes and climate change — but also play a role in who he puts on federal courts.
The GOP holds a 53-47..."
"The FBI on Monday executed a search warrant at former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in what one former federal prosecutor called the ""most important search warrant in the history of the United States.""
The big picture: The search appeared to mark a dramatic escalation in the investigation into Trump's handling of presidential documents.
Two sources familiar with Monday's investigation told Axios' Jonathan Swan that it was their understanding that the raid was related to documents Trump took from the White House that may have been classified.
It is unclear what specific evidence the FBI sought from..."
"Possibly. But the reality is that slogans and rhetoric make very little difference in elections.
Tuesday’s big flap was an interview at Vox with James Carville, who accused Democrats of being too “woke” and using “faculty lounge” language instead of rhetoric voters like. Kevin Drum adds: “one thing that’s clear is that Republicans sure think that attacking wokeness is a winning strategy.”
I’m not so sure. The truth is that all the rhetoric probably doesn’t matter much. If the economy is doing well, then the president’s party benefits. Voters tend..."
"Hillary Clinton will launch her second campaign for the White House on Sunday with much less fanfare than the standard 2016 rollout: She’ll post a video online, followed by small events with voters spaced out slowly over coming weeks.
The strategy stands in contrast to Republican contenders, who have kicked o"
"Pennsylvania and Nevada on Tuesday officially certified that President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in both states’ elections, making Trump’s effort to reverse Biden’s projected win in the Electoral College even more unlikely to succeed.
The certifications of Biden’s victory in both states — where the Trump campaign had challenged new mail-in ballot processes — came came a day after Michigan certified that he had won the election in that state.
It also came a day after the Trump administration authorized the release of federal funds to the former..."
"Forty-nine people have been killed and at least 20 wounded in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the incident as a terrorist attack and one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"".
A man in his late twenties was charged with murder and will appear in court on Saturday morning, police confirmed.
Two other men and one woman were detained nearby and firearms and explosive devices recovered, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said.
He said one of those detained was later released, while officers were working..."
"President Joe Biden on Saturday morning signed into law a bipartisan gun control bill that swiftly passed Congress this week, marking the most significant action the federal government has taken on gun control in decades.
Biden gave a brief speech before signing the bill, listing the measures the bill takes and saying it is a ""monumental day"" for America and “lives will be saved.”
The president's signature clears the way for new federal grants to encourage states to enact red-flag laws, enhances background checks for gun buyers under the age..."
"This is a hard column to write. Today Russia hived off part of Ukraine as if it were its garden with apple trees to pick off. Ukraine is an independent country; it is not Chechnya.
As a journalist and foreign policy practitioner, I am used to blaming governments, including my own, for global messes.
But in the case of Ukraine, I find myself realizing that the source of many of the problems besetting this fragile democracy is not only Russia or its president, Vladimir Putin. Part of the blame lies with..."
"Representative Richard Neal invoked law that allows House Ways and Means Committee chair to obtain any person’s tax information.
The chairman of the House tax-writing committee formally requested President Trump’s tax returns on Wednesday, kicking off what could be a bruising legal fight between Congress and the Trump administration.
In a letter to the Internal Revenue Service, Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.) asked for six years of Mr. Trump’s personal returns and some of his business returns, invoking a federal law that allows the chairman of the House Ways and..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday found that a criminal defendant can be sentenced for violating his supervised release, even if the release expires while he is incarcerated ahead of facing new charges.
The justices, divided in the 5-4 decision, ruled against Jason Mont's argument that a district court shouldn't be able to charge him for violating his release because the term had expired at the time of the new sentencing.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sided with conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh in the majority...."
"President Biden on Thursday unveiled a comprehensive strategy to address the coronavirus pandemic while warning that it would take months for his administration’s actions to significantly alter the trajectory of the pandemic.
Biden, seeking to manage expectations as the United States confronts a dire period of infections, said that the COVID-19 death toll would likely top 500,000 in February and that it would take months to get Americans vaccinated against the virus.
“We didn’t get into this mess overnight and it’s going to take months for us to turn..."
"The White House has proposed giving the government greater power to seize and sell the assets of Russian oligarchs, and transfer their proceeds to Ukraine.
The legislative proposal, released on Thursday morning, will be presented to Congress for consideration.
The measures would make it easier for the US to seize and sell oligarchs' assets, and use the funds ""to remediate harms of Russian aggression"".
Similar legislation was recently passed in the US House of Representatives.
But the new White House plans go further by calling for inter-agency collaboration between the..."
"Washington’s efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine continued to ramp up Monday, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers announced an agreement on a “legislative path forward to ban the import of energy products from Russia and to suspend normal trade relations with both Russia and Belarus.”
The agreement involves the House Ways and Means Committee’s chairman, Democratic Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, and its top Republican, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, along with the Senate Finance Committee’s chairman, Democratic..."
"The United States is ending its combat mission in Iraq, President Joe Biden announced Monday, though U.S. troops will remain in the country to continue training and advising local forces.
“Our role in Iraq will be...to be available to continue to train, to assist to help and to deal with ISIS as it arises, but we are not going to be by the end of the year in a combat mission,” Biden said at the beginning of a meeting in the Oval Office with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi.

"A bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion coronavirus relief proposal on Tuesday, as leadership faces growing pressure to cut a deal.
The measure, rolled out by more than a dozen members from the House and Senate, comes as cases are climbing across the country and Congress is running out of time to clinch a long-stalled fifth bill with lawmakers scheduled to leave for the year as soon as next week.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said it would be ""inexcusable"" for Congress to leave town for the year without..."
"Today is 4/20, the holiday for stoners and weed enthusiasts around the world. Legalizing marijuana is no longer a fringe issue championed mainly by those partaking in the day’s festivities either. Over the past two decades, we’ve seen a remarkable rise in support for legalization. Polls over the past year from Civiqs, Quinnipiac and Gallup show that roughly 7 in 10 American adults think the use of cannabis should be legal, double the share who thought so 20 years ago.
In fact, a majority of registered voters in all 50 states now favor making cannabis legal, according..."
"Ukraine will introduce a nationwide state of emergency in which special restrictions will apply in order to keep the country calm and protect its economy amid fears of a Russian invasion, a senior Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday.
The state of emergency will last for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days, Oleksiy Danilov told a briefing. Parliament must now vote to enact the decision.
Introducing a state of emergency gives powers to the authorities, who can choose which ones to implement. These could include restrictions..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to hold a vote to acquit President Trump should the president ultimately be impeached in the House rather than move to dismiss any articles of impeachment sent from the lower chamber.
CNN, citing two Republican senators, reported Thursday that the Senate GOP wants to have a vote for acquittal to try to clear the president of any wrongdoing stemming from his dealings with Ukraine rather than a majority vote to simply dismiss impeachment.
The Constitution requires articles of impeachment to garner 67..."
"Iranian authorities and a Kurdish rights group reported rising death tolls on Wednesday as anger at the death of a woman detained by the morality police fuelled protests for a fifth day and fresh restrictions were placed on social media.
Iranian media and a local prosecutor said four people were killed in the last two days, bringing the total death toll according to official sources to eight, including a member of the police and a pro-government militia member.
The demonstrations erupted over the death in detention last week of Mahsa..."
"The biggest retailer in the world has agreed to boost its U.S. workers’ pay to $9 an hour, which is $1.75 above the federal minimum wage. Walmart announced the wage hike Thursday, adding that it expects employees to earn at least $10 an hour by Feb. 1, 2016. Both full-time and part-time employees will benefit from the increase. The retailer also announced that employees’ schedules will be set at least 2 1/2 weeks in advance and some workers will be given fixed shifts."
"The big question on Florida Democrats’ minds: Can they beat Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)?
The party’s voters on Tuesday are set to choose between Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), a former Republican governor who’s making his second attempt at reclaiming his old office, and state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the lone statewide elected Democrat, in the primary to challenge DeSantis this fall. 
But while few Republicans ignite the same kind of outrage among Democrats as DeSantis does, it’s unclear whether the party has the candidates — or the firepower — to..."
"The White House is looking to thread a policy needle by embracing more U.S. liquefied natural gas shipments to Europe while insisting it's not backing off its commitment to fighting climate change.
Driving the news: On Friday, U.S. and European leaders announced a task force focused on helping to cut the EU's heavy reliance on Russian fossil fuels and boosting clean energy.
The broad outline calls for U.S. work with ""international partners"" to find another 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year.
Longer term, it calls for ""additional"" EU imports of roughly..."
"ABC News suspended “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks after she said the Holocaust was not about race, the network said Tuesday.
In a statement, Kim Godwin, president of ABC News, called Goldberg’s comments “wrong and hurtful.”
“While Whoopi has apologized, I’ve asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments,” Godwin said. “The entire ABC News organization stand in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family and communities.”
Goldberg made the comments Monday morning while the panel was discussing a Tennessee school board’s banning..."
"In an extraordinary bow to former President Trump, House Republicans voted Wednesday to purge GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney from her leadership post, punishing the conservative Wyoming Republican for daring to refute Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
The decision was made by voice vote, meaning there will be no tally of the lawmakers who voted to dump Cheney, or of those who wanted her to stay on. Sources inside the closed-door vote said it was an overwhelming vote against Cheney.
That represents a remarkable shift from..."
"Hurricane Ian plowed into Florida's Gulf Coast with catastrophic force on Wednesday, unleashing howling winds, torrential rains and a treacherous surge of ocean surf that made it one of the most powerful U.S. storms in recent years.
Ian made landfall at 3:05 p.m. EDT (1905 GMT) near Cayo Costa, a barrier island just west of Fort Myers, as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of up to 150 miles per hour (241 km per hour), the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported.

"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Thursday will try to force Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to read out loud a question regarding the anonymous whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry.
Paul’s strategy, outlined on Twitter by his spokesman, will escalate a standoff between the two men on the Senate floor after much behind-the-scenes haggling.
“Senator Paul will insist on his question being asked during today’s trial. Uncertain of what will occur on the Senate floor, but American people deserve to know how this all came about,” Sergio..."
"Electors from every state will meet on Monday to formally elect Joe Biden as the next president amid an unprecedented effort by President Trump to overturn the election.
The Electoral College vote, which comes after all 50 states have certified their results, is not in doubt. Biden should finish with 306 votes, compared to 232 for Trump.
But the vote will take place as the sitting president refuses to accept the outcome, which has never happened in modern times.
Trump and his allies have doubled down on unsubstantiated claims that..."
"A 15-year-old male suspect was in a North Carolina hospital in critical condition on Friday after he went on a shooting spree that led to an hours-long manhunt and left five people dead in the state capital, Raleigh's police chief said.
Police have yet to determine a motive for the shooting, which turned a quiet middle-class neighborhood into a two-mile-wide 2 mile (3.2-km-wide) crime scene on Thursday, Police Chief Estella Patterson said during a news conference on Friday.
Patterson did not identify the suspect by name or say how he..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that Americans, particularly those who are fully vaccinated, shouldn’t hesitate to spend holidays with their families this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, clarifying earlier comments he had made that expressed more doubt about whether people could safely gather.
Fauci said on ABC’s This Week he “believe[s] strongly” that Americans can “enjoy the holidays,” “particularly … if you’re vaccinated and your family members are vaccinated.”

"Facebook is not doing enough to stop the spread of false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday, part of a new administration pushback on misinformation in the United States.
Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, needs to work harder to remove inaccurate vaccine information from its platform, Psaki said.
She said 12 people were responsible for almost 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. The finding was reported in May by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, but Facebook has disputed..."
"More than three-quarters of Republican-led states plan to end an extra $300-a-week in federal jobless benefits early, as unemployment claims reached a new pandemic low, likely triggering a decrease in the number of benefits recipients this summer.
The development came as initial unemployment claims through regular state programs dropped to 444,000 last week, the lowest level since the pandemic hit in mid-March 2020. Weekly claims are still more than double their average of 218,000 in 2019 ahead of the pandemic.

"North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, South Korea's military says, its first ballistic missile test in six months.
The tests, a breach of UN resolutions, came as South Korea and China held meetings in an effort to get the North to resume denuclearisation talks.
The launches show the North has continued to develop its weapons despite a severe economic crisis.
Hours later, the South tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile.
The test of the missile known as SLBM was pre-planned and not in reaction to..."
"Former President Trump's business charged Secret Service agents ""excessive nightly rates"" at its properties during dozens of trips, according to documents released Monday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
Driving the news: Some charges were as high as $1,185 per room per night at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. — more than five times the government rate, according to the committee.
Why it matters: Trump maintained ownership of the Trump Organization throughout his presidency through a revocable trust, with his oldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., at the helm.
The documents released..."
"Covid-19 cases in the United States are skyrocketing as winter sets in, with some of the most highly vaccinated states—including four of the top five most vaccinated—fighting to contain the country’s worst outbreaks, prompting officials to reinstate restrictions and ramp up booster efforts to ease the burden on struggling hospitals. 
Of the five states with the highest proportion of residents fully vaccinated against Covid-19, four—Rhode Island, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, in positions two through five, respectively—are now battling the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the country, according to data collated by the New York..."
"Findings don’t support Trump’s accusation that Joe Biden sought to remove a prosecutor to protect a gas firm whose board Hunter Biden served on.
Two Obama administration officials raised concerns to the White House in 2015 about Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural-gas company while his father, then Vice President Joe Biden, led U.S. policy efforts toward the country, a Senate investigation by Republicans concluded.
The GOP-led probe shows that officials working on U.S.-Ukraine relations saw Hunter Biden’s position as creating the perception of a conflict..."
"The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has scored its first win in its case investigating Donald Trump's potential mishandling of classified records after leaving office, after a panel of appeals court judges granted its request to be allowed to examine classified documents seized from the former president.
Last month, the FBI raided Trump's beach club and home Mar-a-Lago in Florida, seizing thousands of files, 103 of which were marked as classified, including 54 labeled secret and 18 labeled top secret.
Trump has denied mishandling the sensitive materials and said that..."
"President Trump on Thursday plans to announce an executive action related to the census, according to a White House official.
The action is expected to address the citizenship question that the Supreme Court recently blocked the administration from adding to the 2020 census. Trump tweeted that he will hold a news conference in the afternoon “on the Census and Citizenship.”
White House officials declined to discuss the content of the executive action, but said it may not be a full-blown executive order.
Trump has hinted in recent days that he..."
"President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Friday that momentum would shift back in favor of Democrats for the November midterm elections, despite polls favoring Republicans in races that will determine which party controls the U.S. Congress.
Fresh from a trip to Pennsylvania on Thursday to boost John Fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, Biden said legislative wins and economic trends would push Democrats towards a win.
""The polls have been all over the place,"" Biden told reporters at the White House after speaking about..."
"Georgia U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has labeled three fellow Republicans who may vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's appointment to the Supreme Court as ""pro-pedophile.""
Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah joined Democrats in voting to force Jackson's nomination out of the deadlocked Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. They are also likely to vote in favor of Jackson's appointment when a full Senate vote is expected to take place by the end of the week.

"China said on Monday it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, striking back in its trade war with Washington shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump warned it not to retaliate.
China’s finance ministry said it plans to set import tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent on 5,140 U.S. products on a target list worth about $60 billion. It said the tariffs will take effect on June 1.
The announcement came less than two hours after Trump warned Beijing not to retaliate after China said..."
"President Joe Biden on Thursday said he expects to run for president again in 2024 and defended his policy to provide shelter to unaccompanied children crossing the U.S. border from Mexico at his first solo news conference since taking office.
Biden also set a new goal of administering 200 million vaccination shots against COVID-19 in the United States in his first 100 days in office and claimed economic progress as he held his first solo news conference since taking office.
He warned North Korea of consequences for launching two ballistic..."
"Months after Delta threatened the fall back-to-school ritual, COVID-19 is again complicating kids' return to the classroom.
Why it matters: While government officials worked to convince school administrators and parents over the last several days that kids could safely get back to in-person learning after the holidays, the reality on the ground amid the spread of Omicron is much more complicated.
What they're saying: ""I still believe very firmly and very passionately, not only as an educator but as a parent, that our students belong in the classroom and that we can do..."
"Health officials across the world are issuing warnings over the use of antimalarial drugs after President Trump’s comments about treating the coronavirus with them sparked panic-buying and overdoses.
In recent days, thousands of consumers across Africa and South Asia rushed to stockpile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs that are usually used to combat malaria, vacuuming up supplies in cities in the developing world, sending prices skyrocketing and prompting panicked warnings from local authorities.
In the U.S. and some other developed countries, meantime, some doctors have started to prescribe the drugs against..."
"Negotiations over a mammoth stimulus package to address the coronavirus crisis spilled over into Monday as top members of leadership and administration officials tried to revive hopes of a bipartisan deal.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin left the Capitol around midnight, still unable to clinch a bipartisan agreement despite three days of around-the-block negotiations.
White House director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland, asked where the divides are, said there were still a “handful of issues” that remained as sticking..."
"Newly elected president Joe Biden’s inaugural address couldn’t have been clearer about his highest priority: to restore unity.
It is both a lofty and necessary goal. Unity is Biden’s only path to swiftly address the country’s spiraling health and economic crises in the wake of a president who derived his legitimacy from sowing division and distrust. “We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we..."
"Steve Bannon, former White House senior strategist to Donald Trump, has hit out at the ""phony"" charges against him following reports he is due to surrender to prosecutors in New York as a part of a federal fraud case.
Bannon is facing a new criminal indictment in a case similar to the fraud investigation for which he was pardoned by Trump (just as the former president was leaving office), and is preparing to hand himself in on Thursday, The Washington Post reported.
In the 2020 case, Bannon and several other..."
"Mr Biden made the remarks after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider at Arlington National Cemetery in honour of Veterans Day.
Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel was to deliver remarks at the Vietnam War memorial in Washington DC.
The US first began celebrating Veterans Day to honour all US veterans in place of Armistice Day in 1954."
"A man who was spotted asking for beer money on ESPN's ""College GameDay"" broadcast has apologized for racist tweets that were uncovered by The Des Moines Register.
The Register reported that it uncovered two racist jokes in Carson King's previous tweets, noting that one compared black mothers to gorillas and another made light of black people killed in the Holocaust.
The tweets were from 2012, when King was 16 years old.
King told local NBC affiliate WHO 13 that a reporter for the Register contacted him after his initial appearance..."
"President Biden will sign an order Friday to keep the number of refugee admissions this year at the historically low figure set by the Trump administration, walking back a campaign promise to raise the cap, a senior administration official confirmed to Axios.
Why it matters: Biden has faced mounting pressure to increase the limit as he pledged, with his administration set to accept the lowest number of refugees this year of any modern president, including former President Trump.
Instead of raising the cap, Biden is instead adjusting allocation limits to..."
"The Senate voted 50-49 on Thursday to confirm Xavier Becerra as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Why it matters: Becerra, the first Latino to lead the department, is now in charge of overseeing the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic while executing much of the Biden administration's health agenda.
Context: Becerra was one of President Biden's most controversial nominees. He sued the Trump administration more than 100 times while attorney general for the state of California, and Republicans, who largely opposed the confirmation, said he was..."
"Congress overwhelmingly approved $900 billion of relief for households and businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic, passing an emergency measure aimed at buoying the country through a difficult winter and into a new year.
The bill now heads to the White House, where President Trump is expected to sign it into law.
The Senate voted 92-6 late Monday to approve both the infusion of coronavirus aid, together with a $1.4 trillion spending bill that will fund the government through September. Initially, the Senate’s presiding officer said the vote was 91-7,..."
"HBO's House of the Dragon, the prequel to the hit show Game of Thrones, made headlines for its diversity casting, with Black actors being given major roles in the show. The headlines weren't all positive; the casting somewhat flew in the face of the plot, which revolves around the race-purity obsessed Targaryen family. It was jarring to many, including myself, to suddenly see Black actors portraying characters with Valyrian ancestry married into the Targaryen family fold, like Steve Toussaint, who portrays Lord Coryls Velaryon. But others extolled the decision, casting..."
"The New York Times Opinion section on Saturday apologized for a political cartoon that included anti-Semitic tropes.
The image, published in the international print edition of Thursday’s paper, featured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog wearing a Star of David collar leading President Trump, who is wearing a skullcap and dark glasses.
“The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it,” the newspaper said in a tweet. “It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since..."
"President Joe Biden on Monday pledged to support governors struggling with the omicron variant of Covid-19,  but acknowledged the states will need to take the lead in controlling the pandemic.
Speaking just before a meeting with some of the nation’s governors, Biden said: “There is no federal solution. This gets solved at a state level.”
Those comments represent one of the most explicit acknowledgements to date from the Biden administration that it will need help from state and local governments in its efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19.
The president may be..."
"The Trump administration is working on regulations that will require health care providers and insurers to tell patients how much a service will cost before they get it.
President Trump, in an executive order issued Monday, directed the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies to put out rules requiring hospitals disclose prices that reflect what patients and insurers “actually pay” for services, Azar told reporters.
The rules aim to bring more transparency to a health care system where patients usually don’t find out how much a procedure..."
"Gasoline prices surged to the highest level on record Tuesday as oil holds steady above $100 a barrel, contributing to inflationary pressures across the economy.
The national average for a regular gallon of gas hit an all-time high of $4.374 on Tuesday, according to AAA. The price is not adjusted for inflation.
Prices have been rising at a fast clip, with the ascent accelerating after Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy markets reeling.
The national average crossed above $4 in March for the first time since 2008, and has remained above ever since.

"Federal regulators have ordered Google to assure employees they are allowed to speak out on political and workplace issues, people familiar with the matter say, as part of a settlement of formal complaints that the search giant punishes those who do just that.
The National Labor Relations Board’s move offers Google an escape hatch from a thorny issue that has roiled the business in recent years. Though Google executives have long bragged about having a workplace culture designed to encourage open debate, current and former employees across the political spectrum..."
"Over the weekend I was angsting about how to address the last of my holiday cards. What’s the proper form for a same-sex couple? Or a modern widow, even a divorcee? And what about when one spouse has a professional title — like reverend, judge or doctor — like my friends, Dr. Amanda Cook and her husband, Ian Cook. Doing this correctly is not always easy or intuitive, which is one reason why titles have generally gone the way of dinosaurs. Then there’s the other reason: Americans like the fiction..."
"President Trump denied knowing about a White House request to move “out of sight” the warship USS John S. McCain during his visit to Japan, but said whoever issued the directive was “well meaning.”
Speaking to reporters Thursday as he left Washington for Colorado, Mr. Trump said of the White House request, which was issued earlier this month: “I didn’t know a thing about it. I would never have done that.”
The president repeated his previous criticisms of the late senator and didn’t apologize for the White House directive, saying..."
"Awitness who stood before a grand jury investigating Hunter Biden's connections with a Chinese energy conglomerate was reportedly asked to identify the “big guy” mentioned in an email that detailed propositions for a company established to take part in the joint venture.
A source with knowledge of the proceedings that seek details about Hunter Biden’s tax payments and foreign business dealings told the New York Post that the question regarding the “big guy” emerged after the witness was shown a piece of evidence.
Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, had..."
"On this Memorial Day weekend, as we reflect on the brave actions of those who died in battle so that we might live free, it’s also fitting for us to consider the moral causes of our time. One such cause is playing out across the Pacific in the metropolis called Hong Kong.
If that island city seems like a distant land worthy only of someone else’s concern, that might be because it is easy to lose perspective while sitting inside our own borders. The truth is that our economic strength,..."
"In a potentially unprecedented escalation, Iran's top nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi announced on Tuesday that the Islamic Republic has begun 60% uranium enrichment, according to state media, Reuters reported.
In order for uranium to be weaponized, it must be enriched to 90%.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran had to stay below 5% nuclear enrichment.
However, both before the nuclear deal and since the Islamic Republic started violating the deal in 2019-2020, it has enriched some of its uranium stock to a mid-level 20%.
Even the jump..."
"We have a slate of candidates for the November election.
There were some expected results, including Attorney General Maura Healey’s victory march through a largely uncontested Democratic primary for governor. And conservative firebrand Geoff Diehl closed the deal on the Republican side, though opponent Chris Doughty showed a little pluck toward the end of that race, nabbing some high-profile endorsements and garnering enough votes to keep things close for about an hour after polls closed.

"A police raid has finally put an end to the costly bridge blockade at Windsor, Ontario, with the crossing reopening for traffic on Sunday night after a six-day protest. But with the demonstrations in Ottawa still going strong, is any end in sight for the anti-mandate movement?
This was the moment the protesters had dreaded.
""I was hoping it wasn't going to end like this, I was hoping the police would allow us to continue to peacefully protest,"" Tyler Kok told the BBC as he left the site.
The officers..."
"The United States and Taiwan have agreed to start trade talks under a new initiative to reach agreements with ""economically meaningful outcomes"", with a Taiwan official saying China's ""economic coercion"" would also be discussed.
Washington and Taipei unveiled the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade in June, just days after the Biden administration excluded the Chinese-claimed island from its Asia-focused economic plan designed to counter China's growing influence. 
The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the two sides had ""reached consensus on the negotiating mandate"" and it was expected that..."
"The Justice Department's inspector general has released a report detailing former FBI Director James Comey's handling of classified information in the Russia investigation.
The big picture: President Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly accused Comey of lying and leaking, have hoped that this report would vindicate Trump’s claims that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt. The inspector general found that Comey violated DOJ and FBI policies and his employment agreement, but after evaluating the IG's findings, the Justice Department declined prosecution."
"The Milwaukee Bucks decided to “strike” and not take the floor for their playoff game today in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. The game between the Bucks and the Orlando Magic was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, but the teams remained in their respective locker rooms.
Games between the Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers were then also postponed, according to the NBA."
"U.S. stocks posted strongest gains Thursday after Beijing indicated it wasn’t in a rush to respond to the latest round of tariffs imposed by Washington.
How did the major benchmarks faring?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.25% advanced 326.15 points, or 1.3%, to end at 26,362.25, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.27% rose 36.64 points, or 1.3%, to finish at 2,924.58. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.48% added 116.51 points, or 1.5%, to close at 7,973.39.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied more than 1% on Thursday, buoyed by gains in the trade-sensitive technology and industrial sectors as China expressed hope on trade negotiations with the United States, easing concerns that rising tensions could stoke a recession.
China’s commerce ministry said both sides are discussing the next round of talks scheduled for September, but progress would be determined by whether Washington could create favorable conditions.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Fox News radio interview that trade talks were scheduled for Thursday “at a..."
"President Joe Biden is a very different national leader than his predecessor. But when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world, there are similarities: President Biden has kept in place some major Trump foreign policies that candidate Biden decried as ineffective or inhumane.
Exhibit A for this may be the forced deportation of Haitians from a crowded makeshift camp in Texas. Images of Border Patrol agents on horseback confronting migrants seemed painfully reminiscent of aggressive Trump-era southern border controls.
Mr. Biden also, of course, withdrew U.S. troops..."
"US lawmaker Katie Hill has announced her resignation from Congress, following allegations that she had an affair with a Capitol Hill aide.
The California Democrat, who has denied the claim, said she was stepping down with a ""broken heart"".
""I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country,"" she wrote on Twitter.
The resignation came days after she was placed under investigation by the House of Representatives Ethics Committee.
Why is there an investigation?
The ethics committee launched an inquiry after conservative blog..."
"Hours after canceling negotiations with Democrats over stimulus legislation on Tuesday and pledging to pass a bill after the election, President Trump backtracked by calling on Congress to send him standalone bills that would cover individual aspects of the package under negotiation.
Trump called on Congress to “IMMEDIATELY approve” $25 billion in airline payroll support and $135 billion in funding for the paycheck protection program through unused funds in the CARES Act, before adding that he would sign a standalone $1,200 stimulus check bill and tagging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,..."
"Johnson & Johnson must pay $572 million for contributing to an opioid-addiction crisis in Oklahoma, a judge there ruled Monday in a closely watched trial.
The verdict comes in the first case to go to trial of more than 2,000 brought by state and local municipalities nationwide seeking to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for widespread opioid abuse.
In siding with the Oklahoma attorney general, state court judge Thad Balkman rejected Johnson & Johnson’s arguments that it lawfully marketed and sold its prescription painkillers and isn’t to blame for a..."
"President Trump is going all in. He declared he has the ""absolute right"" to call for foreign nations to investigate political rivals — publicly calling on China to investigate the Bidens — and he plans to ask Democrats to vote on starting impeachment or get stonewalled.
Why it matters: It now seems increasingly inevitable the House will impeach Trump. Think about it this way: Imagine a Democrat who called for impeachment before the China comment voting against impeachment after it."
"TOPLINE With the House of Representatives passing the $3 trillion Heroes Act late on Friday, political leaders have largely reacted to the legislation along party lines, with Democrats urging for immediate action in the Senate while Republicans condemned the bill and reiterated that it is dead on arrival.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reiterated his support for the bill and called for action in the Senate, urging McConnell that “we need to act NOW” because “Americans can’t afford to wait.”"
"The Los Angeles Latino council members who used racist language in a leaked recording have exposed the conflicts — but also the solidarity — between Black and Latino residents.
Why it matters: As the country, especially major cities, becomes more diverse, how Latinos and Black Americans work together today may define the nation's future around civil rights and equality.
Driving the news: Los Angeles councilmember Nury Martinez resigned from office yesterday following pressure from a coalition of Black and Latino activists and political leaders over her racist remarks during a..."
"Republicans pushed Democrats out of the Virginia governorship and had a far stronger-than-expected showing in heavily Democratic New Jersey on Wednesday, signaling trouble for President Joe Biden's party heading into next year's congressional elections.
Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former private equity executive, claimed victory over Democratic former Governor Terry McAuliffe in Tuesday's vote after distancing himself just enough from former President Donald Trump to win back moderates who had supported Biden just a year ago.
In New Jersey, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelliperformed far better than expected against incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy,even..."
"The Trump administration dropped plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form, a turnaround after days of defiant statements following last week’s Supreme Court decision to halt the query.
“We can confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020 decennial census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process,” a Justice Department attorney told lawyers for New York state and the American Civil Liberties Union by email Tuesday afternoon. She provided no explanation, and neither..."
"Former President Trump, advised by an ""apparently inebriated"" Rudy Giuliani, agreed to falsely declare victory in the 2020 election when it ""was far too early to be making any calls like that,"" Trump advisers testified during the second public hearing into the Jan. 6 insurrection.
Driving the news: ""The mayor was definitely intoxicated,"" Jason Miller, Trump’s former spokesperson said of Giuliani.
Jan. 6 committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) also said that Trump followed advice on election night by an ""apparently inebriated"" Giuliani.
“It was far too early to be..."
"During a campaign call on Monday, President Trump slammed infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, calling him a ""disaster,"" and that ""people are tired of COVID,"" according to multiple reporters who listened to the call.
Driving the news: CBS's ""60 Minutes"" aired an interview Sunday night with the NIAID director, where he said he was ""absolutely not"" surprised Trump contracted COVID-19 after seeing him on TV in a crowded place with ""almost nobody wearing a mask.""
What he's saying: ""Every time he goes on television there's always a bomb, but there's..."

Driving the news: The announcement applies to international air travel and travel across U.S. land borders.
Effective Nov. 8, foreign national air travelers must provide proof of being fully vaccinated to be eligible to fly to the U.S. Fully vaccinated travelers will also..."
"U.S. health regulators cleared use of a Covid-19 booster from Pfizer Inc. PFE -3.38% and BioNTech SE BNTX -6.26% in adolescents 12 to 15 years old, expanding access to an extra dose that could bolster the fight against the Omicron variant.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration permitted the additional doses to be given at least five months after the adolescents received their second shot. The agency also cleared boosters for certain children with compromised immune systems age 5 to 11.
Health authorities have been urging people to get a booster, citing early research indicating it is needed to maintain strong..."
"The Supreme Court in two cases Monday ruled police officers were entitled to protection from being sued over their use of force against suspects.
The unsigned opinions, posted in the court’s periodic list of orders, both overturned lower appellate decisions.
One case involved an officer accused of excessive force when he put his knee on a man’s back during an arrest, while trying to remove a knife from the man’s pocket. In the other case, two officers were sued by the estate of a man whom they shot and killed after..."
"The future of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is expected to take center stage at Tuesday’s confirmation hearing for William Barr, who has signaled that as attorney general he would let the probe run its course in an effort to allay Democrats’ concerns that he might curtail it at the behest of President Trump."
"Two members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, were indicted Friday on federal charges for conspiring to obstruct law enforcement from protecting the U.S. Capitol during the pro-Trump siege on Jan. 6, the Department of Justice announced.
The state of play: Dominic Pezzola, 43, and William Pepe, 31, removed temporary metal barricades erected by the Capitol Police to control access to the Capitol, and stole property belonging to Capitol Police officers, per the indictment."
"WASHINGTON—President Trump used a “Social Media Summit” at the White House Thursday to bond with some of his most provocative supporters over shared grievances against large technology companies whose representatives weren’t invited.
Mr. Trump attacked social-media companies he says are trying to silence individuals and groups with right-leaning views, without presenting specific evidence. He said he was directing his administration to “explore all legislative and regulatory solutions to protect free speech and the free speech of all Americans.”
“Big Tech must not censor the voices of the American people,” Mr...."
"Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) and his Republican opponent, former football star Herschel Walker, faced off on Friday night for their first and likely only debate, using the face-to-face meeting to make their cases to voters just a few weeks before Election Day.
The debate came amid a hectic final push by the two candidates to win over the moderate and swing voters who could very well decide which party will control the Senate. While most polls show Warnock with a narrow lead over Walker, neither candidate is scoring the majority..."
"HONG KONG—Police fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters besieging the city’s government headquarters, as tens of thousands took to the streets in defiance of a police ban on antigovernment demonstrations.
Violence flared in the Admiralty area late Saturday afternoon after crowds occupied major roads in processions that stretched for miles through the city. In other districts, people of all ages held umbrellas in drizzling rain, chanting for freedom as social unrest stretched into a 13th weekend.
By about 5:30 p.m., police fired multiple volleys of tear gas..."
"A federal judge ruled on Monday that Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) coronavirus orders, which shut down the state, closed businesses and limited gatherings, were unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV, a Trump appointee, said in his opinion that COVID-19 orders from Wolf and Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine violated and continue to violate the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly and the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment.
The efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus “were undertaken with the good..."
"The post-pandemic job market boom continues. That's the takeaway from the March numbers, out this morning.
Why it matters: After a year of labor shortages and high inflation, Americans are going back to work in massive numbers. And they're getting paid more — though not enough to raise new inflation alarms.
At first glance, the 431,000 jobs added in March look like a deceleration from the job growth totals for January and February — a revised 504,000 and 750,000 jobs added, respectively.
But employers still added more jobs in March than all..."
"Wildfires are raging in the west of the United States as the region is hit by a heatwave that has brought record temperatures to several areas.

On Saturday, two firefighters in Arizona died when their aircraft crashed while responding to a blaze.
Meanwhile, Las Vegas, Nevada, matched its all-time temperature high of 47.2C (117F) on Saturday.

"The fracking boom made America the world’s biggest oil producer a few years ago, but the U.S. still imports millions of barrels each day from other parts of the world, including Russia.
In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some in Congress have urged the Biden administration to come down swiftly on U.S. imports of Russian crude, going so far as to recommend banning the cargoes.
Here is a look at why the U.S. still imports Russian crude and where it goes."
"After days of lying-in-state, the body of the late Queen Elizabeth II is making its final journey as part of a grand state funeral. It travelled first to Westminster Abbey, for a religious service in front of a congregation of thousands, and then to Windsor Castle for a more intimate committal service and, finally, a private burial.
It is a day of emotion, pomp and ceremony the like of which has not been seen since the last state funeral, of Winston Churchill, almost 60 years ago. The Queen made personal..."
"Two U.S. senators, a Republican and a Democrat, asked Congress on Monday to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, as Republican-controlled state legislatures pass measures imposing new curbs on voting.
Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Lisa Murkowski noted in a letter that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices, was last reauthorized in 2006 with a bipartisan Senate vote of 98-0.
The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, saying that Section 4, the formula used to determine which..."
"The weekend leading up to summer's last holiday is here. On Monday, many companies will observe Labor Day by giving employees a day off. The holiday also signals the fashion rule to stop wearing white until spring. But the long weekend is about more than style, sleeping in and barbecues. Did you know that Labor Day has contentious beginnings? In fact, two men with almost the same name fight for credit.
Before you fire up the grill, enjoy summer's final fanfare and maybe even do some shopping for sales this weekend,..."
"In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, no governor in America moved faster to close down schools, restrict businesses and order his own constituents into a long and painful lockdown than did California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).
Newsom’s steps, at times taken ahead of public health advice issued by the Trump administration, poured gasoline on what had been a sleepy and uninspired effort to recall the governor, firing up a fierce anger that has now forced Newsom to defend himself in a pricey fight to save his political career. More than..."
"Attorney General William Barr, the head of the Department of Justice, will leave office before Christmas, President Donald Trump said Monday.
The widely anticipated announcement of Barr’s departure came just moments after President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over Trump was formalized by the Electoral College. The shake-up, in the twilight of Trump’s tenure in the White House, also followed weeks of public clashes between Barr and the president.
But Barr’s resignation letter, shared on Twitter by Trump as he made the announcement, elaborately praised the president and said he felt “proud..."
"The organizers of this summer’s Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics decided on Saturday that the games will be staged without overseas spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic, the games’ organizing committee said.

"Canada should introduce a total ban on the buying and selling of all handguns, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said.
His government is proposing a new law that would freeze private ownership of all short-barrelled firearms.
The legislation would not ban the ownership of handguns outright - but would make it illegal to buy them.
Mr Trudeau's proposal comes days after a deadly shooting at a Texas primary school, in the neighbouring US, killed 21 people.
The bill, which was presented to Canada's parliament on Monday, makes it impossible to..."

"Texas Health and Human Services released updated statistics Monday showing the number of abortions reported in the state decreased almost 60% in the first month after new restrictions went into effect.
The state reported 2,197 induced terminations of pregnancies for September of 2021, following 5,404 in August, the last month before Senate Bill 8 took effect. Notably, in September there were only two induced abortions performed after six weeks of gestation, which the new law allows only under medical exemptions.

"White House officials have promoted a declaration supporting herd immunity that has reportedly been signed by fake names, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
In a Monday phone call, White House officials cited the Great Barrington Declaration, which argues that the government should push for herd immunity with more infections among the healthy population, according to two senior administration officials.
Supporters of the declaration use it to argue against lockdowns and more reopenings during the pandemic.
“Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public..."

"President Trump is planning on “Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again” with an executive order that would make a classical style the default for federal buildings in Washington and other parts of the country, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The draft order would encourage Greek and Roman architectural designs instead of modern architecture. The order is expected to go in front of Trump next month, a person familiar with the development told the Times.
“Classical and traditional architectural styles have proven their ability to inspire such respect for our system..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is pushing back against the emerging push to abolish the filibuster, saying that Democrats should consider retooling their ""half-baked proposals"" if they're frustrated by long-standing Senate tradition.
""A Democratic assault on the legislative filibuster would make the nomination fights look like child’s play,"" McConnell wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Thursday about the rule that requires 60 votes for the Senate to end debate on a bill.
""That’s because systematically filibustering nominees was not an old tradition but a modern..."
"The California Democrat will announce his candidacy on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" on Monday night.
The show tweeted out a video clip of Swalwell making the announcement after speaking on what he considers to be some of the problems in the current administration.
“I see a country in quicksand, unable to solve problems and threats from abroad, unable to make life better for people here at home,” Swalwell told Colbert.
“I’m ready to solve these problems. I’m running for president of the United States.” Swalwell added. “Boy, did..."
"Democrats in Congress have their work cut out for them this fall. They were able to cut a deal with Republican lawmakers to avert a government shutdown, but when it comes to passing the rest of President Biden’s agenda, including both an ambitious $3.5 trillion spending plan and a bipartisan infrastructure deal, Democrats have much to sort out. It’s still too early to say how much jeopardy either bill is in — assessing Democratic intraparty divisions is difficult — but the fact that Senate Republicans have said they’ll refuse to help raise the debt ceiling creates a real legislative challenge..."
"C-SPAN said the Twitter account of the moderator for the second debate, C-SPAN journalist Steve Scully, was hacked, and that this accounts for a tweet in which he appeared to asked staunch Trump critic Anthony Scaramucci for advice on how to respond to the president.
C-SPAN said Scully believes his account was hacked and that he did not send the tweet about Scaramucci."
"Fireworks of red and gold faded to give way to 2,008 performers beating the fou – an ancient percussion instrument – while chanting excerpts from Confucius’ Analects.
It was the night of August 8, 2008, the opening ceremony for China’s first Olympic Games. Beijing was not only eager to flaunt China’s rich history and culture but also its brand new stadiums, its ability to run an international event smoothly and its talented athletes who went on to win more gold medals than any other nation."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence hinted at a 2024 presidential run on Wednesday night after declining to say whether he'd vote for former President Trump.
Driving the news: A student asked Pence after he delivered a speech at a Georgetown University event hosted by the conservative Young America’s Foundation whether he'd vote for Trump in 2024 if he's the Republican nominee.
""There might be somebody else I'd prefer more,"" he replied. ""What I can tell you is I have every confidence that the Republican Party is going to sort out leadership.""
The intrigue: ""All my focus has..."
"The New York Times and The Epoch Times are in a bit of a public fight.
It started on Oct. 24 when the New York Times published an article about The Epoch Times titled, ""How the Epoch Times Created a Giant Influence Machine.""
The New York Times’ story may bring up some points and criticisms worth considering about The Epoch Times, but its report is also biased and problematic on multiple counts. Overall, the piece, which is not labeled as opinion or analysis but is presented as a news report,..."
"President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the Supreme Court and Republicans are clueless about the power of American women as he signed a second executive order aimed at protecting abortion rights.
The order asks the federal health department to consider allowing Medicaid funds to be used to help facilitate out of state travel for abortions. Like Biden’s first order signed in July, it is meant to address the recent Supreme Court decision to end the nationwide constitutional right to abortion.
It is expected to have limited impact, as Republicans in..."
"The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday will formally charge ex-President Donald Trump with inciting insurrection in a fiery speech to his followers before this month’s deadly attack on the Capitol, signaling the start of his second impeachment trial.
Nine House Democrats who will serve as prosecutors will proceed through the building where hundreds of Trump supporters fought with police, leaving five dead, at about 7 p.m. on Monday (0000 GMT), carrying the article of impeachment to the Senate where Trump will face trial.
A similar ceremony was carried out..."
"Senior U.S. officials knowingly lied to the public about their progress throughout the 18-year war in Afghanistan, consistently painting a rosier picture of the state of the war than they knew to be true, according to a cache of documents obtained by the Washington Post.
In private interviews conducted by a watchdog that span the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations – which the Post obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request -- U.S. officials frequently acknowledged a lack of understanding, strategy and progress in a war they regularly described..."
"Four states will hold primary elections Tuesday, deciding candidates in key Senate and gubernatorial races this fall.
Here are the major races in each state.
Former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch faces businessman Tim Michels for the Republican nomination for governor. Michels is endorsed by Donald Trump, mainly because of a photo posted in 2019 by Kleefisch showing her daughter with Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Brian Hagedorn’s son. Trump opposes Hagedorn because of his vote to reject legal claims filed by Trump challenging the 2020 election results. The winner will..."
"Civil discourse starts with listening. It is tempting to jump in to be sure that the other person knows what you think and feel, but when everyone is trying to be heard, no one is listening. It’s not possible to discuss across divides without listening first, and that starts with me. And when the other person sees that you are truly listening, they will start listening too."

"More than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained health coverage since several of the Affordable Care Act's provisions took effect, according to an Obama administration report released Monday, a week before the law's five-year anniversary.
This includes 14.1 million adults who gained health insurance from the beginning of open enrollment in October 2013 to the beginning of this month. It also includes 2.3 million young adults ages 19-25 who gained coverage between 2010 and the beginning of open enrollment because of the provision allowing them to remain on their parents'..."
"The US Supreme Court’s reversal of the constitutional right to an abortion has handed an instant challenge to business leaders, caught between their fear of reprisals for taking sides on a polarising topic and their employees’ dependence on company-issued health insurance.
“The ultimate result is chaos for employers that typically operate in multiple states,” given the expectation that many states will now pass sweeping abortion bans, said Jen Stark, co-director of the centre for business and social justice at BSR, which advises businesses on how to navigate their social responsibilities...."
"Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson on Monday vetoed a bill that would have made the state the first in the country to prevent doctors from providing certain types of care to transgender youth.
But his veto could be overridden by a simple majority vote in the Arkansas Senate and House, which passed the bill with sizeable majorities.
At least 16 other states are considering similar legislation, which transgender advocates have attacked, saying that cutting off badly needed care to adolescents would inevitably lead to more suicides. Civil rights organizations have also..."
"Government, news and social media websites across the globe were coming back online Tuesday after being hit by a widespread outage linked to U.S.-based cloud company Fastly Inc(FSLY.N).
High traffic sites including Reddit, Amazon, CNN, Paypal, Spotify, Al Jazeera Media Network and the New York Times were all listed as experiencing problems by outage tracking website Downdetector.com, but appeared to be coming back up after outages that ranged from a few minutes to around an hour.
Fastly, one of the world's most widely-used cloud based content delivery network providers, said..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday he and President Trump should not go ahead with next week's presidential debate if Trump still has COVID-19.
Biden, who clashed with Trump at a chaotic first debate last week, told reporters at an airport in Hagerstown, Md., that the pair's second scheduled faceoff should follow protocols from health officials.
The former vice president said he will ultimately be guided by the Cleveland Clinic, which is overseeing health conditions for all presidential and vice presidential debates this year."
"More than 100 pages of emails released by the White House on Wednesday depict a protracted, frustrating and often tense debate about what should be contained in public ""talking points"" about last year's deadly assault in Benghazi, Libya.
The emails reveal a tussle within the administration about what it could confidently say about the attacks while an investigation into the assault was ongoing.
Senior administration officials said the emails—which the White House released to try to quell a partisan controversy—encompassed a two-day discussion among several agencies as officials wrote and..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden was caught on a hot mic cursing a Fox News reporter at a White House event on Monday after the journalist shouted a question about the impact of rising inflation on this year's congressional elections.
As journalists were ushered out of a meeting of Biden's Competition Council, Peter Doocy, a White House correspondent with whom Biden regularly spars, asked if it was OK to ask about inflation and if it was a political liability.
""That's a great asset, more inflation,"" Biden responded sarcastically over a din..."
"Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday called for changes to a religious-freedom bill passed by the state’s legislature, after it sparked an outcry akin to the one that followed a similar law in Indiana from groups and companies who say it could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians.
Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked lawmakers to recall the bill at a news conference Wednesday morning, saying that its language must make clea"
"A few months ago, when gas was a mere $3 or so a gallon, stickers started showing up on gas pumps that showed President Joe Biden pointing to the price. The stickers read “I did that!” and they were a sort of guerrilla warfare against the Biden administration and its policies.
The stickers may be showing up with greater frequency now as sanctions against Russia settle in, including the ban of Russian oil, which the president announced Tuesday.
Although Russian oil comprises about 3% of the crude the U.S. imports, prices are..."
"The Trump administration rejected guidelines proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to take public health precautions to safely reopen the economy, according to The New York Times.
The guidelines drafted were meant to instruct how schools, restaurants, churches and other establishments can safely reopen.
They include using disposable dishes and utensils at restaurants, closing every other row of seats in buses and trains while restricting transit routes to areas experiencing high levels of coronavirus infection.
They also recommend separating children at school and camps..."
"Ticket-splitters are poised to play a pivotal role in a handful of key battleground states, like Pennsylvania and Georgia, where signs are growing that voters may be willing to cross party lines for certain candidates. 
In Georgia, where voters will choose their next governor and U.S. senator next week, polling has routinely shown Gov. Brian Kemp leading his Democratic rival Stacey Abrams by distinct margins, while Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) has maintained a narrow edge over Herschel Walker, the Republican Senate nominee. 
A similar dynamic is playing out in Pennsylvania, where Democrat Josh Shapiro has opened up a..."
"President Trump on Tuesday night threatened to veto a defense bill if it does not include the repeal of a legal shield for internet companies, throwing down the latest gauntlet in a fight over a piece of must-pass legislation.
Trump’s warning took aim at Section 230, which gives tech companies protections for third-party content posted on their platforms and allows them to make ""good faith"" efforts to moderate content. The president and other Republicans have claimed that social media firms use the law to unfairly censor conservatives.
“Section 230,..."
"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is asking the Justice Department inspector general to investigate new documents that indicate members of former special counsel Robert Mueller's team erased some records from their official phones.
""These reports are troubling and raise concerns about record retention and transparency,"" Johnson wrote in a letter to Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz. ""Therefore, I respectfully request that your office open an investigation into this matter to determine what, why, and how information was wiped, whether any..."
"If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade and paves the way for states to implement abortion bans, the U.S. would join only three countries — El Salvador, Nicaragua and Poland — that have rolled back abortion rights since 1994, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The big picture: Nearly 60 countries have liberalized their abortion laws — though some only incrementally — over the last 25 years.
The rollback of abortion rights has come in countries ""where democracies have eroded,"" says Margaret Harpin, a legal adviser at the Center for Reproductive

"It's one of the main drivers of U.S. inflation reaching a 40-year high, and among the factors most likely to hurt Democrats’ electoral chances in the November midterms.
It’s high gasoline prices, and President Joe Biden is starting to get creative in trying to lower them. 
U.S. gas prices currently average $4.27 per gallon, a sharp decline after a mid-March high that caused drivers to put in fewer miles on the road, sending demand for gas plummeting. But the national average is still well over $1 more per gallon relative to a year ago, and the current..."
"Hurricane Ian, now a Category 1 storm, made landfall again on Friday, striking South Carolina as Florida continues to reel from its impact.

"President Biden revealed in vivid display this week the thinking animating his 100-day plan: Do not allow outside events to take his eye off the make-or-break imperatives of virus eradication and economic growth.
The big picture: He dispatched Vice President Harris to handle the brewing crisis at the border. And, in yesterday's press conference, he made plain gun control and other topics may need to wait.
On gun control: ""It's a matter of timing.""
""[S]uccessful presidents — better than me — have been successful, in large part, because they..."
"President Biden shared a fist bump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after arriving in the Gulf kingdom for a high-stakes visit.
Why it matters: Biden once vowed to make the kingdom a ""pariah,"" and U.S.-Saudi relations have been strained over a number of issues, including the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
U.S. intelligence concluded MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder — an allegation Saudi Arabia denies.
State of play: Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia is aimed at recalibrating U.S. relations with the Gulf kingdom.
It will include a bilateral meeting with..."
"Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook restricting a story about Joe Biden's son during the 2020 election was based on FBI misinformation warnings.
The New York Post alleged leaked emails from Hunter Biden's laptop showed the then vice-president was helping his son's business dealings in Ukraine.
Facebook and Twitter restricted sharing of the article, before reversing course amid allegations of censorship.
Zuckerberg said that getting the decision wrong ""sucks"".
""When we take down something that we're not supposed to, that's the worst,"" Zuckerberg said in a rare extended media interview on the..."
"Former President Trump leads President Biden by 1 point in a hypothetical rematch, according to a New York Times-Siena College poll published Monday.
Trump leads Biden, 45 to 44 percent, when likely voters were asked whom they would support if the 2024 presidential election were held today.
That’s roughly in line with previous polling showing Trump leading Biden, Vice President Harris and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in hypothetical match-ups.
Other polls have been more favorable for Biden, including a Yahoo News-YouGov poll last month that had Biden leading Trump by 6 points.
Last week, Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper..."

"The U.S. and COVID-19 are settling into a long, but hopefully manageable future together.
The big picture: The worst of the pandemic is likely behind us, but the virus is here to stay. We’re entering a new phase — one in which the country’s overall experience with this virus will be less like having a heart attack, and more like managing a lifelong chronic condition.
Experts have been saying for a long time that there’s almost no chance COVID-19 would disappear. Rather, they’ve been expecting it to become endemic — meaning it..."
"The United States might be nearing the end of the pandemic phase of the coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Scott Gottlieb said over the weekend.
Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said during “Face the Nation” on CBS News over the weekend that the U.S. is “close” to the end of the pandemic.
“I think that we’re close to the end of the pandemic phase of this virus, and we’re going to enter a more endemic phase and as things improve, cases may pick up,” Gottlieb said.
COVID-19 numbers may start to trend upward..."
"RESEARCHERS AROUND THE world are toiling to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. But the creation of a working vaccine that can be safely distributed to a broad population requires a tremendous amount of rigor and caution, so the process is likely to take at least a year. WIRED staff writer Megan Molteni has covered the novel coronavirus outbreak since the virus was first identified in early January. This week on Gadget Lab, we talk with Megan about where our efforts to make a vaccine currently stand. We also discuss..."
"Republicans in competitive House and Senate districts are hitting Democrats with a barrage of ads focused on voters’ increased fears about the surge in violent crime in recent years, with the issue playing a central role in many tight races.
Republicans have called Democrats too tolerant of crime after social-justice protests in 2020 swept through the country over policing abuses, and have criticized some Democrats’ support of measures such as eliminating cash bail. They also have tied Democratic candidates to calls from activists to defund police departments and shift money to other resources. 
Democrats..."
"As Major League Baseball reportedly prepares to present players with its plan on opening the 2020 season, one group of players with a particular eye on the league’s health policies are those with immunodeficiencies or other underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
However, in a report by The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal on Monday, players known to have such conditions appear ready to put their faith in MLB’s doctors and medical personnel and play ball with the rest of the players.
Rosenthal and ESPN’s Jeff Passan..."
"This weekend, Americans will change their clocks and lose an hour of sleep, all because of a senseless and outdated government policy. Changing between daylight saving time and standard time isn't just an inconvenience to people everywhere — it has real repercussions for Americans' health, economy and public safety.
We can't always get bipartisan agreement in Congress these days, but here's one thing we can agree on: we could all use a bit more sunshine. That's why we're working together in the US Senate to make sure we end the..."
"American intelligence indicates Iran was the staging ground for a debilitating attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, people familiar with the discussions said Monday, as Washington and the kingdom weighed how to respond.
The assessment, which the U.S. hasn’t shared publicly, comes as President Trump raised the prospect of a joint U.S.-Saudi retaliatory strike on Iran, a scenario that risks quickly broadening into a regional armed conflict.
U.S. officials shared with Saudi Arabia the images, intelligence reports, and their assessment that Iran launched more than 20 drones and at least..."
"The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released its long-awaited Russia interference report detailing significant contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow during the 2016 election.
The fifth and final volume, just shy of 1,000 pages, lays out the counterintelligence threats and vulnerabilities that were exposed through Russian contacts and a willingness by some members of the Trump campaign to accept foreign assistance.
Its release comes more than a year after former special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his 22-month investigation in which he did not find evidence to charge any..."
"Priorities USA Action, a deep-pocketed “super PAC” with close ties to President Barack Obama, has thrown its weight behind a possible presidential bid by Hillary Clinton, in a major symbolic move that could discourage rivals.
The group also named Mr. Obama’s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, as its co-chair, fueling speculation that the President was tacitly endorsing Mrs. Clinton over his own vice president, Joe Biden."
"U.S. border agents encountered 100,441 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, Troy Miller, the senior official performing duties as the commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said on Wednesday, confirming the highest monthly total since a major border surge in mid-2019.
Miller said more than 19,000 of those encounters were families, close to 9,500 were unaccompanied minors and the remainder adults. Border officials said they also count repeat crossers in their numbers."
"U.S. presidents have little control over the price that consumers pay for gasoline. As the Energy Information Administration explains, gasoline prices are mainly affected by the price of crude oil, a fossil fuel that is refined into gasoline. And the price of crude oil is set on the global market, based largely on worldwide supply and demand. 
When economic activity declined sharply in the U.S. and other countries early in the COVID-19 pandemic, global demand for crude oil declined along with it, leading to a dramatic drop in the price of crude oil and gasoline, and, consequently,..."
"Twenty-one U.S. states reported weekly increases in new cases of COVID-19, with Arizona, Utah and New Mexico all posting rises of 40% or higher for the week ended June 7 compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis.

In Arizona, Monday’s certified election results showed that Mr. Biden won Arizona’s 11 electoral votes with a popular-vote margin..."
"Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton put rival Bernie Sanders on the defensive Sunday over health care and gun control, in a series of sharp exchanges during their final debate before voting for the presidential nominations begins in Iowa.
Mrs. Clinton argued Mr. Sanders has been weak on gun restrictions and that his health-care plan would be a mistake because it would require starting over after a long, contentious national debate on the issue. Mr. Sanders, w"
"While many people around the world coped with the Facebook and Instagram outage by making lighthearted jokes on Twitter, the incident had more serious consequences for WhatsApp users in Latin America.
Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are now back online after millions were unable to access the social media sites or messaging app for several hours on Monday. The company said the issue was down to a faulty configuration change.

"New applications for unemployment benefits edged higher last week but stayed very low, reflecting an unusually tight labor market as the economy continued to recover.
Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, inched up by 18,000 to 206,000 for the week ended Dec. 11 from a revised 188,000—the lowest level in 52 years—the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday. New jobless claims have been steadily declining throughout the year.

"Without explicitly addressing their prior coverage, Fox News and Newsmax both aired segments over the past few days walking back a subset of election fraud claims centering around voting machines manufacturer Smartmatic, which earlier this month delivered legal notices to a trio of conservative networks for promoting baseless conspiracy theories about the company."
"A Justice Department official stepped down from his role overseeing probes into voting crimes hours after Attorney General William Barr announced on Monday that he had authorized the agency to investigate any ""substantial allegations"" of voter fraud in the presidential election.
In an email first obtained by The New York Times, Richard Pilger wrote to colleagues, “Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications ... I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch.”
Pilger added in the email that the..."
"Nearly four dozen Democrats joined House Republicans to pass legislation Thursday that would halt the resettlement of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the U.S. and overhaul the screening process, delivering a rebuke to the White House in response to public anxiety sparked by last Friday’s Islamic State attacks in Paris.

"Promising new clinical data for an experimental COVID-19 treatment hints at a secondary but possibly more important takeaway for investors: if this neutralizing antibody treatment works in coronavirus patients, so will the vaccines that are in development.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, +1.49% on Tuesday shared preliminary data from a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial for REGN-COV2, finding that the investigational therapy reduced viral load and made symptoms go away sooner in some non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19.

"Luke Hutchison woke up in the middle of the night with chills and a fever after taking the Covid-19 booster shot in Moderna’s vaccine trial. Another coronavirus vaccine trial participant, testing Pfizer’s candidate, similarly woke up with chills, shaking so hard he cracked a tooth after taking the second dose.
High fever, body aches, bad headaches and exhaustion are just some of the symptoms five participants in two of the leading coronavirus vaccine trials say they felt after receiving the shots.

Haaland, an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo, earned bipartisan support to run the Interior department, which has a staff of 70,000 employees and is charged with overseeing the country’s natural resources. The agency manages nearly 500 million acres of land, or one-fifth of..."
"In a federal trial set to begin here on Monday, abortion-rights supporters are seeking to strike down a new provision of a state law that will require abortion clinics to qualify as ""ambulatory surgical centers"" starting next month, saying it will force even more of the state's facilities to close.
Since Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed a hotly contested law in July 2013 requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, the number of licensed Texas clinics providing abortions has declined by half over the past year, to..."

"Three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory.
The details of the reporting go beyond a State Department fact sheet, issued during the final days of the Trump administration, which said that several researchers at the lab, a center for the study of coronaviruses and other pathogens, became sick in autumn 2019..."

"In the past few days, President Trump and some of his fellow conservatives have changed the way they refer to the virus that has caused nearly 10,000 deaths around the world. For more than two months, Trump used the word “coronavirus.” On Monday, he began calling it the “Chinese virus” on Twitter and in public briefings. Other GOP lawmakers and conservative media figures have pivoted their language as well, with some preferring “Wuhan virus,” referring to the area of China where the outbreak originated.
The change in word choice has..."
"A federal court on Monday dismissed the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust complaint against Facebook, as well as a parallel case brought by 48 state attorneys general, dealing a major setback for the agency’s complaint that could have resulted in Facebook divesting Instagram and WhatsApp.
Shares of Facebook rose more than 4% on Monday following the rulings, sending the social media company’s market capitalization above $1 trillion for the first time.
The FTC sued the company last December, alongside attorneys general from 48 states, arguing that Facebook engaged engaged in a systematic strategy to eliminate threats to its monopoly, including the 2012..."
"The Affordable Care Act seems likely to withstand its third challenge at the Supreme Court.
During arguments in a case seeking to eliminate Obamacare, several of the court’s conservatives on Tuesday expressed an unwillingness to strike down the landmark legislation.
Chief Justice John Roberts, who cast the key vote in 2012 upholding Obamacare, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, an appointee of President Donald Trump, suggested that the court may cast aside a challenged provision of the law, known as the individual mandate, while leaving the rest of it standing."
"Former President Donald Trump said Monday evening that FBI agents were conducting a raid at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.
“Nothing like this has ever happened to a president of the United States before,” he said in a statement. “After working and cooperating with the relevant government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate.”
Details of the operation were not immediately available.
Aides to Mr. Trump didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for..."
"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) office is under scrutiny after a complaint filed with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) alleged groups with ties to her chief of staff failed to properly disclose payments.
The freshman congresswoman denied to Fox News on Tuesday that any violation took place after the National Legal and Policy Center, a Virginia-based conservative watchdog group, filed a complaint with the FEC a day earlier alleging Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, ""orchestrated an extensive operation to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign spending..."
"Hillary Clinton has said in a speech that her husband and the ex-President, Bill Clinton, will have a job revitalising the American economy. Which is an interesting thought really, for it certainly would be both fun and interesting if we could have a rerun of the growth of the 1990s. Far more interesting than that would be what economic policy might be if and when Bill was put in charge of revitalising that economy. First off I guess we’d need to bring Brad Delong back to Treasury to deregulate Wall..."
"More than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities on Tuesday closed campus or cancelled classes due to bomb threats on the first day of Black History Month.
The big picture: It was the second day this week and third in the last month that several HBCUs received such threats. By Tuesday afternoon, the majority of the schools had been cleared and no bombs had been found.
The FBI said it was aware of the threats and was working with local law enforcement."
"Life expectancy in the United States fell by a year in the first half of 2020 - the biggest decline since World War 2 - and stood at the lowest levels since 2006, according to estimates issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday.
While the estimates are provisional, and do not reflect the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC said it was publishing provisional data for the first time in order to assess the effect of excess deaths in 2020.

"Gov. Ron DeSantis is going head-to-head with Disney.
What's happening: DeSantis added an agenda item to the Legislature's special session on redistricting this week, asking legislators to repeal the law that allows the Walt Disney World Resort to operate as a self-governing body.
DeSantis announced the move Tuesday at a news conference in The Villages.
Flashback: After pressure from employees and fans, Disney stopped political donations in Florida and vowed to help repeal the recently signed Parental Rights in Education law, dubbed ""Don't Say Gay"" by critics.
At the bill's signing, DeSantis said that no matter what kind of..."
"On Sunday, the kind of news no one wants to see slid across the landscape. There was a shooting at a church in White Settlement outside of Fort Worth, and there were casualties. But as we delved into the details, we will admit feeling first a sense of relief that the loss of life was not larger — two innocent lives were lost along with the assailant — and then a sense of gratitude.
Our gratitude, which was also felt by Gov. Greg Abbott, comes from the knowledge that this..."
"A federal judge magistrate said Thursday he is not prepared to find that the affidavit into the search of former President Donald Trump's Palm Beach home should be fully sealed.
There are portions of it that, at least presumptively, could be unsealed, U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart said at a hearing in West Palm Beach. Whether those unsealed portions will be relevant to the media will be for someone else to decide, he said.
“I’m going to move forward in that way,"" Reinhart told attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice and various media agencies,..."
"In one of the final decisions of its current term, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the National Collegiate Athletic Association in a closely watched case, concluding that the NCAA could not prevent certain payments to college athletes, thus putting the longstanding amateur model of college sports in jeopardy.
After the ruling was announced, Trey Wingo, a former ESPN host and commentator, sent a tweet that sought to encapsulate how stunning the Supreme Court’s 9-0 decision was.
“A 9-0 Supreme Court ruling is the equivalent of finding a unicorn and..."
"President Biden’s push for a gas tax suspension amid soaring fuel prices is receiving a cool reception among Democrats on Capitol Hill.
Party leadership did not commit to taking up a gas tax moratorium, which requires an act of Congress, and the caucus remains largely divided on the issue. 
But, even if Democrats were unified, pausing the tax would face an uphill battle in the Senate because of Republican opposition. 
Biden on Wednesday officially endorsed the idea of a gas tax holiday – calling on Congress to suspend the 18-cent tax..."
"Roman Catholic bishops in the U.S. elected José H. Gomez, the archbishop of Los Angeles, as president of their joint organization on Tuesday, making him the first Latino ever to hold the position.
Archbishop Gomez has served as the vice president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for the past three years. His elevation from that position to president is customary for the group. The archdiocese of Los Angeles is home to the largest number of Catholics in the nation.

"New Year’s Eve has arrived, but ringing in 2021 will look different from when everyone rang in 2020.
This time around, many will be celebrating in their own homes with those in their household. With COVID-19 cases on the rise, going out to parties or bars might not be on the table.
Just because you can’t go anywhere, doesn’t mean you can’t partake in the usual traditions of NYE, or even add some new ones to your annual celebration."
"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday ruled out the Biden administration playing any role in a ""vaccine passport"" system as Republican governors in particular balk at the concept.
""The government is not now, nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential,"" Psaki told reporters at a briefing.
The White House has been clear that it would defer to private companies if they wanted..."
"Ukraine has pushed Russian forces to abandon the Snake Island, a small but strategic outpost in the Black Sea, the Operation Command South said on June 30. 
According to the Ukrainian military, ""the enemy hastily evacuated the remnants of the garrison in two speedboats and probably left the island.""
Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed its forces had left the island. However, it called the withdrawal ""a gesture of goodwill"" rather than a defeat, adding that the troops ""had completed their mission"" and were withdrawing to demonstrate Russia's willingness to allow for grain exports..."
"U.S. President Donald Trump used the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday to attack China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying it must be held accountable for having “unleashed this plague onto the world.”
By contrast, China’s President Xi Jinping struck a conciliatory tone in his pre-recorded virtual address to the General Assembly, calling for enhanced cooperation over the pandemic and stressing that China had no intention of fighting “either a Cold War or a hot war with any country.”
The leaders of the world’s two largest economies laid out their..."
"The White House said Monday afternoon it was ready to respond immediately to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would sign an executive order that will “prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine.”"
"As the Republican Convention opens I expect President Trump will make the case he is best positioned to end the recession. According to Yale professor Ray Fair’s predictive voting model, the incumbent party usually wins if the economy does better in the year of the election. Unfortunately for the Republican party, Trump may have sunk his reelection because he ignored advice from professional economists.
Trump ignored economists who advised him that corporate tax cuts would not be enough to induce investment or induce firms to raise pay. Trump ignored economists’..."
"Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said Saturday that he believes the Supreme Court was ""clearly wrong"" when it decided in a historic 2015 ruling that same-sex marriage was legal under the Constitution.
Obergefell v. Hodges, a landmark LGBTQ rights case, was decided in a 5 to 4 ruling in June 2015. The Supreme Court decision made it illegal for any state, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories to deny a marriage certificate to same-sex couples, citing the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the..."
"Major leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines that run from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea have generated plenty of theories but few clear answers about who or what caused the damage.
Here is what we know and what has been said so far:
WHO IS BEING BLAMED?
So far, Western governments and officials have avoided pointing a finger directly, while Russia has blamed the West.
European Union states say they believe the damage was caused by sabotage but have stopped short of naming anyone...."
"New coronavirus infections in the U.S. fell by 25% over the past two weeks — another hopeful sign that the worst of the Delta wave may be behind us.
By the numbers: The U.S. is now averaging roughly 114,000 new cases per day. That's still a lot, but it's a significant improvement from this summer, when the Delta variant unleashed a new wave of infections, hospitalizations and death.
Deaths are still on the rise nationwide, because of that summer surge. They're up 4% over the past two weeks, to an average..."
"The U.S. Capitol Police turned down offers for support from the National Guard and the FBI to help manage what ended up becoming a massive Capitol security breach carried out by a mob of pro-Trump supporters.
Capitol Police were contacted by the Pentagon three days before the planned event to see if they needed assistance from the National Guard, The Associated Press reports. Then as the rioters fell upon the Capitol, leaders from the Justice Department reached out to see if they needed assistance from FBI agents. Sources close to..."
"The Supreme Court of the United States on Friday rejected a bid launched by Texas and backed by President Donald Trump that sought to challenge President-elect Joe Biden’s election wins in the key swing states of Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
The nation’s highest court rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit, assessing that the motion lacked grounds to sue, known as “standing,” under Article III of the Constitution.
“Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending..."
"President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday led a national memorial observance on the eve of his inauguration to honor the 400,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19 during the 11 months since the novel coronavirus claimed its first U.S. victim.
The sundown commemoration came just hours before President Donald Trump was due to leave the White House and hand over a country in crisis. The ceremony, spearheaded by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris from the base of the Lincoln Memorial, marked the federal government’s first official nod to the staggering..."
"A key gauge of U.S. inflation rose a sharp 1% in June, led by higher fuel prices, in a sign that price pressures in the economy are still intense and unlikely to relent quickly.
The increase in the so-called personal-consumption price index exceeded Wall Street’s forecast. Economists had predicted a 0.9% advance.
A narrower measure of inflation that omits volatile food and energy costs, known as the core PCE, rose by 0.6% . That was above Wall Street’s 0.5% forecast.
The rate of inflation over the past year climbed to 6.8%..."
"The EPA on Monday announced landmark new vehicle emission standards likely to serve as a centerpiece of the Biden administration’s climate agenda, even as Democrats' struggles to pass a budget reconciliation package create challenges for the auto industry to comply with the new standards.
Administrator Michael S. Regan announced the standards during an event in the EPA courtyard, flanked by several electric vehicles and joined by clean air advocates. Regan said the agency is responding to scientific evidence that calls for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions fueling climate change.
“That's..."
"A federal appeals court on Friday reinstated the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for businesses with at least 100 workers.
Why it matters: The administration paused enforcement of the mandate, which requires companies to ensure their workers are fully vaccinated or tested weekly by Jan. 4, 2022, after a separate federal circuit court last month deemed it ""staggeringly overbroad.""
Republican attorneys general, private companies and some industry groups sued to challenge the requirement and the Justice Department asked that the cases be consolidated.
What they're saying: A three-judge panel on 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati..."
"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during an overnight raid led by U.S. military forces in Syria, a further blow to a jihadist group that once held a swathe of territory in Iraq and Syria.
Where once they confronted armies, the extremist Islamist group’s adherents have in recent years staged hit-and-run raids and suicide attacks. In some cases, the group has claimed responsibility for atrocities such as bombings in Sri Lanka in April that killed more than 250 people...."
"The parents of a Michigan teen accused of killing four high-school classmates each pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter at an arraignment Saturday morning, hours after the couple was arrested in Detroit following a manhunt.
A judge set bond for James and Jennifer Crumbley, appearing at Saturday’s hearing from separate cinderblock-lined rooms via video, at $500,000. Each count carries a potential prison sentence of up to 15 years. Criminal charges against parents or other family members following a shooting committed by a minor at a school or elsewhere are..."
"Negotiations for an infrastructure package took center stage on Sunday as the clock ticks for the White House and Senate Republicans to strike a bipartisan deal on a trillion-dollar package.
The administration and Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), have traded infrastructure proposals in recent weeks as debate swirls about what should be included in the package, the total price tag and how the investments should be paid for.
A main sticking point is what Democrats have dubbed “human infrastructure,” which includes investments in long-term care for seniors and people with..."
"Iran said it would exceed limits on its enriched-uranium stockpiles before the end of this month, days after the U.S. accused Tehran of orchestrating a second set of attacks on tankers near a vital global-shipping route.
If it carries through the threat, Iran would breach the enriched-uranium cap set in the 2015 nuclear deal, jeopardizing European efforts to save a pact that President Donald Trump withdrew from last year. Iran warned in early May it would withdraw from parts of the nuclear deal in retaliation, but its Monday announcement after..."
"Rudy Giuliani has been named a target of a Fulton County, Ga., investigation into efforts by then-President Donald Trump and his supporters to overturn the 2020 election in the state, one of his lawyers said Monday.
Robert Costello, an attorney for Mr. Giuliani, said prosecutors told Mr. Giuliani’s legal team that their client is a target of the investigation. Mr. Giuliani, a onetime personal lawyer for Mr. Trump, was a prominent supporter of efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential election result. Mr. Giuliani was subpoenaed in the probe earlier this summer.
A spokesman for the office..."
"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he has declassified all documents related to federal investigations into Russian election interference and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server for government emails.
“I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax. Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!” Trump wrote on Twitter."
"Nearly a year and a half since Covid-19 was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how the virus first emerged remains a mystery.
But in recent weeks the controversial claim that the pandemic might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory - once dismissed by many as a fringe conspiracy theory - has been gaining traction.
Now, US President Joe Biden has announced an urgent investigation that will look into the theory as a possible origin of the disease.
So what do we know about the competing theories..."
"Police in Springfield, Missouri, said they arrested a man who showed up at a Walmart store carrying a rifle and wearing body armor, terrifying shoppers who fled from the store.
Springfield police posted on Facebook that ""an armed individual"" was arrested Thursday. No shots were fired.

"The House voted to impeach President Trump for an unprecedented second time on Wednesday, alleging he encouraged a mob to storm Congress as part of a last-gasp effort to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s election win.
The vote was 232 to 197, with all Democrats joined by 10 Republicans, in a House chamber guarded by National Guard troops stationed throughout the Capitol and its grounds.
Democrats’ push to impeach Mr. Trump just before he is set to leave office reflects many lawmakers’ deep anger at Mr. Trump’s monthslong campaign to challenge..."
"As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed 80,000, with new outbreaks in Italy and Iran and a worsening situation in South Korea, stock markets plummeted amid analysts' fears that the health emergency might spark a global recession.
But others cautioned that the risk of recession is low and China will likely contain the new coronavirus by the end of March, staving off an economic crisis. Moreover, the internet is helping offset some of the economic damage.

"With 100 days to go until the midterm election, unexpectedly strong bids by several Republican candidates and President Barack Obama's continued sagging approval ratings are boosting GOP chances of capturing a Senate majority.
A battery of recent polling shows Republican candidates mounting competitive bids for at least 10 Senate seats now held by Democrats, including in Iowa and Colorado, states that have been leaning Democratic in recent years. Many Republican candidates have narrowed their opponents' fundraising advantage, according to the latest campaign-finance reports. And a series of international crises has..."
"A federal judge on Thursday denied the Justice Department’s motion to access the classified records stored at Mar-a-Lago and installed a recently retired judge to serve as the special master former President Trump requested.
The duo of orders from federal district Judge Aileen Cannon will ignite a Department of Justice (DOJ) appeal to the 11th Circuit and also selects Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as the special master — the one candidate both the DOJ and Trump’s legal team could agree on.
The order requires Dearie to complete his review by Nov...."
"Former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who governed Brazil between 2003 and 2010, came close to winning his old job back in an outright victory in the country’s presidential election on Sunday, as voters expressed their rejection of incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.

Abbott also said that effective March 10, every business will be allowed to open at 100 percent capacity.
""Make no mistake, COVID has not suddenly disappeared. COVID still exists in..."
"Control of the U.S. House is up for grabs on election night and the simple math favors Republicans. It’s not just polling. Democrats are defending more seats in tough districts than Republicans are.
Only a small handful of really competitive races, of which there are dozens, need to flip from blue to red for the GOP to control the House.
Democrats’ current majority in the House sits at just five seats.
It’s a historically small margin which, according to the polls, Democrats are expected to lose this Tuesday.

"U.S. consumer price growth slowed sharply in April as gasoline eased off record highs, suggesting inflation has probably peaked, though it is likely to stay hot for a while and keep the Federal Reserve's foot on the brakes to cool demand.
That aspect was reinforced by the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, which also showed underlying monthly inflation pressures building up again after a lull in March as airline ticket prices notched their biggest increase on record. Rents rose by the most since 2006, further squeezing consumers who..."
"WASHINGTON — New Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Friday he has no plans to restore mailboxes and other agency cuts made since he took over in June, sparking fresh questions over how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of an expected surge of mail-in ballots for the November election.
It was DeJoy’s first time publicly answering questions since summer mail delays brought a public outcry. Testifying before a Senate committee, the ally of President Donald Trump said “it was his “sacred duty” that ballots arrive on time. But he..."

"Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday said they had asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to authorize booster shots of their COVID-19 vaccine for all adults 18 and over, seeking to broaden who is eligible for a third shot.
The move comes as part of a long-running debate among experts over who should be eligible for booster shots. An FDA advisory panel voted against a request for all adults to have a booster in September, in what was a blow to the Biden administration's earlier announcement of widespread shots.
But the..."
"The deadly riot that took place at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, drew widespread attention and condemnation from the American public. But Democrats and Republicans differed sharply over key aspects of it, both in its immediate aftermath and in the months that followed.
A year later, here’s a look back at how Americans saw the events of Jan. 6 and how some partisan divisions grew wider over time. All findings in this analysis are based on Pew Research Center surveys conducted in January, March and September of last year.
Americans expressed shock, horror..."
"Democrats were enjoying a stronger-than-expected showing in the U.S. midterm elections early on Wednesday, as it appeared the party was limiting its losses in the U.S. House of Representatives and capturing important governors' races.
But as votes were still being counted in several states, there remained the possibility that Republicans could end up with control of both the House and the U.S. Senate.
Here are some takeaways from the election so far:

"As millions of California students head back to school this month, they’ll get a bit more time before their alarms go off. The most populous state in the country is also the first to mandate start times in public schools – an effort to allow teens much-needed winks. Middle schools can start no earlier than 8 a.m., and high schools no earlier than 8:30 a.m.  
The law is based on studies that show teenagers aren’t getting enough sleep – and that their health and performance improve when they do. 
The American Academy..."
"Nearly 900,000 workers applied for jobless benefits last week, extending recent increases in another sign the economy is entering a winter slowdown.
Unemployment claims rose to 885,000 from 862,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said Thursday.
More broadly, claims are down sharply from a peak of nearly 7 million in March, but the four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, recently increased after trending downward since the spring. The weekly figures can be volatile around the holidays due to seasonal-adjustment issues.
“The next few months will be pretty..."
"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday announced that it is siding with a district court ruling that found the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.
The move is an escalation of the Trump administration's legal battle against the health care law.
The DOJ previously argued in court that the law's pre-existing condition protections should be struck down. Now, the administration argues the entire law should be invalidated."
"On Jan. 9, The Post reported that then-President Donald Trump, in a call with Georgia’s lead elections investigator, Frances Watson, had instructed her to “find the fraud.” He mentioned that she could become a “national hero,” reported the newspaper.
In both cases, the quotes were wrong, as The Post has acknowledged in a correction to the story. “Trump did not tell the investigator to ‘find the fraud’ or say she would be ‘a national hero’ if she did so. Instead, Trump urged the investigator to scrutinize ballots in Fulton County,..."
"Protesters are pushing to “defund the police"" over the death of George Floyd and other black Americans killed by law enforcement. Their chant has become rallying cry – and a stick for President Donald Trump to use on Democrats as he portrays them as soft on crime.
But what does “defund the police” mean? It’s not necessarily about gutting police department budgets."
"Former President Trump has sued CNN in federal court in Florida for defamation.
In the lawsuit filed Monday, Trump’s attorneys claim CNN “has sought to use its massive influence — purportedly as a ‘trusted’ news source — to defame the Plaintiff in the minds of its viewers and readers for the purpose of defeating him politically, culminating in CNN claiming credit for ‘[getting] Trump out’ in the 2020 presidential election.”
The former president is seeking $475 million in punitive damages, according to the lawsuit.
Trump announced his intent to sue the network earlier this summer, saying..."
"A federal court in West Palm Beach on Friday unsealed more documents tied to the FBI's unprecedented Aug. 8 search of former President Donald Trump's Florida home, after media outlets asked for the records to be made public.
The unsealing by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon came one day after she heard oral arguments by Trump's attorneys and the Justice Department's top two counterintelligence prosecutors over whether she should appoint a special master to conduct a privilege review of the seized materials at Trump's request.
Cannon deferred ruling immediately on..."
"With today’s reporting that Justice Stephen Breyer intends to retire, we now kick off our analysis of potential nominees to replace him. President Joe Biden previously promised to nominate a Black woman, and we assume he will keep that commitment. Two potential nominees therefore stand apart from all others: Leondra Kruger, a justice on the California Supreme Court, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Both are well known to the White House team that will lead the nomination process. Kruger is a..."
"Food and Drug Administration regulators said Friday that the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children far outweigh the risks for children ages 5 to 11.
Why it matters: The announcement could add momentum to the FDA's authorization of doses for children on an emergency basis, which could happen as early as next week, according to the New York Times.
Driving the news: The remarks came on the same day that the FDA released data showing the Pfizer vaccine had a 90.7% efficacy rate in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in a trial of 5- to 11-year-olds.

"The House Select Committee investigating the events of January 6, 2021 may soon seek testimony from former Vice President Mike Pence, according to Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger.
Pence's potential testimony could shed light on issues surrounding the former vice president's interaction with the Secret Service during the Capitol riot and in particular suggestions that Pence believed there was a coup attempt.
Kinzinger, one of two Republicans sitting on the committee, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the select committee is considering asking Pence to appear before them for an interview.

"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said about 1,500 Americans remain in Afghanistan and are waiting to be evacuated. 
The Biden administration has been engaged in a furious effort to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies before Aug. 31, the deadline set for a complete exit from the country. 
Blinken said the U.S. has evacuated 82,300 people, including 4,500 people with U.S. passports, since Aug. 14, the day before the Taliban took Kabul and completed its takeover of Afghanistan.  "
"President Barack Obama escalated a public feud over international trade with the liberal wing of his own party, a brawl that threatens to undermine one of the key goals for the White House this year.
The schism over trade widened with several testy exchanges this week between Mr. Obama and his liberal base, including remarks Friday in which the president said critics were mischaracterizing the deal."
"Some people on Twitter are convinced that a Kanye West presidential run is a plot to help President Donald Trump defeat his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
Those commenters are theorizing that Kanye would be more likely to draw votes from the Democrat in the race, Biden, although, of course, who knows if West is even serious? “The amount of people I see actually considering Kanye is scary, every vote that isn’t for Biden is a vote for Trump,” wrote one concerned Twitter user."
"A shooting at a mall in Greenwood, Indiana, on Sunday evening has left at least four people dead, including the suspected gunman — who police say was shot by an armed bystander.
The latest: Authorities said a 12-year-old girl was among two people wounded after the shooter opened fire with a long gun at the mall, south of Indianapolis. Her injuries were minor, Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers said in a statement.
Greenwood Police Chief Jim Ison said a news conference late Sunday that the girl was taken to a local hospital as a precaution..."
"Even those with high-priority access to water are at risk of having their spigots turned off. As holders of some of the oldest water rights in California, many farmers and ranchers here in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta have never had their spigots turned off, a fate many of their counterparts in the parched state have endured.
But under an order from the State Water Resources Control Board, the local Byron Bethany Irrigation District last month shut down irrigation to more than 160 farmers and ranchers in its 30,000-acre area."
" The United States on Wednesday announced it would impose a new slate of sanctions on Russia that includes first-time sanctions on the two adult daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Katerina Tikhonova and Mariya Putina, who are in their 30s, are rarely seen in public and almost never mentioned by their father. The Kremlin has only ever identified them by their first names.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to end the use of Title 42, a pandemic-era public health policy used by both the Trump and Biden administrations to rapidly expel migrants at the border, by late May, according to multiple reports.
Why it matters: U.S. officials have been bracing for the policy's end, which could fuel already rising numbers at the border. The government has readied a sweeping contingency plan, preparing for a worst-case scenario of up to 18,000 migrants being taken into custody each day, Homeland Security officials told reporters Tuesday.
What they're saying: The..."
"A spokesman said he was moved on the advice of his medical team and was receiving ""excellent care"".
Mr Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise ""where necessary"", the spokesman added.
The prime minister, 55, was admitted to hospital in London with ""persistent symptoms"" on Sunday evening.
The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson's health by No 10, according to Buckingham Palace.
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care.
However, he..."
"House Republicans re-elected John Boehner (R., Ohio) for a third term as House speaker on Tuesday over the objections of a band of frustrated conservatives lobbying for a new leader.
Mr. Boehner, 65 years old, faced more opposition from his party’s right flank than in years past, but not enough to oust him from the House’s top post. After being selected among House Republicans for the post in November, he was officially re-elected in a floor roll-call vote, as the new Congress—now fully controlled by Republicans—convened on Tuesday."
"Twitter will attach warning labels to posts that contain misleading information about coronavirus vaccines and introduce a strike system for repeat offenders, the tech giant announced Monday, as the company tries to combat the circulation of misinformation. Twitter employees will initially be charged with labeling posts they determine violate Twitter policy, and their decisions will be used to teach Twitter’s automated tools to identify and label similar content across the platform, according to the company.
The labels may link curated content, like Twitter Moments, or links to trusted sources for..."
"The House of Representatives gave final approval on Wednesday to one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history, a sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill that gives President Joe Biden his first major victory in office.
The measure provides $400 billion for $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and increased funding for vaccine distribution.
Approval in the Democratic-controlled chamber came without any Republican support after weeks of partisan debate and wrangling in..."
"Consumer spending tumbled a record 16.4% in April as the backbone of the U.S. economy retrenched amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a government report Friday.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected the advanced retail sales number to fall 12.3% after March’s reported 8.3% dive already had set a record for data going back to 1992. The March numbers were revised to be not as bad as the 8.7% initially reported.
Some 68% of the nation’s $21.5 trillion economy comes from personal consumption expenditures, which tumbled 7.6% in the first..."
"The numbers: Sales at U.S. retailers sank a record 16.4% in April after coronavirus lockdowns shuttered much of the economy, cost millions of jobs and spawned an unprecedented slump in consumer spending.
Retail sales tumbled in every category except online shopping, the government said Friday. Sales also sank by a revised 8.3% in March, easily marking the worst back-to-back declines in modern American history.
Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a 12.5% plunge.
What happened: Receipts at auto dealers fell more than 12% as sales fell to the lowest level in..."
"Ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials began on the Belarusian border on Monday as Russia faced deepening economic isolation four days after invading Ukraine.
Russian forces seized two small cities in southeastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency said.
But they ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two failed to make as much ground as some had expected.
Talks began with the aim of an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian..."
"Former US Vice-President Joe Biden has reversed his stance on abortion funding amid mounting criticism from his fellow 2020 Democratic rivals.
At a Democratic gala on Thursday, Mr Biden denounced a law which restricts federal abortion funding, saying he believed all healthcare was a right.
The party's current front-runner added that he made ""no apologies"" for having backed it previously.
Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke had been the latest to attack his stance.
Mr Biden had long voiced support for the Hyde Amendment - a law passed in 1976, right..."
"A federal appeals court on Thursday intervened to temporarily block the National Archives from handing over Trump administration records to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol ahead of a Friday deadline.
A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction keeping the records from being turned over to allow former President Trump to continue his legal challenge. 
""The purpose of this administrative injunction is to protect the court’s jurisdiction to address [Trump's] claims of executive privilege and should not be construed in any..."
"Federal prosecutors investigating former President Donald Trump asked a judge Monday not to unseal a key document related to the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, saying it contains “highly sensitive information” that could compromise the national security probe.
The government’s request came three days after the federal judge made public the search warrant and other materials that outlined some key details of the raid on the former president’s Palm Beach, Florida, resort home.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said last week that he personally approved the warrant, and that he supported its disclosure in..."
"The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Thursday that political partisan gerrymandering cases present a question that courts cannot decide.
The justices made the ruling in a pair of cases presented over district maps in Maryland and North Carolina, alleged to be instances of unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court's majority opinion that federal courts cannot consider such challenges.
The opinion vacates previous rulings on the district maps in Maryland and North Carolina, and requests that the cases be dismissed ""for lack of jurisdiction.""
The split..."
"President Biden will request $37 billion in the annual budget to go towards supporting law enforcement and for crime prevention, the White House announced on Thursday. 
The request will be part of Fiscal 2023 budget process and Biden is set to announce it in remarks on Thursday in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The trip will be focused on building on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was the bipartisan gun bill he signed into law last month. 
Senior administration officials said the timing of the announcement is a way for the president to stress..."
"When I was 19, I had surgery for sex reassignment, or what is now called gender affirmation surgery. The callow young man who was obsessed with transitioning to womanhood could not have imagined reaching middle age. But now I’m closer to 50, keeping a watchful eye on my 401(k), and dieting and exercising in the hope that I’ll have a healthy retirement.
In terms of my priorities and interests today, that younger incarnation of myself might as well have been a different person — yet that was the person who committed..."
"Freshman GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw (Texas) took aim at Sen. Tammy Duckworth Wednesday, questioning the Illinois Democrat’s patriotism after she suggested that there should be a ""national dialogue"" about whether to remove statues and monuments of the founding fathers.
Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, was discussing voter outreach to veterans during a Trump campaign “MAGA meetup” event on Thursday when he took a swing at Duckworth, a combat veteran who lost both her legs serving in Iraq, accusing her of supporting the “destruction of America,” The Washington Post first reported."
"That’s Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, firing back in a tweet at Fox News host Tucker Carlson, after he slammed her as a “deeply silly and unimpressive person” on his show Monday.
Carlson also counted Duckworth, who lost her legs while flying a U.S. Army helicopter in Iraq in 2004, among those who “actually hate America” because she supports a “national dialogue” about whether monuments should be removed and military bases renamed as the country re-examines its history.
“You’re not supposed to criticize Tammy Duckworth in any way because..."
"The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions to punish Russia for what it described as Moscow’s attempt to poison opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent last year, in President Joe Biden’s most direct challenge yet to the Kremlin.
The announcement of action against seven Russian officials and 14 entities made by senior Biden administration officials marked a sharp departure from former President Donald Trump’s reluctance to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny, 44, fell ill on a flight in Siberia in August and was airlifted to Germany, where..."
"South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, easily won the Republican nomination to seek reelection in November, while a former member of Trump's cabinet was locked in a tight race in his Montana primary for the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday.
Noem, known for her opposition to COVID-19 restrictions, won her primary with 77% of the vote, while former Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke of Montana was locked in a tight race as he seeks the party's nomination to return to Congress.
At..."
"The U.S. government won an appeal in its bid to extradite Julian Assange, clearing an important hurdle in Washington’s yearslong battle to put the WikiLeaks founder on trial on spying charges.
The decision by the U.K. High Court to overturn a lower-court ruling isn’t the end of the case. Lawyers representing Mr. Assange said they would seek permission to appeal the ruling at the U.K. Supreme Court, setting the stage for weeks or even months of further legal wrangling, lawyers say.
In their ruling, Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett and Lord Justice..."
"It’s one thing for campaign strategists to dream up a divide-states-and-conquer plan on a conference call. It’s quite another for actual voters to agree. Ted Cruz and John Kasich have struck a non-aggression pact in an attempt to block Donald Trump from winning the GOP presidential nomination. Is that a fair way to play politics?
The answer to that question depends heavily on what one thinks about the role parties and their organizations should play in today’s American democracy...."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawmaker walking U.S. senators methodically through the case for removing President Donald Trump from office is also becoming Exhibit A in efforts by the president’s allies to defend him.
Over the first three days of Trump’s impeachment trial, the head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, has led a team of Democratic lawmakers serving as prosecutors as they lay out their evidence that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender...."
"Watching the rapid deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan—the Taliban have captured a third of the country’s provincial capitals in the weeks since the U.S. military pulled its troops out—has evoked a feeling of déjà vu for me.
In 2005, I was an adviser to an Iraqi infantry battalion conducting counterinsurgency operations in and around Baghdad, one of the most violent parts of Iraq during one of the most violent periods in that conflict. It was difficult to have any hope at the time. I returned to Iraq in 2009,..."
"A report from the US Crisis Monitor found that 93% of protests associated with the Black Lives Matter movement have been peaceful, despite a highly polarized political climate and reports on the news emphasizing instances of destruction, looting and overall lawlessness.
The report analyzed recent protests spurred by the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, and it also analyzed differences between the data and public opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement."
"Federal Judge Dabney Friedrich struck down on Wednesday the national eviction moratorium, potentially leaving millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has banned most evictions across the country since September. President Joe Biden has since extended that protection to renters until July.
Some 1 in 5 renters across the U.S. are behind on their payments amid the pandemic, and states are scrambling to disburse more than $45 billion in rental assistance."
"The state of Texas sued the Biden administration Tuesday seeking to reinstate a Trump-era policy that forced migrants arriving at the southern border to wait in Mexico while applying for asylum.
President Biden in his first days in office directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a replacement for the policy known as ""Remain in Mexico"" that forced more than 60,000 asylum-seekers south across the border.
“The result of this arbitrary and capricious decision has been a huge surge of Central American migrants, including thousands of unaccompanied minors,..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that temporarily blocks some foreigners outside the United States from obtaining U.S. permanent residency, a move he said would protect American workers amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
The executive order included a number of exemptions and was not a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.
Here is what Trump’s order does and does not do."
"They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for ""continuous, direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents"".
A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezos's data.
The kingdom's US embassy has denied the ""absurd"" story.
But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated."
"President Biden said during a CNN interview broadcast Tuesday night ""a very slight recession"" is possible for the U.S., but he doesn't think it will happen.
Why it matters: With fewer than 30 days until the midterm elections, Biden and the Democrats have a shrinking window of time to assure Americans that the economy remains healthy.
Driving the news: In their interview, CNN's Jake Tapper asked Biden: ""Should the American people prepare for a recession?""
Biden initially responded with a firm ""no,"" but he later clarified: ""I don't think there will be a recession. If..."
"Battling for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were locked in a tight race for Iowa’s delegates and the momentum that comes with a win in the nation’s first contest.
Mrs. Clinton maintained a narrow lead through much of the night, but with 93% of precincts reporting, her advantage was just 49.8% of the delegates versus 49.6"
"As our nation celebrates Veterans Day, my fellow veterans and I will no doubt hear multiple times “Thank you for your service” in brief conversations and in the form of a free cup of coffee or 20 percent off a meal. These well-meaning expressions of gratitude sometimes make us feel awkward and unsure of how to respond. “You’re welcome” seems too short, yet “Ah shucks, I was just doing what anyone would” seems a bit much. 
Despite the slight twinge of self-consciousness, we are of course deeply grateful for the..."
"It has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May, marking victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.
Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.
This year, the event has taken on a significance of its..."
"President Trump has denied paying North Korea money for the medical care of comatose US student Otto Warmbier.
Warmbier was jailed in North Korea in 2015 during an organised tour and died after being returned to the US in a coma after 17 months in detention.
Earlier reports said that the US had been billed $2m (£1.5m) for the student's medical care.
North Korea had allegedly demanded the bill be paid before he was allowed to return home.
Mr Trump denied the claim on Twitter on Friday. He wrote: ""No..."
"Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Democrat Beto O'Rourke won their parties' gubernatorial nominations on Tuesday, as the state's first-in-the-nation primary contests kicked off the race to the Nov. 8 general election.
Abbott, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, easily turned back several right-wing challengers. He is favored to beat O'Rourke, who is seeking to become the first Democratic governor of Texas in nearly three decades.
Texas voters were also selecting their parties' nominees on Tuesday for the U.S. House of Representatives. The results could offer clues about..."
"Despite all the noise from both sides of the debate, when you run the numbers, it turns out that Donald Trump could win the nomination on the first ballot precisely because of the GOP’s delegate rules. Ted Cruz also benefits, but not until later ballots. The losers? John Kasich and all the other candidates, and their supporters."
"Minneapolis voters on Tuesday rejected a ballot measure to overhaul the city's police department by replacing it with a new agency.
Why it matters: The result — in the city where George Floyd was murdered by a police officer a year and a half ago — is a significant blow to the police reform movement's momentum in Minneapolis and beyond.
State of play: Returns Tuesday night showed Question 2 failing by a double-digit margin, 56% to 43%
Details: The measure called for replacing MPD with a new Department of Public Safety that ""employs..."
"President Biden told reporters Thursday that his ""sense"" is that Russia will invade Ukraine ""within the next several days,"" as troops and supplies continue to arrive at the border and international monitors report shelling across the line of contact in eastern Ukraine.
The latest: ""Every indication that we have is that they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,"" Biden said, warning that the risk is ""very high."" He added that there is still a ""path to diplomacy,"" but that he has no plans to reach out to Russian President..."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence signaled that he is open to a 2024 presidential run against former President Donald Trump during an interview with the New York Times published on Monday.
Why it matters: A run would mark a definitive turn in the relationship between Pence and Trump, though the growing rift between them has been evident for some time, with Pence disputing Trump's claims that he could have overturned the 2020 election.
Back in March, Trump admitted the two had not spoken for a ""long time.""
What they're saying: “We’ll go where we’re called,” Pence..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that lawmakers would resume the count of electoral votes to confirm the November election result once the U.S. Capitol is cleared after pro-Trump rioters breached the building.
She said that decision was made after consultations with fellow congressional leaders and calls to the Pentagon, Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence."
"U.S. Attorney General William Barr faces tough questioning on Tuesday by a Democratic-controlled House of Representative committee whose members believe he abused his power to bolster President Donald Trump’s allies and silence his political enemies.
The hearing’s start was delayed after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler was involved in a car collision, CNN reported, citing sources. CNN said Nadler was not injured and had not been driving.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the collision, but a Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the hearing’s start would be delayed.
The hearing will..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the brutal home invasion attack on her husband last month will affect her decision on whether to remain in the Democratic leadership in Congress.
But Pelosi, D-Calif., who police say was the actual intended target of the man charged in the attack, did not reveal in a new CNN interview whether that means she will leave her leadership post or stay in it.
Pelosi, 82, has been the top House Democrat for two decades.
Pelosi’s comment came as her party is battling to remain in..."
"US President, Donald Trump has announced that Sudan and Israel have agreed to the normalization of relations.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was taking steps to normalize ties with Sudan, calling it the start of ""a new era"" in the region.
""Today we announce another dramatic breakthrough towards peace,"" he said. ""Today Khartoum says yes to peace with Israel, yes to acknowledging Israel and yes to normalization with Israel. This is a new era, an era of true peace."""
"The latest data tells many economists that the U.S. labor market is moving sideways. U.S. employers hired in September at nearly the same modest pace as the prior month. The economy added 156,000 jobs last month, compared with a revised 167,000 in August. The jobless rate rose a tick to 5%, but wages also improved. Here’s how economists and analysts reacted to Friday’s report.
“A blah September jobs report gives no impetus for anything on the economy’s to-do list: There’s no sign of an overheating economy that would justify a..."
"A final tally announced by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger showed that Mr Biden won the normally Republican stronghold by under 12,000 votes.
The state carried out a second recount of the 3 November vote following challenges from President Trump's team.
Mr Raffensperger, a Republican, warned that debunked claims about voting fraud were ""hurting our state"".
President Trump continues to refuse to accept defeat in the vote, alleging, without evidence, there has been widespread fraud.
""We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,"" Mr..."
"A declassified version of a U.S. intelligence report expected to be released on Thursday finds that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, four U.S. officials familiar with the matter said.
The officials said the report, for which the CIA was the main contributor, assessed that the crown prince approved and likely ordered the murder of Khashoggi, whose Washington Post column had criticized the crown prince’s policies.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Donald Trump five weeks ago, told reporters..."
"Rents and other shelter costs are emerging as a major driver of overall consumer inflation, keeping it high at a time when many other sources are starting to ease.
Economists expect housing inflation to strengthen further before cooling off in the coming months, but are unsure of when relief will appear. This creates another challenge for the Federal Reserve as it raises interest rates to reduce price pressures.
Overall annual inflation eased to 8.3% in August from 8.5% in July, according to the Labor Department’s consumer-price index. That reflected declines from the month before in prices for items such..."
"The White House on Friday waved off any concerns about President Biden's well-being after he stumbled twice on the stairs when boarding Air Force One for a trip to Georgia, with aides saying the president is ""doing 100 percent.""
Biden slipped while jogging up the steps to the presidential aircraft on Friday morning. When he caught his footing, he stumbled again, dropping to a knee and taking a moment to collect himself before continuing to the plane.
""I know folks have seen that President Biden slipped on his way up..."
"The student government president at the University of Florida is facing a call for his impeachment over his role in bringing Donald Trump Jr. and Trump campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle to campus for a speaking engagement last month.
The Washington Post reports Michael Murphy, the school's student president, was served with a formal impeachment resolution from the student government and accused of malfeasance and abuse of power.
Those who are backing the impeachment contend that emails show the speaking engagement for Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle last month, which cost $50,000,..."
"President Barack Obama on Tuesday night declared an end to the U.S. economic crisis as he made the case to Americans, and a skeptical Congress, that now was the time to focus on resolving the most stubborn impediment to a full-fledged recovery: lagging progress among the middle class.
“The shadow of crisis has passed,” Mr. Obama said in his annual State of the Union address, arguing that a revitalized economy should guide Washington leaders to confront what he called “middle-class economics.” Laying o"
"The Trump campaign’s effort to change the outcome of the presidential election increasingly is moving from a legal setting to the court of public opinion, where the campaign continues to sow doubt about the contest's integrity and hopes to win over public officials with a role in certifying the results.
The shift in focus coincides with the appointment of Rudy Giuliani to head the campaign’s legal effort. The former New York mayor's strategy reportedly entails a longshot bid to pressure Republican lawmakers in key battleground states to approve pro-Trump electors..."
"The Biden administration notified governors and mayors on Wednesday of the number of Afghan evacuees their state is expected to receive in the coming weeks, two senior administration officials told Axios.
Why it matters: Although their exact immigration pathway is still unclear, an initial group of 37,000 Afghans will soon be headed to states across the country after many faced harrowing journeys from Afghanistan.
Former Delaware Gov. Jack Markell (D), who President Biden appointed on Friday to oversee Afghan resettlement, made calls to state and local leaders notifying them on the number of Afghans to..."
"The West is facing a profound series of decisions on Ukraine. Despite President Biden’s videoconference with Russian President Putin and agreement to have their teams “follow up” on diplomacy, the threat remains from Russia’s extensive and threatening military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. Maintaining Ukraine’s sovereignty and democracy is a critical challenge demanding an effective response. An appropriate military component needs to be part of that response in the event diplomacy fails.
Russia’s actions and the prospect for conflict have received widespread condemnation from the United States and its allies. Biden has engaged in extensive..."
"The first drug promising to slow the memory-robbing march of Alzheimer’s disease was approved by U.S. health regulators, a watershed after years of research and billions of dollars in investment.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved the drug, which has the molecular name aducanumab and will be sold as Aduhelm, based on evidence it reduces a sticky substance in the brain called amyloid that is associated with Alzheimer’s.
The drug’s sale offers hope to millions of people dealing with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers, given the lack of good options..."
"A poor response to the coronavirus could be politically devastating for President Trump, and so far his administration has given the strong impression that it’s still scrambling as the risk of a pandemic mounts.
Why it matters: There’s only so much any president can do to stop a virus from spreading, and for now the coronavirus is still very much under control within the U.S. But if the disease get worse in the months ahead, and if the administration seems to be caught off guard, that spells trouble for public..."
"President Biden on Wednesday dismissed members of his own party who have been critical of Israel, telling an Israeli news station that those progressive lawmakers are “wrong.”
Biden sat for an interview with N12 News in Israel and was asked about Democrats who have called Israel an “apartheid state” and called for an end to unconditional aid for Israel.
“There are few of them. I think they’re wrong. I think they’re making a mistake,” Biden said. “Israel is a democracy. Israel is our ally. Israel is a friend, and I think..."
"Bari Weiss, a high-profile editor and writer for the New York Times opinion section, resigned Monday, citing what she said was unchecked bullying from colleagues and depicting the news organization as a place where the free exchange of ideas was no longer welcome.
In a letter to New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger which was posted on her website Tuesday, Ms. Weiss wrote that she has been “the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views.”"
"President Donald Trump called into “Fox & Friends” a day after the impeachment hearings ended and repeated false statements that have been debunked by fact-checkers and, in some cases, members of his own administration.
Trump repeated the baseless theory that the Democratic National Committee gave its computer server to a “Ukrainian company.” In fact, the DNC hired U.S.-based company CrowdStrike to investigate the cyberattack on its network during the 2016 elections, and CrowdStrike said it has “never taken physical possession of any DNC servers.”
Trump continued to push the false..."
"The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee moved to intensify its investigation of Republican President Donald Trump on Thursday, as lawmakers edged closer to deciding whether to recommend his impeachment.
The 41-member panel met to debate a resolution allowing it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings, subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning and quicken the pace of an investigation that is expanding into areas that could prove politically explosive for both Trump and Congress.
Committee members also hope that approving the resolution will dispel lingering confusion within the House..."
"The House took a first step Tuesday toward preventing a possible default on U.S. debt.
The chamber passed a bill that would allow the Senate to raise the country’s borrowing limit with a simple majority vote. Lawmakers attached the provision to legislation that would prevent automatic Medicare cuts set to take place at the end of the year.
The measure will head to the Senate. It will need 10 Republican votes to pass and go to President Joe Biden’s desk.
Once the president signs the bill, the House and Senate..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci appears to have lost patience with his critics in recent weeks, reacting angrily to criticism of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and suggestions that he has not been honest in his dealings with Congress.
Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), had angry exchanges with senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) at a hearing of the Senate Health Committee on Tuesday and was heard on a hot mic calling Marshall a ""moron.""
On December 21, 2021, Fauci called for the firing of Fox News host Jesse Watters following..."
"The average price for a gallon of unleaded on Tuesday is less than $4 in 11 states, according to AAA, and within a penny of that threshold in another five. 
The states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas -- are almost all in the South. Texas is offering the cheapest, at an average of $3.83 a gallon.
The nationwide average is considerably higher -- $4.33 a gallon -- but still a healthy distance from the all-time high of $5.02, reached on June 14. ..."
"Pelosi weighs delaying delivery of articles of impeachment to Senate until Republicans set trial rules she considers fair.
The morning after the House voted along party lines to impeach President Trump, it was uncertain when and under what procedures the Senate would conduct his trial.
The House on Wednesday approved abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress articles against Mr. Trump in the wake of his pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Nearly all Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), supported the..."
"China's President Xi Jinping met with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit Thursday.
Why it matters: Their first in-person encounter since Russian forces launched their Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine marks a show of diplomatic support for the Russian president after Ukrainian troops forced his forces to retreat from much of Ukraine's northeast, even as Putin acknowledged that Beijing may have ""questions and concerns"" regarding the war.
Xi is aiming to bolster his standing as a geopolitical statesman in..."
"The World Health Organization said Tuesday that it will convene a second emergency meeting next week to decide if monkeypox poses a global health threat as cases rise to 9,200.
The U.N. agency declined last month to declare a global emergency in response to monkeypox. But as infections have risen substantially over the last several weeks, the organization is expected to consider whether to issue its highest alert when the emergency committee reconvenes next week.
“The emergency committee for monkeypox will reconvene next week and look at trends, how effective the countermeasures..."
"Russia has withdrawn its troops from the strategic Ukrainian town of Lyman, in a move seen as a significant setback for its campaign in the east.
The retreat came amid fears thousands of soldiers would be encircled in the town, Russia's defence ministry said.
Recapturing Lyman is of strategic significance for Ukraine.
The town had been used as a logistics hub by Russia, and could give Ukrainian troops access to more territory in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Video footage shared online showed Ukrainian soldiers waving their national flag on..."
"President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he will probably give his Republican presidential nomination speech live from the White House, although the plans have not been confirmed yet.
“We’re thinking about it. We’re thinking about doing it from the White House,” he said in an interview with Fox News. “It’s the easiest alternative.”
Trump cited the security costs of his travel and a convention speech and said holding it at the White House “would be by far the least expensive from the country’s standpoint.”
“I’ll probably do mine live from..."
"President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act in the Oval Office on Thursday, one day earlier than originally scheduled.
Why it matters: The enactment of the massive coronavirus relief plan cements Biden's first major legislative victory and comes exactly one year after the pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization.
The big picture: Federal agencies will now face the daunting task of implementing one of the largest economic relief packages in U.S. history, which is projected to lift millions out of poverty in addition to supporting..."
"Number seeking jobless aid has subsided since initial layoffs surge but is still at historically high levels
Nearly 3 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total number of applications in two months of coronavirus-related disruptions to 36.5 million.
The number of Americans seeking jobless aid is still at historically high levels but has subsided since an initial surge in layoffs drove claims up to a weekly peak of nearly 7 million at the end of March.
“The numbers are very high, but they’re stepping down every..."
"Texas abortion clinics can temporarily resume abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy, following a ruling from a state court blocking the enforcement of pre-Roe laws banning abortion.
The court granted a temporary restraining order Tuesday in response to a lawsuit filed June 27 by the Center for Reproductive Rights and other groups on behalf of several Texas abortion providers. Another hearing is set for July 12.

"President Trump on Tuesday insisted he is not a racist amid sustained criticism of his attacks on four minority, progressive Democratic congresswomen.
The president’s latest defense of his tweets telling the lawmakers to “go back” to their home countries, even though they are all U.S. citizens, came hours before the House is set to vote on a resolution condemning them as racist.

"Democrats are looking into President Trump’s potential obstruction of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe as part of the impeachment inquiry, a House Judiciary Committee counsel told a panel of federal circuit court judges on Monday.
House Democrats have repeatedly pushed for the release of grand jury documents stemming from Mueller’s probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, citing an “urgent need.”
Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee, questioned the continued relevance of the Mueller grand jury testimony and exhibits, given press reports that Democrats are..."
"In 1994, eight years after Americans celebrated the first Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Congress made the annual federal holiday more than just a break from work. The holiday officially became a national day of service. “A day on, not a day off” is the official motto.
Congress tasked the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that helps lead service, volunteering and grant-making efforts, with making the day of service a reality.
Each year, the agency and the King Center in Atlanta join nonprofit organizations, other government..."
"Child killer Salvador Ramos was involved in a shootout with authorities before he entered the school to begin his massacre, but they were unable to stop his rampage, an official revealed.

Nonfarm payrolls for the month grew by 678,000 and the unemployment rate was 3.8%, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
That compared to estimates of 440,000 for payrolls and 3.9% for the jobless rate.
In a sign that inflation could be cooling, wages barely rose for the month, up just 1 cent an hour or 0.03%, compared to estimates for a 0.5% gain. The year-over-year..."
"Weekly initial claims fell by 75,000 after two consecutive increases as economy continues to recover from spring coronavirus shutdowns
New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week after a recent jump, an indication that layoffs are easing but remain high as the labor market continues to recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and related restrictions.
Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell by 75,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 in the week ended Nov. 28, the Labor Department said Thursday. That follows two consecutive..."

"A lawyer for President Trump said that House Democrats’ request for the president’s tax returns flouts constitutional constraints and should be rejected by the Internal Revenue Service.
In a letter to the Treasury Department’s top lawyer, attorney William Consovoy began laying out a legal case that the Trump administration could use to refuse the congressional request. Mr. Consovoy argued there are limits to a 1924 law that requires the IRS to turn over any tax returns sought by Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), chairman of the House’s tax-writing committee.

"US President Joe Biden has warned Russia not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.
Speaking during an interview with CBS News, Mr Biden said such action would ""change the face of war unlike anything since World War Two"".

He told defence chiefs it was because of ""aggressive statements"" by..."
"Democrats are worried that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lagging support among Latino voters could put him at risk of losing Florida, and even the White House, in November.
Recent polls out of Florida show the former vice president’s support among Latinos trailing Hillary Clinton’s in 2016, fueling concerns that he could lose a pivotal swing state.
“There’s really no good answer here if you’re the Biden campaign,” one Florida Democratic operative said. “At this stage in the campaign, he should not be getting these numbers against the most anti-Hispanic..."
"So much for the pollsters. It’s too early to say for sure, but the red wave is starting to look more like a red trickle. While we still need to wait a bit to determine the balance of power in Congress—with quite a few crucial races way too close to call—a related narrative is developing.
It has, thus far, been a pretty good election night for normal Republicans, when compared to the more extreme MAGA Trumpy Republicans.
To be sure, there aren’t a lot of normal Republicans anymore. Most have..."
"Fraudsters likely stole $45.6 billion from the United States' unemployment insurance program during the COVID-19 pandemic by applying tactics like using Social Security numbers of deceased individuals, a federal watchdog said on Thursday.

"Infrastructure negotiations between President Biden and a group of Republicans led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) have officially broken down, and Biden now plans to turn his attention toward striking a deal with a separate, bipartisan group of senators, administration officials said Tuesday night.
What we're hearing: When Biden and Capito spoke by phone on Tuesday, the call only lasted a few minutes, and it was clear that the two sides remain too far apart to find a compromise.
The two parties still hadn't agreed on how to define what..."
"Oct. 12 marks the federal holiday of Columbus Day — or, if you live in jurisdictions like the District of Columbia, Indigenous Peoples Day. The debate over honoring Christopher Columbus as a consequential historical figure, vs. decrying Columbus as a driving force behind the genocide of Native Americans and transatlantic slavery, returned to Philadelphia this year. The city’s Art Commission voted in August to remove the Columbus statue from Marconi Plaza following protests and conflict at the site, including weapon-carrying vigilantes who claimed to be protecting the statue in June...."
"During the White House coronavirus press briefing on April 23, President Donald Trump set off a firestorm of mudslinging and misinformation when he inquired about possibly using disinfectant to treat people with COVID-19.
Fact checkers were all over the place after Trump made the comments, which followed Department of Homeland Security undersecretary William Bryan’s description of recent government tests that found sunlight and disinfectant to be effective in eliminating the virus.
Bottom line: Trump never said that people should inject or drink disinfectant. Headlines, social media posts and news coverage..."

"A judge has ordered President Trump and his children to pay $2 million to a group of nonprofit organizations as part of a settlement with the New York state attorney general's office involving ""persistent"" violations of charities law, reports CNN.
Why it matters: The lawsuit alleges that the Trumps violated state and federal campaign finance laws in 2016 by using the Donald J. Trump Foundation's tax-exempt status ""as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests."" The Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve last December in..."

I also believe we have a cultural obligation to take steps toward slowing down the senseless killing of our children. The debate about gun control has delivered nothing but status quo. It’s time we talk about gun responsibility."

"Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, banked a record $46 billion in collective profits in the second quarter, fueled by the highest energy prices in over a decade and lucrative oil-refining margins.

"The economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter—increasing 7.4% over the prior quarter and at a 33.1% annual rate—recovering about two-thirds of the ground it lost earlier in the coronavirus pandemic.
Gross domestic product—the value of all goods and services produced across the economy—jumped following a record decline from earlier in the pandemic when the virus and related shutdowns disrupted business activity across the country. That puts the economy about 3.5% smaller than at the end of last year, adjusted for inflation and seasonal fluctuations.

"Monday morning, Seth Moulton, the 40-year-old congressman from Massachusetts, officially announced he is running for president on “Good Morning America.” While Moulton might not yet be a household name, he fits neatly into a certain mold of 2020 candidate — the young, ambitious U.S. representatives who feel their time has come. Like Tim Ryan, he has criticized Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s leadership of the party; like Eric Swalwell, he toppled an incumbent to win his seat the first time; and like Tulsi Gabbard, he served in the military. But though he..."
"Conservative House Republicans are pushing for GOP leadership elections to be delayed ahead of closed-door votes next week on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) Speakership bid and other offices. 
It’s still not clear which party will control the House, with nearly three-dozen races without a winner. While the GOP is still favored to win the majority, it is expected to be much smaller than once thought, which has given critics of McCarthy an argument to make against him. 
“We don’t even know if we have the majority or who’s..."
"Respondents are very sure of who they plan to vote for: 45 percent of respondents said they are “absolutely certain” to vote for Biden and 32 percent said the same of Trump. Very few are torn — just 2 percent said they were split 50-50 between Biden and Trump.
However, despite Biden’s commanding lead in the polls and among the respondents in our survey, many remain skeptical that he can win the presidency. Overall, 37 percent of respondents said either Trump or Biden was “absolutely certain” to win, while 16..."

The 40 percent surcharge tax applies to certain high-cost employer health care plans (hence the “Cadillac tax” nickname). It isn’t set to take effect until 2022, and Congress has twice delayed its implementation.
The tax was envisioned as a way to help pay for the 2010 health care law. There’s bipartisan support in both the House and Senate for its repeal, which has been a..."

"A federal judge in Brooklyn on Friday ordered the Trump administration to fully restore the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meaning the government will once more have to accept new applications for the program that protects immigrants living in the U.S. since childhood without legal permission.

"Nebraska on Wednesday became the seventh state since 2007 to scrap the death penalty, the latest sign of weakening support for capital punishment in statehouses across the country.
The move was driven by a bipartisan group of legislators, who argued that the death penalty had grown inefficient and ineffective. Nebraska hadn’t executed anyone since 1997, and until recently had struggled to get the drugs needed to carry out executions.

"Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media on Friday that the ""nuclear weapons issue is a hoax,"" responding to a Washington Post report that FBI agents sought nuclear documents in a search of his Florida home earlier this week.
It was not clear whether such documents were recovered at the Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, the Post said. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. 
The U.S. Justice Department asked a judge on Thursday to make public the warrant that authorized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, after..."
"National Rifle Association members at the group’s annual meeting Friday repeated their opposition to stronger gun-control measures as protesters outraged over the mass shooting at an elementary school four hours away said it was beyond time for action.
The political divide played out on opposite sides of the street in downtown Houston, as NRA members lined up to hear speeches from former President Donald Trump and other gun-rights advocates, while protesters at an adjacent park said the massacre of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, demanded new solutions.

"NIAID director Anthony Fauci warned Wednesday that large gatherings this holiday season are unsafe even for fully vaccinated people who've had a COVID-19 booster shot, as the Omicron variant surges across the U.S.
What he's saying: ""There are many of these parties that have 30, 40, 50 people in which you do not know the vaccination status of individuals,"" Fauci said at a briefing. ""Those are the kind of functions in the context of Omicron that you do not want to go to.""
Fully vaccinated families should be safe to attend smaller gatherings, Fauci..."
"The U.S. Senate on Friday evening voted down consideration of additional witnesses in President Trump’s impeachment trial. The chamber is now very likely to vote to acquit Trump, although it’s not clear if that vote will happen in the next 24-48 hours or sometime next week.
The vote, 51-49 against witnesses, was mostly along party lines. Just two Republican senators, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, joined the 47 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in favor of hearing from witnesses. The other 51 Republicans opposed the..."

Why it matters: It's one of the largest capital raises for a Latina-owned and operated startup in the U.S.

"President Joe Biden addressed the country Thursday night from Philadelphia with a prime-time speech billed as the “Soul of the Nation.”
While in the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence, the president talked about what he believes to be America’s core values and how to fight for them. He also sounded an alarm, saying he sees threats to democracy, and adding that both equality and democracy are under assault.
“For a long time, we’ve reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not. We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand..."
"The U.S. is moving to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status in what President Biden called Friday ""another crushing blow"" against the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
Driving the news: ""We're going to continue to stand together with our allies in Europe and send unmistakable message. We'll defend every single inch of NATO territory of the full might of the united and galvanized NATO,"" Biden said.
Biden said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to wait to move forward on revoking normal trade relations with Russia until he ""could line..."
"Americans are growing increasingly aware of racial inequality in the United States, but a large majority still oppose the use of one-time payments, known as reparations, to tackle the persistent wealth gap between Black and white citizens.
According to Reuters/Ipsos polls this month, only one in five respondents agreed the United States should use “taxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States.”
Calls are growing from some politicians, academics and economists for such payments to be made to an estimated 40 million African Americans,..."
"Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason.
Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be on his ticket.
She was a safe pick and a practical one. She's also now in the position to be the heir apparent for the Democratic Party - whether it's in four years because Biden loses in November or doesn't run for re-election or eight years if Biden serves two..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week that COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising for unvaccinated Americans and also recommended that a booster shot for those who are vaccinated.
“What we’re starting to see now is an uptick in hospitalizations among people who’ve been vaccinated but not boosted,” Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in an interview.
“It’s a significant proportion, but not the majority by any means,” Fauci added.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also noted on Wednesday at a White House COVID briefing, that..."

"Democratic presidential front-runner and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fuelling the white supremacy that’s blamed for several mass shootings in the United States, according to a speech Biden was due to deliver on Wednesday.
Biden, 76, was scheduled to speak in Iowa after back-to-back mass shootings this past weekend in the United States. In the first, on Saturday, a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, a Texas city on the border with Mexico. Law enforcement agencies say he apparently was driven by hatred..."
"Former GOP Sen. John Warner from Virginia, who served in Congress for five terms and played a central role in shaping military affairs legislation, has died. He was 94. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Warner’s Chief of Staff Carter Cornick announced the former senator’s death, and longtime chief of staff Susan A. Magill told The Associated Press that the former Navy secretary’s cause of death was heart failure. 
“He was frail but had a lot of spirit until his last days,” Magill told the news agency, adding that he passed away at his home in..."

Republicans and at least one Democrat on the Senate banking committee are all but certain to grill the Cornell University law professor over unconventional ideas she’s advocated, including magnifying the power of the Federal Reserve to include consumer banking and sweeping checks to the..."
"NBC News’ Kristen Welker will moderate tonight’s debate. Her name has been in the news a lot the past few days, mostly because President Donald Trump keeps running her down, calling her “terrible” and “totally partisan.” But she’s a well-respected journalist, even earning praise from Trump adviser Jason Miller, who called her “very fair.”
She is especially well respected inside NBC News. When she was named a moderator, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim told his staff, “The selection of Kristen as a moderator is a testament to her talent, skill,..."
"A small fleet of whaling vessels have caught their first whales in Japan's first commercial hunt in decades, in defiance of international criticism.
The whaling ships have a permit to catch 227 minke, Bryde's and sei whales this year in Japanese waters.
Japan's last commercial hunt was in 1986, but it has continued whaling for what it says are research purposes.
It has now withdrawn from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) so is no longer subject to its rules.
IWC members had agreed to an effective ban on whale hunting,..."
"President Trump is sending mixed signals to Senate Republicans about what he wants from a soon-to-begin impeachment trial.
Trump’s weekend tweets backing an “outright dismissal” of the articles of impeachment put him at odds with the strategy Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has publicly advocated for weeks.
Most Senate Republicans have embraced the call for no witnesses and say they are sticking with their plan for a trial — albeit a quick one.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), an adviser to McConnell, shrugged off Trump’s criticism, arguing that..."
"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is warning of an increase in threats of violence, including against Supreme Court Justices, if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to a new report.
On Wednesday, NBC News obtained a DHS memo on threats if the nation's highest court goes through with overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed the right for women to get an abortion nationwide.

The memo comes shortly..."
"President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden faced off in the final presidential debate of the campaign. We found:
Trump accused Biden of receiving “$3.5 million from Russia.” There’s no evidence of that.
Biden said there’s “no evidence” that raising the minimum wage causes business bankruptcies. There is, a little.
Trump erred when he said it’s “proven” that a minimum-wage boost would lead to many firings. There’s a chance that the effect could be “about zero,” according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

"BEIJING/HOUSTON (Reuters) - China on Friday ordered the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to a U.S. order for China to shut its Houston consulate, where staff packed up belongings watched by jeering protesters amid a sharp deterioration in relations between the world’s two largest economies.
The order to close the consulate in Chengdu, a city in southwestern China’s Sichuan province, continued Beijing’s recent practice of like-for-like responses to Washington’s actions.
Beijing had threatened retaliation after the Trump administration this week gave it 72 hours -..."

"The nation is concurrently responding to, and recovering from, the COVID-19 pandemic, as the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have declined in recent months. Among the factors that have contributed to the decline in these metrics, the development and administration of multiple vaccines across the nation have been key. About 53.1 percent of the U.S. population 12 years and older—almost 150.7 million individuals—had been fully vaccinated as of June 23, 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"The world will turn its eyes on China this weekend as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) opens its 20th National Party Congress, with 2,300 ruling elites gathering in Beijing. China’s propaganda apparatus has been running at full speed to promote this as the most significant event that will determine the success of the CCP’s second centenary goal: achieving the dream of rejuvenating the Chinese nation.
No doubt, this is an epochal political event in China. This is also the biggest public relations show that the CCP is staging for the..."

"WASHINGTON—The legal team representing the Central Intelligence Agency officer behind the complaint that helped spark an impeachment inquiry into President Trump is now advising “multiple whistleblowers,” the attorneys said Sunday.
The existence of at least one additional whistleblower could complicate President Trump’s efforts to counter the impeachment proceedings building against him in Congress. Mr. Trump repeatedly has sought to attack the credibility and motive of the first individual who filed a formal whistleblower complaint in August.
“I can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers,” Andrew Bakaj,..."

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point—the first increase in more than three years—as it looks to address surging inflation, which remains at 40-year highs, up 7.9% from a year ago."
"Former President Trump, who continues to spread baseless lies about his 2020 defeat, began an unprecedented comeback bid by declaring his 2024 campaign for president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Tuesday night.
Why it matters: Trump — the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, most recently for incitement of insurrection — changed American politics with his unconventional governing style and undeniable grip on the GOP. But his third presidential run comes as Republicans are reevaluating his role as the face of the party following midterm failures and ongoing controversies...."
"As the fight against COVID-19 shifts to Europe and beyond, China is supplying millions of masks and other desperately needed items to struggling governments, hoping to build political ties and defuse criticism that it allowed the disease to spread early on.

"A judge in Mississippi on Tuesday denied a request from the providers asking to temporarily block the state's ""trigger law"" banning nearly all abortions, which is set to take effect on Thursday.
Driving the news: Jackson Women's Health Organization — Mississippi's only abortion clinic — sued state officials last month to challenge the ban, arguing that the right to an abortion is protected under state Supreme Court precedent.
It is the same clinic at the center of the case that resulted in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.

"President Donald Trump cannot block a request to hand over eight years of tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors, a federal judge ruled, after Trump claimed he was immune from being sued.
Trump quickly filed an emergency notice of appeal to the federal appeals court in Manhattan.
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan decided to abstain from resolving the dispute, and therefore dismissed Trump’s lawsuit.
He also criticized Trump for advancing what the judge called an argument that the president, his family and businesses “associated with him in potentially unlawful..."

"Ukraine's military says its forces have retaken over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) during a rapid counter-offensive in eastern Ukraine.
The remarkable advance, if confirmed, means Kyiv's forces have tripled their stated gains in little over 48 hours.
On Thursday evening, President Zelensky put the figure at 1,000 sq km, and then 2,000 sq km on Saturday evening.
The BBC cannot verify the Ukrainian figures, and journalists have been denied access to the frontlines.

"As the Senate was putting the finishing touches on a bipartisan infrastructure bill Monday, Democrats released their $3.5 trillion budget plan that sets the stage for a massive investment in social programs and climate policy.
The plans fit into what Democrats consider a complementary, two-part agenda to boost the economy, strengthen the social safety net and attempt to curb climate change. The party will have to carry out a complicated legislative dance to get both proposals through Congress in the coming months."
"The attorney for the man who oversaw the road closures that have embroiled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a political firestorm said there is evidence that the GOP presidential hopeful knew of the traffic mess while it was taking place, contrary to what the governor said in January.
The allegations, which Mr. Christie's office denied, are the first from a former ally that contradict the account the governor gave at a lengthy news conference about the closing of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, a busy link between..."

"The United States will begin widely distributing Covid-19 booster shots next month as new data shows that vaccine protection wanes over time, top U.S. health officials announced Wednesday.
It’s now “very clear” that immunity starts to fall after the initial two doses, and with the dominance of the delta variant, “we are starting to see evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,” according to the statement signed by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and..."
"The United States government’s top infectious diseases expert on Tuesday warned that daily COVID-19 cases could more than double if Americans fail to take countermeasures and cautioned against pinning hopes on a vaccine.
California, Texas and several other states are reporting record increases in cases of the sometimes deadly illness caused by the novel coronavirus, leading to a sobering reassessment of efforts to contain it and raising the stakes for the scores of vaccine candidates being developed at unprecedented speed.

"Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February dramatically worsened the outlook for already inflated global food prices.
The halt in Ukrainian exports following the outbreak of the conflict pushed the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, to its highest point in March since records began in 1990.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a move Russia calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, is the latest development in a growing global food crisis.

"A majority of Minneapolis City Council has pledged to dismantle the local police department, a significant move amid nationwide protests sparked by George Floyd's death last month.
Nine of the 13 councillors said a ""new model of public safety"" would be created in a city where law enforcement has been accused of racism.
Mayor Jacob Frey earlier opposed the move, drawing boos from the crowds.
Activists, who for years have demanded such a step, called it a turning point.

"Facebook executives tell Axios they're hiring seasoned journalists to help curate a forthcoming ""News Tab"" that they hope will change how millions get news.
Why it matters: News Tab is an effort by Facebook to restore the sanity and credibility that's lost in the chaos of our main feeds. Facebook will personalize the News Tab, so it will need a massive amount of content, from the New York Jets to gardening.

"The New York Times, The Washington Post and NBC News walked back their reporting about the FBI’s communication with President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani regarding Russia.
The Washington Post was the first to report on Thursday that Giuliani was warned that he was the target of a Russian influence campaign last year. The newspaper, citing people familiar with the matter, also reported that One America News Network (OANN) was given a similar warning.
But the Post issued a correction on Saturday saying it had removed assertions that Giuliani..."
"Bill Clinton had Republican William Cohen. George W. Bush had Democrat Norm Mineta. Barack Obama had Republicans Ray LaHood and Chuck Hagel.
Now President-elect Joe Biden, who called for ending this “grim era of demonization in America,” is likewise signaling he might reach across the aisle to name Republicans to a Cabinet post and other key slots in his administration.
It would be a return to bipartisanship, tradition and normalcy that has been missing in the Trump administration. President Trump, who vilified his Democratic opponents and still has..."

"The World Health Organization called Wednesday for a temporary moratorium on the use of Covid-19 vaccine booster shots by wealthy countries, saying the global priority should be on increasing supplies of first doses to countries that are still struggling to protect health workers and older adults.
Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries should hold off on starting to give booster doses until at least the end of September — though it was quickly clear that the global health agency might extend the call if vaccine doses available to lower-income..."
"Moderna Inc. MRNA 16.13% said it will on Monday ask U.S. and European health regulators to authorize use of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine, after it was shown to be 94.1% effective in a full analysis of a pivotal study.
The timing keeps the vaccine on track to become possibly the second to go into use in the U.S. by year’s end—after one already under regulatory review from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE —with inoculation available to the general public likely in spring or summer.

"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee and its former chairman, is suing Twitter and a number of its users for more than $250 million.
The lawsuit filed Monday alleges the social media giant censored conservative voices by ""shadow-banning"" them, which Nunes says potentially impacted the 2018 midterm election results. Others named in the lawsuit include GOP operative Liz Mair, Mair Strategies, ""Devin Nunes' Mom"" (@DevinNunesMom) and ""Devin Nunes' cow"" (@DevinCow), two parody accounts that mocked the Trump ally and California Republican."

"At 62 years old, Jeb Bush is still willing to test his fastball. While gripping a baseball at the Iowa State Fair, the former Florida governor announced a goal of 50 mph. As he whizzed the ball through a canyon of inflated prizes, the radar gun spoke the truth: 44 mph. He tried again: 47.
Whether Mr. Bush can bring the heat to his Republican presidential campaign is a nagging question that now hangs over his candidacy. In Iowa, recent polls sh"
"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Attorney General William Barr for “taking charge” of the case against his long-time adviser and friend Roger Stone, as Democrats pushed investigations into the Justice Department’s actions.
The Justice Department on Tuesday reversed course and urged a lighter sentence for Stone after prosecutors a day earlier recommended that the veteran Republican operative face sentencing within federal guidelines of seven to nine years.
The highly unusual move, which came hours after Trump complained about the recommended sentence on Twitter, prompted all four U.S. prosecutors..."
"Former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Robert Redfield, who was at the helm of the government agency at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, spoke on CNN during the network’s upcoming retrospective on how the pandemic unfolded.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday that Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) is stepping down from his position as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee pending an investigation into possible insider trading.
Why it matters: The news comes one day after reports that the FBI seized Burr's phone as part of the investigation. Burr, who had access to classified briefings about the coronavirus, dumped between $582,029 and $1.56 million in March just prior to the market crash. He has denied wrongdoing."
"Supporters of President Trump and counterprotesters clashed Saturday night after what was a mostly peaceful day of demonstrations in support of Trump and in protest of the election results.
One person was stabbed and more than 20 others arrested, according to local reports.
Violent clashes between Trump supporters and counterprotesters that were caught on tape by The Washington Post showed members from both sides lunging at one another. Objects can be seen being thrown through the air, and people can be seen punching one another."

The agreement, announced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on the floor, includes a $600 check for individuals who make up to $75,000 per year.
Though it's the same income cap included in the March CARES Act, the amount of the check is half of the $1,200 for individuals that was included in the earlier bill.

"The drinking water system in Jackson — Mississippi’s largest city and home to more than 160,000 residents — is failing, state officials announced on Monday. Thousands of Jackson residents already have no or little water pressure, and officials cannot say when adequate, reliable service will be restored.
The city water system has been plagued with problems for years, including tens of thousands of residents losing water between one and three weeks during a 2021 winter storm.
At a press conference Monday night, Gov. Tate Reeves said the city’s largest water..."
"Attacking “waste, fraud and abuse” is a common promise made by both parties, but too often forgotten after the campaigning is over. On the touchy issue of student loan debt forgiveness, President Joe Biden can hardly afford to forget.
On the one hand, everyone knows that debt from student loans is raging out of control. On the other, Democrats don’t want to further compound their popularity problems by forgiving Ivy League tuition for elite big spenders while dinging those who chose to live within their means at college, or who..."
"U.S. Special Envoy for Haiti Daniel Foote resigned Thursday, saying that he did not want to be associated with what he called the United States’ “inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees” back to the island nation.

"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) on Monday introduced the legislative text needed to establish a select committee with subpoena power to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, in advance of an expected vote in the House on Wednesday.
The resolution, which mirrors the language used to create the GOP-led select committee on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, gives Mrs. Pelosi the ability to appoint the chair and 13 members—five of them “after consultation with the minority leader,” a reference to Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.).

An overview of this work shows that Florida and Pennsylvania were heavily targeted by disinformers on Nov. 3. But the consequences of these acts are yet to be determined.
A false photo caption claimed the photo showed an unidentified civilian removing an official ballot box from a polling location in Philadelphia on Election Day. The person in the photo is an election worker who was transporting..."

"Texas schools have started receiving posters of the national motto ""In God We Trust"" that they will be required to display in accordance with a new state law.
The big picture: Those opposed are sounding the alarm about the law, arguing it imposes religion on students and flies in the face of the expectation that schools be secular.
The law, which was passed last year, says elementary and secondary schools must ""display in a conspicuous place in each building of the school or institution a durable poster or framed copy of the United..."
"Congress is on a collision course with President Trump over his national emergency declaration, setting the stage for the first veto of his administration.
A showdown appears all but inevitable with momentum building behind a resolution of disapproval, which clinched the votes needed to pass over the weekend and could pick up several additional Republican supporters ahead of a vote expected to take place in a matter of days.
Top Republicans signaled on Monday that they are resigned to it passing the GOP-controlled Senate, an embarrassing setback for Trump that..."

In two brief orders issued shortly after 7 p.m., the justices denied, without explanation, a request by Republicans to put the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling on hold.

"New York City will now require employees at private companies to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in an interview with MSNBC early Monday.
The new mandate comes after New York identified eight cases of the omicron variant and the United States once again averages 100,000 new, reported cases of the virus every day. It will cover about 184,000 businesses and applies to all in-person employees who work in an office with others."

"At a town hall event in the swing state of Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump made several false and misleading claims, some of which we have repeatedly debunked before.
He further embellished his talking points on trade with China, claiming China “didn’t do anything with us” before his recent trade agreement.

"The Food and Drug Administration said it would allow some hearing aids to be sold over the counter, aiming to widen their availability in ways that could bring down costs and encourage development of better devices.
Some 30 million adults in the U.S. have trouble with their hearing, the FDA said, but only about 20% use a hearing aid. High costs, challenges with access and social stigma discourage some people from using the devices, the FDA said. The devices can cost thousands of dollars and often aren’t covered by insurance."

But views are deeply divided along partisan lines, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

"Small dominoes can eventually topple big nations. The Taliban started tipping dominoes in local provinces and before long had most of Afghanistan under its control. Kabul was merely the last domino to fall.
The last domino in Afghanistan that is, certainly not the last around the globe.
The aftershocks of the failed U.S. withdrawal will reverberate for some time. If the U.S. should lose its historic mantle of supporting peace through strength, we will have to reckon with the consequences of chaos that results from perceived weakness.

"More than 190 nations reached a deal at the United Nations summit here that aims to accelerate greenhouse-gas-emissions cuts across the world, but leaves big questions over how governments will follow through in the coming decade to try to avert the worst effects of global warming.
Supporters say the deal—struck Saturday evening after two weeks of negotiations—signals new determination among the world’s governments to shift away from burning fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gases that scientists say are causing the earth to warm. The agreement, though, features weaknesses that have hamstrung..."
"Black Friday can provide an odd contrast both with the day before, Thanksgiving, and the forthcoming holiday to which it is directed — the celebration of the birth of Christ.
Capitalism may be the most efficient way to satisfy market needs while reducing prices and increasing efficiencies through competition. But if people don’t temper it with timeless virtues, the result can be devastating.
Think unbridled greed and corruption. Think about the Biblical grinding of the faces of the poor, to paraphrase Isaiah. Think about the opposite of the Christ child, who..."
"Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, marks the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. But in a year of pervasive supply chain disruptions, we can expect to see higher prices, more competition for hot items, and probably a lot of late bargains. So, my shopping advice is kind of mixed, but keep some of that holiday shopping budget available for late arriving merchandise or sales.
If you shop at many of the big box retailers, you will probably find lots of goods available, although the product selection on display..."
"Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are criticizing the FBI over its handling of the tip line in its investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The Democrats, led by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Chris Coons (Del.), wrote a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday seeking answers after the agency revealed it gathered more than 4,500 tips in relation to its investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh.
The lawmakers wrote that revelation “confirms that the FBI’s tip line was a departure from past practice and that the FBI was politically constrained..."

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is teasing the possibility of executive action to require health insurance companies to cover preexisting medical conditions, something that he says “has never been done before.”

"In his Monday speech defending America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, President Biden said he would not shrink from his share of responsibility.
That would include his decision to bring home U.S. troops, which was made against the recommendations of his top military generals and many diplomats, who warned that a hasty withdrawal would undermine security in Afghanistan, several administration and defense officials said.
The president’s top generals, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley, urged Mr. Biden to keep a force of about 2,500 troops, the size..."

Members of the panel didn’t recommend U.S. regulators restrict the use of the vaccine based on age or gender, but they did propose that the FDA consider adding a warning label for women under the age 50.

Governor, Ralph Northam, and in doing so underperformed President Trump who lost the state to Hillary Clinton by 5 percentage points in 2016.

The law, which Newson signed alongside rappers, record producers and record industry executives who were present virtually, is the first in the country to ensure someone’s “creative expression” is not used to “introduce stereotypes or active bias” against a defendant or be used as evidence in a trial against them. 
It also requires courts to determine..."
"Education leaders in a small New Mexico city are among a number of school districts turning to a four-day school week as a way to recruit teachers amid a nationwide teacher shortage, hoping three-day weekends will make their district more attractive than others. But it’s unclear if the format will work everywhere.
For years, New Mexico’s Socorro Consolidated Schools struggled to attract teachers, according to Superintendent Ron Hendrix. The district serves a small area nestled between Albuquerque and Las Cruces.
“Anybody new coming out of college, if they’ve got the choice between Albuquerque or Las..."
"The Obama administration on Friday set final rules for contraception coverage in workers’ health insurance plans, putting in place rules that are unlikely to satisfy some religious employers who object to birth control.
The rules reaffirmed that most health plans have to include birth control with no out-of-pocket costs as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The regulations include alternative arrangements for employers such"
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) tore into journalists working for CBS News, calling them ""smear merchants"" and accusing them of peddling a ""horse manure"" narrative about the coronavirus vaccine rollout in his state.
""These are smear merchants. That's why nobody trusts corporate media. They are a disaster in what they are doing,"" DeSantis said during a press conference in Panama City on Tuesday morning. ""They knew what they were doing was a lie.""
On Sunday evening, CBS reporter Sharyn Alfonsi presented a far-ranging report for ""60 Minutes"" that criticized..."
"Following Joe Biden’s narrow presidential win in Georgia, early voting is underway in the state’s Jan. 5 runoff election for two U.S. Senate seats, races that will determine whether both chambers of Congress are led by Democrats during the first years of the new administration. Once a reliably Republican state, Georgia has received much attention for the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of eligible voters in the state, which has highlighted the importance of Black voters and other fast-growing groups like Latino and Asian voters.
Black voters in Georgia had..."
"A coalition of mostly Democratic-led states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing its rules for addressing power plant pollution are so weak they violate federal law.
Attorneys general from 22 states and several major cities including New York City and Los Angeles argue that the Trump administration's rule violates the Clean Air Act by having virtually no impact on carbon emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had finalized the rule in June to repeal and replace a capstone Obama-era carbon pollution regulation they say exceeded agency authority."
"NASA's uncrewed Artemis I launch of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule was called off on Monday.
Why it matters: NASA plans to use the SLS rocket and Orion to return people to the Moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program in the 1970s.
The latest: An engine issue prevented the SLS from getting off the pad in Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
One of the rocket's four engines didn't get up to the correct temperature, preventing the space agency from launching.
NASA has backup launch dates..."
"President Trump on Thursday appealed to the Supreme Court, asking it to reverse a court order requiring his accountants to hand over eight years of tax returns, in a dramatic escalation of his fight to keep his financial records private.
Trump’s request comes after a federal appeals court in New York last week said Manhattan prosecutors could enforce a subpoena against Trump’s accounting firm Mazars USA for his personal and corporate financial records from 2011 to 2018.
A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit last week said Manhattan prosecutors..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who just weeks ago excoriated former President Trump on the Senate floor, blaming him for the riot at the Capitol, on Thursday said he would back Trump if he wins the party's 2024 presidential nomination.
""There's a lot to happen between now and '24. I've got at least four members that I think are planning on running for president. ... Should be a wide open race,"" McConnell said during an interview with Fox News's Bret Baier.
Asked if he would support Trump if he..."
"The pace of U.S. consumer price increases moderated somewhat in August but remained close to a four-decade high.
The Labor Department on Tuesday reported its consumer-price index rose 8.3% in August from the same month a year ago, down from 8.5% in July and from 9.1% in June, which was the highest inflation rate in four decades. The CPI measures what consumers pay for goods and services.
So-called core CPI, which excludes often volatile energy and food prices, increased 6.3% in August from a year earlier, up sharply from the 5.9% rate in both..."
"As record-high temperatures recently swept across several parts of the U.S. this summer, new data on heat risks forecast an “extreme heat belt” will emerge in large parts of the country by 2053. 
The heat model released Monday by researchers from the nonprofit group First Street Foundation estimates heat risks at the property level across the U.S. and how the intensity of hot days will change over the next three decades. 
The model identified the seven hottest days for any property this year and used that metric to determine how..."
"Spotify (SPOT.N) Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said on Sunday he ""strongly"" condemns racial slurs and other comments made by popular U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan but will not be removing him from the platform.
Ek's comments, sent in a letter to staff seen by Reuters, come on the heels of Rogan issuing an apology for the second time in a week, the latest for using racial slurs after a montage video surfaced showing him repeatedly using the N-word.
Ek said it was Rogan's decision to remove a number of past episodes from ""The Joe..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday said the chamber’s Democrats are exploring legislation to protect personal data stored on reproductive health apps, ensure the right to free travel between states and codify the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade case.
The ideas, posed by Pelosi to fellow House Democrats in a letter dated Monday, follows the court’s Friday decision to upend nearly 50 years of abortion rights in the U.S. The decision has sparked nationwide outrage from supporters of abortion access in the days since...."
"With the Justice Department’s move Thursday to drop its case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, it’s useful to go back to a basic question: If Flynn did nothing wrong when he called the Russian ambassador on Dec. 29, 2016, the day President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the presidential election, why did he conceal it?
One issue from the beginning was whether Flynn’s call to Ambassador Sergey Kislyak violated the Logan Act, which bars private U.S. citizens from trying to influence another country about..."
"House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said in a recent interview that voters' economic concerns are not as important as protecting democracy.
The South Carolina Democrat told Fox News on Thursday that Americans should ponder whether they want to live in a democracy or autocracy, conjuring past comments made by former President Donald Trump in which he called the press ""the enemy of the people.""
""I think that people should be voting in their own self-interest,"" Clyburn said. ""And their self-interest is much more than what you may or may not..."
"In the two months since signing the $1 trillion infrastructure bill into law, President Biden has by almost every measure bombed big time on the things that matter most.
The big picture: Biden, who marks one year in office next Thursday, has never been less popular nationally, after personally lobbying his party and the public on Build Back Better and voting rights — and failing.
Baffling COVID messaging caused former Biden advisers to stage a media intervention, going public with a call for a less reactive strategy.
Why it matters: Biden is on the verge of losing two big fights of his choosing..."
"Former President Barack Obama has cautioned young Democrat activists against using snappy slogans such as ""defund the police"" if they want to bring about genuine reforms in the US.
Defund the Police became a widely-used phrase after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.
Mr Obama said ""you lost a big audience the minute you say it"", making it ""a lot less likely"" to effect change.
His comments received a backlash from some key black progressive Democrats.
Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted ""it's not a slogan but..."
"President Biden strongly condemned racist conspiracy theories in a speech Tuesday after visiting Tops Friendly Markets grocery store, the site of a mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., where 10 people were killed in an alleged hate crime over the weekend.
Mr. Biden choked back tears as he named the victims of the shooting. “In America, evil will not win, I promise you; hate will not prevail, and white supremacy will not have the last word,” he said.
The shooting suspect, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, appears to have been motivated by racist conspiracy theories he discovered..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday set the stage for a major ruling next year on abortion – one that could upend the Supreme Court’s landmark decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the court ruled that the Constitution protects the right to have an abortion before a fetus becomes viable. The court granted review in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a challenge to the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that (with limited exceptions) bars abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.
The decision to..."
"President Biden will ""continue to re-evaluate"" the U.S.' relationship with Saudi Arabia after a group of international oil exporters and Russia decided to significantly cut oil production in response to falling fuel prices, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Tuesday.
Driving the news: The White House warned last week that Biden may support legislation aimed at reducing OPEC’s control over energy prices, suggesting Biden is considering a new, escalatory approach with the Saudis, Axios' Alayna Treene and Hans Nichols report.
Kirby reiterated this warning Tuesday, stressing that Biden is ""willing""..."
"President Joe Biden and the White House came under fire yesterday for claiming that inflation for July was ""zero""—despite that being one of the official statistics.
Speaking from the White House, Biden said: ""I want to say a word about news that came out today relative to the economy. Actually, I just want to say a number: zero."" He continued, ""Today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July.""
This led to some incredulous responses, reminiscent of the recent debate over whether the country is in a recession..."
"Republican state lawmakers on Friday were poised to pass a bill to sharply restrict abortions in the state, rebuffing a challenge from Democratic legislators, who derailed the measure last month with help from a marathon filibuster.
The law would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with only rare exceptions, adding Texas to a list of about dozen states with a similar cutoff. It would also impose strict limits on abortion providers, which supporters of abortion rights say could effectively shut down most abortion clinics in Texas, the second most..."
"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) said Thursday that she plans to ""move forward"" with a revised version of Democrats' reconciliation bill after reaching a deal to scale back some of the original tax provisions and beef up climate funding.
Why it matters: Sinema was potentially the last hurdle for Democrats who have been seeking to clinch President Biden's longtime goal of passing an ambitious package tackling climate change, health care and taxes — renamed the ""Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.""
""We have agreed to remove the carried interest tax provision, protect advanced manufacturing,..."
"Veterans Day is intended to honor all the people who served in the American armed forces, both those who are alive and those who died, although it's largely geared toward living veterans.
Often confused with Memorial Day, the key difference between Veterans Day and the May holiday is that Memorial Day is intended to honor those who gave their lives in service of their country. Veterans Day, celebrated months later on November 11, is a day to express gratitude to America's service members, past and present, who served in both..."
"The union representing journalists at the Bloomberg industry publication group on Monday condemned the company's decision to bar journalists across the broader Bloomberg organization from investigating Democratic candidates for president.
In a statement released on Twitter, the guild, which represents Bloomberg Law, Bloomberg Tax, Bloomberg Government and Bloomberg Environment called the company's decision an effort to ""silence"" the company's reporters.
""We are extremely alarmed by management's decision to silence the journalists we represent at Bloomberg Industry Group, as well as the unrepresented journalists at Bloomberg News,"" the guild wrote.

"The House committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol kicked off a prime-time hearing Thursday with searing charges against Donald Trump, painting a portrait of the former president at the center of a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. 
Trump, charged Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who leads the Jan. 6 panel, engaged in “what became a sprawling, multi-step conspiracy aimed at overturning the presidential election,” that was aimed at replacing Americans’ votes “with his will to remain in power after his term ended.” 
“Donald..."
"US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.
He accused the UN agency of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China, and said it must be held accountable.
In response, the UN's chief said it was ""not the time"" to cut funds to the WHO.
Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic...."
"US presidential candidate Donald Trump has publicly backed House Speaker Paul Ryan days after snubbing him in a spat at the top of the Republican Party.
Mr Trump shocked party members on Tuesday when he refused to endorse Mr Ryan and Senator John McCain in their campaigns for re-election in November."
"The Delta coronavirus variant doubles the risk of hospitalisation compared with the previously dominant variant in Britain, but two doses of vaccine still provide strong protection, a Scottish study found on Monday.
The study said early evidence suggested the protection from vaccines against the Delta variant, first identified in India, might be lower than the effectivessness against the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, southeast England.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to delay the ending of COVID-19 restrictions in England on Monday, following a rapid rise in cases..."
"A poverty-fighting measure included in the COVID-19 relief bill passed this year will deliver monthly payments to households including 88% of children in the United States, starting in July, Biden administration officials said on Monday.
The Democratic-backed American Rescue Plan, signed into law by President Joe Biden in March as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, expanded a tax credit available to most parents.
Those people will get up to $3,000 per child, or $3,600 for each child under the age of 6, in 2021, subject to income restrictions. The..."
"House impeachment managers on Tuesday made their case for the indictment of former President Trump in a brief, arguing that he pushed his supporters into a ""frenzy,"" while dubbing him ""singularly responsible"" for the deadly siege at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
What they're saying: The Democratic managers argue that Trump's actions were not protected by the First Amendment, stating, ""If provoking an insurrectionary riot against a Joint Session of Congress after losing an election is not an impeachable offense, it is hard to imagine what would be.""
""It is..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said Monday that he believed Democrats ""should"" be able to get a deal on a framework agreement for President Biden's social spending bill this week.
""Having it finished with all the t's and the i's and everything you know crossed and dotted that will be difficult from the Senate side because we have an awful lot of text to go through, but as far as conceptually we should, I really believe,"" Manchin told reporters on Monday."
"COVID-19 vaccine mandates have become a hotly contested issue, as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations rebound nationwide, driven by the highly contagious delta variant and unswerving vaccine hesitancy. New York City will soon be the first major U.S. city to require proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, gyms and other indoor public spaces. Dr. Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and editor in chief of MedPage Today, argues that mandating vaccines for ""every living, walking American"" is, as of now, not well-supported by science. Moreover Makary, author of..."
"Former Secretary of State John Kerry threw his support behind Joe Biden’s presidential campaign on Thursday, saying that the former vice president is “uniquely the person running for president who can beat Donald Trump” in 2020.
“I believe Joe Biden is the President our country desperately needs right now, not because I’ve known Joe so long, but because I know Joe so well,” Kerry, a former U.S. senator and the Democratic Party’s 2004 presidential nominee, said in a statement released by Biden’s campaign.
“I’ve never before seen the world more..."
"The National Football League team in Washington, D.C., will officially retire the team’s name and logo, the club announced Monday. A new name was not announced.
The organization, which had its name since 1932, launched a review of its name after partners and sponsors began to criticize the team for failing to acknowledge the sensitivity regarding the name and logo to Native Americans.
“We want to keep our sponsors, fans and community apprised of our thinking as we go forward,” the team said in a statement. “Today, we are..."

"President Biden on Sunday said he will call on Russian President Vladimir Putin to respect human rights when the two leaders meet in Geneva in June.
“I had a long conversation, two hours recently, with [Chinese] President Xi, making it clear to him that we can do nothing but speak out for human rights around the world because that’s who we are. I’ll be meeting with President Putin in a couple weeks in Geneva making it clear that we will not, we will not, stand by and let him abuse those rights,” Biden..."
"Presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) did not hold back Friday when responding to 2016 nominee Hilary Clinton's suggestion that she is the ""favorite of the Russians"" for 2020, excoriating the former secretary of State as ""the queen of warmongers"" and ""personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.""
“She’s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her, so far,” Clinton had told David Plouffe, host of the podcast “Campaign HQ,” and the campaign manager for former..."
"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating a potentially criminal scheme involving paying a bribe to people either in or affiliated with the White House in exchange for an unknown person receiving a presidential pardon, according to court documents that were unsealed Tuesday.
The court records, which were unsealed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, say the DOJ investigation involves two people, whose names are redacted, who were improperly acting as lobbyists to secure the pardon for a person whose name is also redacted. The plot..."
"CNN's new boss, Chris Licht, is evaluating whether personalities and programming that grew polarizing during the Trump era can adapt to the network's new priority to be less partisan.
Why it matters: If talent cannot adjust to a less partisan tone and strategy, they could be ousted, three sources familiar with the matter tell Axios.
Details: Licht wants to give personalities that may appear polarizing a chance to prove they're willing to uphold the network's values so that they don't tarnish CNN's journalism brand.
For on-air talent, that includes engaging in respectful

"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday launched its biggest broadside yet against inflation, raising benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point in a move that equates to the most aggressive hike since 1994.
Ending weeks of speculation, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee took the level of its benchmark funds rate to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, the highest since just before the Covid pandemic began in March 2020."
"Democratic gloom is deepening as the party looks toward November’s midterms and beyond. 
The bleak outlook is engendered in part by a grim political environment marked by historically high inflation, elevated gas prices and pandemic fatigue. 
But the Democratic depression is sharpened by concerns over whether President Biden is really the man for the moment, given his advancing age — he turns 80 in November — and his preference for consensus-building over the frontal political combat many in his party would prefer.
Yet, for all that, Biden has one sizable factor weighing..."
"Hurricane Ian likely caused $53 billion to $74 billion in insured losses from Florida to the Carolinas, with a ""best estimate"" of $67 billion, according to new data released today from modeling firm RMS.
The big picture: These preliminary damage totals would make Hurricane Ian the costliest storm in Florida history and second nationally to Hurricane Katrina when adjusted for inflation.
The storm, which devastated densely populated areas of southwest Florida — including Ft. Myers, Naples and barrier island communities such as Sanibel Island — killed at least 92 people..."
"A Texas doctor who admitted to breaking the state's new abortion legislation has been sued, in what could be a test of how lawful the mandate is.
Writing for the Washington Post, Alan Braid said he had carried out a termination on a woman who was in the early stages of her pregnancy but ""beyond the state's new limit"".
Former lawyers in Arkansas and Illinois filed lawsuits against him on Monday.
The new legislation bans abortions from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.
The law came into effect..."
"Employers add 266,000 jobs, unemployment rate drops to 50-year low of 3.5%.
The U.S. job market strengthened in November, as hiring jumped and unemployment fell, adding fuel to the economic expansion.
Employers added 266,000 jobs in November and the jobless rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5%, matching September’s level, the Labor Department said Friday. Wages advanced 3.1% from a year earlier.
The stronger pace of hiring could help juice up the broader U.S. economy, which is still expanding but at a slower pace than last year. U.S. stock..."
"Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said she believes the Republican Party is ""very sick"" and may not be able to recover in the near future, The New York Times reported.
The big picture: Cheney, who serves as the vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, has long questioned the party's attachment to former President Donald Trump.
However, Cheney is now bracing for possible defeat in her state's Republican primary on Aug. 16 at the hands of a Trump-backed challenger. Her opponent Harriet Hageman is currently 22 points ahead of the congresswoman in the

"Ceremonies honoring the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg moved to the U.S. Capitol, where she became the first woman and the first Jewish person to lie in state.
Justice Ginsburg, the de facto leader of the court’s liberal wing, succumbed last Friday to metastatic pancreatic cancer at the age of 87, creating a vacancy late in a presidential election year. Many Republicans want to fill the vacancy by Election Day, which is just 39 days away.
The pioneering jurist was honored in an invitation-only ceremony that was intended to remember..."
"The stock market tanked on Friday, adding to heavy losses this week that pushed the S&P 500 into a bear market, down over 20% from its peak in January as investors continue to get whipsawed by concerns about inflationary pressures and rising rates.
The selloff on Wall Street continued with a vengeance: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6%, over 500 points, while the S&P 500 lost 1.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 2.7%."
"President Biden on Thursday forcefully rebuked former President Trump in an address marking the anniversary of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, accusing the former president of spreading a “web of lies” that laid the groundwork for the attack by a mob of Trump supporters one year ago. 
In a lengthy address from Statuary Hall, Biden said that Trump put his own interests over those of the country and directly and forcefully disputed the former president’s false claims that Biden’s election was won with fraudulent votes. "
"U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he sees room for a compromise on his proposal for trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending after meeting with Republican leaders but will move forward without the opposition party if necessary.
In their first White House meeting since Biden, a Democrat, took office in January, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy signaled a willingness to work with the president on infrastructure but drew the line at tax increases."
"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who suspended his presidential bid in February after several primary losses, endorsed Wednesday morning Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Wednesday, a man he had criticized frequently while still in the running. Cruz isn’t the only remaining candidate Bush could have endorsed, of course, but what is striking is that Bush seems much closer aligned with the politics of the alternative hopeful, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and there hasn’t exactly been love between the Bush family and the Texas senator."
"Widespread rioting and looting erupted on the streets of Chicago after people clashed with police over an officer-involved shooting the previous day.
Hundreds of people were seen ransacking businesses during a period of unrest which lasted several hours across the city from late Sunday into Monday morning.
Dozens of stores were looted along the ""Magnificent Mile"" shopping district, as well as other areas of Chicago.
Footage appearing on social media showed officers pelted with objects and people breaking into banks by smashing windows with baseball bats.
The violence saw the..."
"Hundreds of people swept through the Magnificent Mile and other parts of downtown Chicago early Monday, smashing windows, looting stores, confronting police and at one point exchanging gunfire with officers, authorities said.
More than 100 people were arrested as of 9 a.m., according to Chicago police Superintendent David Brown. Thirteen officers were injured during the unrest, including a sergeant who was hit by a bottle. A civilian and private security guard were shot and wounded.
“What occurred in our downtown and surrounding communities was abject criminal behavior, pure and simple,”..."
"Attorney General William Barr has ordered the removal of a top U.S. prisons official following Jeffrey Epstein’s death.
In a statement Monday, the attorney general said he will name Kathleen Hawk Sawyer the new director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. She will replace Hugh Hurwitz, the acting director of the agency that oversees inmates in federal prisons.

"Former Vice-President Joe Biden has come under attack from other Democratic 2020 candidates in a televised debate.
There were sharp exchanges on healthcare and the southern border between the frontrunner and nine other hopefuls on stage in Detroit.
In an echo of the last debate in June, Senator Kamala Harris launched another assault on Mr Biden's record on race.
But she herself had to defend her actions against drug offenders when she was a prosecutor in California.
""She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, then laughed about..."
"Despite entreaties to stay away, President Donald Trump heads to Kenosha, Wisconsin on Tuesday to highlight his “law and order” campaign theme in a city upended by protests after the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer.

"Former President Donald Trump visits the U.S.-Mexico border on Wednesday as he seeks to reclaim the spotlight, riding a wave of Republican attacks on President Joe Biden over the rise in migrants caught entering the United States.
The trip with Texas Governor Greg Abbott to an unfinished section of border wall near Weslaco at the southern tip of Texas is the second public appearance this week by the Republican Trump, who lost to Biden, a Democrat, in a November election.
Trump pilloried Biden at an Ohio rally on Saturday, his first such..."
"“AMERICANS’ BELIEF IN GLOBAL WARMING sinks as Republicans shift,” a headline on CNN reads. The piece, from 2009, reports on a poll showing that roughly a third of those who accept that global warming is real “think it is due to natural causes, rather than manmade causes such as industrial emissions.” As a reaction to a Democratic White House, the article suggests, the number of people in America who believe that global warming has been caused by humans fell—from 54 percent in the summer to 45 percent in December. And,..."
"U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will cap a busy day of inauguration pageantry by using the powers of his new office to push policy changes on housing, student loans, climate change and immigration, a top aide said on Saturday.
Biden, who campaigned on a raft of promises to undo President Donald Trump’s legacy even before the novel coronavirus pandemic walloped the nation, will unveil “roughly a dozen” previously promised executive actions on Wednesday, incoming Biden chief of staff Ron Klain said in a memo distributed to reporters.
The actions to be..."
"The Federal Trade Commission filed a new antitrust complaint against Facebook on Thursday, continuing its fight in federal court after a judge threw out its initial claims.
Facebook has until Oct. 4 to respond to the FTC’s amended complaint.
FTC Chair Lina Khan notably did not recuse herself from the vote on the complaint after Facebook petitioned her to do so based on her past critical statements of the industry. In a press release, the agency said that its Office of General Counsel “carefully reviewed Facebook’s petition to recuse Chair Lina M. Khan. As the case..."
"The vice president of the United States officially accepted the nomination to continue being the vice president. He did so in a controversial and scathing speech toward the Democrats. Under normal circumstances, this would have been, easily, the biggest story of the night.
On Wednesday, it barely cracked the top five.
In what was an incredibly jam-packed day, news organizations were scrambling to cover four other huge stories."
"Sen. Joe Manchin said Sunday will vote against the sweeping federal election reform bill introduced by congressional Democrats, called the For the People Act, a move essentially guaranteeing the legislation will fail to pass in Congress.
“I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening blinds of our democracy, and for that reason, I will vote against the For The People Act,” the moderate West Virginia Democrat wrote wrote in an op-ed published in the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
“The truth, I would argue, is that voting and election reform that is done in a partisan..."
"Florida has become the latest US state to ban transgender girls and women from participating in female sports at public schools and colleges.
The state's Republican governor Ron DeSantis signed the measure into law on Tuesday.
The law says women and girls must play on the teams of the biological sex on their birth certificate.
LGBT activists have denounced the move as ""discriminatory"", with one group vowing to launch a legal challenge."
"The Obama administration on Thursday rolled out new efforts aimed at curtailing gun violence, announcing steps to limit imports of certain military-style weapons and close a loophole that allows certain purchasers to evade background checks.
The new regulations build on earlier efforts by President Barack Obama to reduce gun violence and come as sweeping changes to the nation's gun laws have failed to gain traction in Congress.
The White House, in announcing the new regulations, said the changes should help keep dangerous weapons off the nation's streets. One proposal would..."
"Mikhail Gorbachev, who ended the Cold War without bloodshed but failed to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union, died on Tuesday at the age of 91, hospital officials in Moscow said.
Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, forged arms reduction deals with the United States and partnerships with Western powers to remove the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since World War Two and bring about the reunification of Germany.
But his broad internal reforms helped weaken the Soviet Union to the point where it fell apart, a moment that..."
"President Biden plans to announce Tuesday that he is moving up his target for all American adults to become eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccine by almost two weeks to April 19, according to a White House official.
Biden is also expected to announce that the United States has administered 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, the official confirmed, putting the president on track to meet or exceed his goal of administering 200 million doses in his first 100 days in office.
CNN first reported Biden’s planned announcements on Tuesday. The..."
"The Department of Justice will review law enforcement’s response to Tuesday’s elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the agency announced Sunday, after local police were criticized for not quickly confronting the shooter.
The review aims to offer an independent account of law enforcement’s actions on the day of the shooting, and will identify lessons for first responders preparing for future active shooter incidents, DOJ spokesperson Anthony Coley said in a statement.
The review was requested by Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin and will be carried out by the DOJ’s Community Oriented..."
"Vice President Pence was sued Sunday by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and several other Republicans in a far-fetched bid that appeared aimed at overturning President-elect Joe Biden's election win.
The lawsuit focuses on Pence’s role in an upcoming Jan. 6 meeting of Congress to count states’ electoral votes and finalize Biden’s victory over President Trump. Typically, the vice president’s role in presiding over the meeting is a largely ceremonial one governed by an 1887 federal law known as the Electoral Count Act."
"The House voted 231-192 on Wednesday to pass an emergency spending bill aimed at addressing the baby formula shortage.
The big picture: The U.S. has faced a nationwide baby formula shortage due to pandemic-induced supply chain issues and recent product recall. Earlier Wednesday, President Biden announced he had invoked the Defense Production Act to help address formula supply.
Details: The bill gives the Food and Drug Administration $28 million to increase its staff to help inspect baby formula before it arrives on grocery store shelves.
It will also look ""to prevent future shortages, including such steps as may be..."
"A US police officer who died after January's Capitol riot had two strokes and died from natural causes, the chief medical examiner for Washington DC has ruled.
Two men are accused of using a type of pepper spray on Officer Brian Sicknick.
However, the ruling means they are now unlikely to be charged with homicide.
The autopsy found no evidence of an allergic reaction to chemicals, nor of internal or external injuries, Dr Francisco Diaz said.
Officer Sicknick, 42, was defending the Capitol building from supporters of then President Donald..."
"The Senate on Wednesday voted to confirm Merrick Garland as attorney general, placing the longtime federal appeals court judge and onetime Supreme Court pick at the helm of an agency central to President Joe Biden's domestic policy agenda.
The vote was 70-30. Garland takes over as the head of the Department of Justice as the sprawling agency continues to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, one of the largest probes in its history. Garland has called the inquiry his No. 1 priority.
The Justice Department will also..."
"The Senate passed the most sweeping firearms legislation in decades, with a coalition of more than a dozen Republicans joining Democrats to provide new tools to deter mass shootings following deadly attacks around the nation.
The 65-33 vote capped a month of negotiations, led by Sens. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) and John Cornyn (R., Texas), who were tasked by the leaders of their respective parties with finding a compromise on one of the most contentious topics in American politics.
The legislation, which provides roughly $15 billion in funding, would help states put..."
"Facebook is halting political spending for at least the first quarter of 2021 following last week's deadly attack on the Capitol.
Why it matters: Tech companies have been de-platforming President Donald Trump and his supporters at a rapid pace since the attacks, and freezing political giving may be the next step tech companies take to show they're seriously rethinking their approach to Washington.
Details: Facebook will freeze all contributions from its political action committee and is launching a review of its political spending practices, company spokesman Andy Stone told Axios."
"Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson plans to ask holdover U.S. attorneys appointed by former President Donald Trump to resign, officials familiar with the matter said, as the Biden administration moves to put its stamp on the Justice Department.
Exempt from the decision, however, are two top prosecutors overseeing politically sensitive inquiries, including Delaware U.S. attorney David Weiss, whose office is conducting a criminal tax investigation into President Biden’s son, Hunter, a senior Justice Department official said.
Another prosecutor, John Durham, is expected to remain as a special counsel overseeing a..."
"Hate crimes have surged nearly 20 percent during the administration of President Donald Trump, according to a new FBI report on hate crime statistics. The report also shows that hate-motivated murders, largely committed by white supremacists, spiked to their highest number in 28 years.
The FBI's annual reports on hate crime statistics show that hate crimes have increased from 6,121 incidents in 2016 to 7,314 in 2019, a 19.49 percent increase.
Hate-motivated murders spiked to a total of 51 in 2019, the highest number in nearly 3 decades, according to..."
"U.S. hate crime incidents increased 2.7% last year, rising to their highest level in more than a decade, the FBI says in a new report.
There were 7,314 hate crime incidents last year, up from 7,120 in 2018 — the highest number since 2008, according to the report released on Monday.
Despite a slight decline in 2018, hate crimes surged nearly 21% during the first three years of President Donald Trump’s administration, a period marked by the rise of an increasingly violent far-right movement."
"Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday as the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court in a milestone for the United States and a victory for President Joe Biden, who made good on a campaign promise as he seeks to infuse the federal judiciary with a broader range of backgrounds.
The vote to confirm the 51-year-old federal appellate judge to a lifetime job on the nation's top judicial body was 53-47, with three Republicans - Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney - joining..."
"President Biden said Thursday he will pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession and will call on governors to pardon simple state possession offenses.
Why it matters: It could amount to ""thousands"" of pardons, which would remove a burden that may have prevented some people from receiving employment, housing or educational opportunities, Biden said.
Biden said he will also ask Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra to begin a review of how marijuana is scheduled as a drug under federal law.
What they're saying: ""As I’ve said before, no one should..."
"Former President Trump on Monday issued a 12-page rebuttal to testimony and evidence presented by a House committee investigating the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, accusing Democrats of seeking to distract from a series of domestic issues facing the country.
“Seventeen months after the events of January 6th, Democrats are unable to offer solutions,” Trump said in a statement released through his Save America PAC. “They are desperate to change the narrative of a failing nation, without even making mention of the havoc and death caused by the Radical Left just..."
"The Senate barreled toward a pair of Wednesday deadlines for advancing much of President Biden’s multitrillion-dollar economic agenda, with lawmakers bracing for a procedural vote on a still-forming $1 trillion infrastructure plan to fail as bipartisan negotiations dragged on.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has set a vote for Wednesday to begin consideration of infrastructure legislation, a step that Republicans have said they would oppose absent more details on its contents and how it would be paid for.
Mr. Schumer is also pushing for all 50 members of the Democratic..."
"President Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the November election and predicted the outcome would be decided by the Supreme Court, a reason he wants to quickly fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
“I think this will end up in the Supreme Court. And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday.
During an event on social-media companies Wednesday, Mr. Trump amplified his long-running claim of widespread ballot fraud—which studies show is rare—and asserted..."
"President Joe Biden on Sunday said that the recent spread of monkeypox in at least 12 countries are ""something that everybody should be concerned about.""
Why it matters: These are the president's first public remarks about the recent outbreaks, which include a confirmed case in Massachusetts, a person who tested positive in New York and roughly a half dozen other cases being monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential,"" Biden told reporters at Osan Air Base

"President Donald Trump said from his hospital room on Saturday that he felt “much better” but the next few days will be “the real test” of his treatment for COVID-19, capping a day of contradictory messages from the White House about his condition. In a four-minute video posted on Twitter, Trump, looking tired and wearing a jacket and open-necked shirt, said he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he first arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.
“Over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s..."
"Willie Lathon Jr., a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Vietnam War, died June 3, less than three months into the pandemic.
He was buried alongside other veterans and their families in Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the only military honor provided to Lathon’s family was folding and presenting them with an American flag.
“I gave his daughter the flag,” said his wife, Sheraine Lathon, 69, of Richton Park. “Then I offered him up to the Lord. That was it. It was about..."
"One Capitol Police officer was killed and another was injured after a car rammed one of the barriers surrounding the Capitol complex on Friday, forcing the area into a lockdown, with police fatally shooting the suspect.
Police said a vehicle ran into two officers. A suspect exited the vehicle with a knife and started ""lunging"" toward officers, who then fired on the person, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said at a briefing Friday afternoon.
""He did not respond to verbal commands. The suspect did start lunging toward U.S. Capitol..."
"President Biden, after meeting Pope Francis, said the pontiff told him to continue receiving Communion, amid a controversy among U.S. church leaders over whether the president’s support for abortion rights should disqualify him from receiving the sacrament.
“We just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving Communion,” Mr. Biden said. The Vatican didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment."
"Iran’s Revolutionary Guard says it seized a British tanker Friday in the Strait of Hormuz, claiming it failed to follow international marine regulations.
The IRGC took the British tanker, Stena Impero, to a coastal area and turned it over to maritime authorities, according to Iran State TV.
Reuters reported that a second British-operated tanker had also taken a sharp northerly turn and was heading toward Iran after passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf. Reuters said the source on the movement of Liberian flagged tanker Mesdar was Refinitiv..."
"Apotential visit to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is stirring alarm in President Joe Biden's administration which fears the trip may cross red lines for China -- and that there is no exit path.
China on Monday warned it was ""getting ready"" for a Pelosi visit to the self-ruling island next month and that the United States would ""bear all responsibility for all serious consequences"" if she goes.
Biden was open last week about concerns, saying the US military opposed travel by Pelosi, a fellow Democrat who is..."
"America's new abortion reality is turning tech firms' data practices into an active field of conflict — a fight that privacy advocates have long predicted and company leaders have long feared.
Why it matters: A long legal siege in which abortion-banning states battle tech companies, abortion-friendly states and their own citizens to gather criminal evidence is now a near certainty.
The once-abstract privacy argument among policy experts has transformed overnight into a concrete real-world problem, superheated by partisan anger, affecting vast swaths of the U.S. population, with tangible and easily

"Voting is a major issue on the right and the left. Both sides want free and fair elections, but they have different ideas of what the problem is with our current election model, with one side more likely to be worried about voter fraud and the other, voter suppression.
Politicians and partisan media often try to motivate their base to subscribe, donate, engage and turn out to vote by blaming the other party. This can slowly degrade citizens’ trust in the democratic process until their fears are resolved or positive..."
"""Cancel culture"", the term for when individuals or companies face swift public backlash and boycott over offensive statements or actions, has been an incendiary topic in the movements of recent years, whether relating to misogyny, race or homophobia.
To some, it's a new way to flag past wrongs. To others, it's an ineffective over-reaction in the court of public opinion. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, some see the dethroning of historical figures associated with racism as the latest iteration of cancel culture.
On Tuesday, a group of..."
"More than 1 million deceased Americans received stimulus payments totaling over $1 billion, according to a government watchdog agency in a report released to Congress on Thursday.
The payments were granted under the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to help tide Americans over as the pandemic ripped through the country and forced the economy to a halt. The payments totaled as much as $1,200 to individual taxpayers and $2,400 for married couples filing jointly. The government granted an additional $500 per qualifying child under the age of 17."
"The Internal Revenue Service sent out 1.1 million stimulus checks to dead people totaling $1.4 billion, according to a new report from a government watchdog agency.
As the IRS hurried to process direct payments to Americans reeling from the coronavirus outbreak, the Government Accountability Office said the tax agency didn’t use Social Security death records to filter out payments to the deceased."
"Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned Wednesday that China's test of a hypersonic missile is ""very concerning"" and ""very close"" to the kind of ""Sputnik moment"" that triggered the Space Race during the Cold War.
Why it matters: The comments by America's top uniformed general underscore the depths of U.S. concerns about China's rapid military expansion and development of advanced weaponry.
The big picture: In 1957, the Soviet Union's stunning launch of the Sputnik satellite raised alarms that the U.S. was falling behind in a technology race.
The..."
"Students walked out of classes at schools across Loudoun County, Va., on Tuesday in solidarity with victims of sexual assault in response to two recent incidents in the school district, Fox 5 D.C. reported. 
On Monday, a judge found a teenage suspect guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl in a bathroom at Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn in May, according to The Washington Post. 
The same perpetrator allegedly assaulted a student at Broad Run High School in Ashburn on Oct. 6, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. The judge said sentencing over the May incident would depend on the outcome..."
"Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s Democratic election chief who built a national profile by standing up to false claims about the 2020 presidential election, has won the state’s race for governor.
The Associated Press, NBC News and CNN called the race for Hobbs shortly after 7 p.m. Monday, following a nail-biter week of election returns that highlighted the competitiveness of politics in the state.
""Democracy is worth the wait,"" Hobbs posted on social media before issuing a statement thanking her family, volunteers and staff for their work.
""This was not just about an..."
"U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package in March contributed to stronger demand but is only a small factor in current higher rates of inflation, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday.
Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee that the stimulus package clearly boosted demand but said it was not a ""fair assumption"" to say it overshot the need and fueled current spikes in inflation.
""It's certainly true that the American Rescue Plan put money in people's pockets ... and contributed to strong demand in the..."
"Introducing himself as the U.S.’s first Kenyan-American president, Barack Obama sought to use his unlikely success story and personal ties to his father’s homeland to inspire a country he described as “at a crossroads.”
Mr. Obama, in a speech on Sunday before several thousand Kenyans at an indoor sports arena, said Kenya is caught between intensifying security concerns over the spread of terrorism and the promise of a democracy wi"
"A summons charging former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo with misdemeanor forcible touching was prematurely issued by Albany City Court on Thursday after a sheriff's investigator filed paperwork with the court summarizing their investigation and seeking to begin the process of obtaining a criminal complaint.
No final decision had been made by the sheriff's department or the Albany County district attorney's office on whether to formally file charges, according to sources familiar with the matter. But a spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration confirmed that a misdemeanor complaint against..."
"The Trump administration is shattering a gruesome record on its way out, executing more federal prisoners in a matter of months — including two this week — than over the past several decades combined.
Why it matters: President-elect Biden opposes the death penalty and has said he wants to end its use. New U.S. presidents can undo many of their predecessors' actions, but executions are uniquely irreversible.
Driving the news: Alfred Bourgeois, 56, was scheduled to be executed early Friday for torturing and killing his 2-year-old daughter."
"STOCKHOLM/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Swedish activist Greta Thunberg joined calls for a combined effort to tackle coronavirus and the climate crisis, saying the 50th anniversary of Earth Day on Wednesday was the time to choose a “new way forward”.
Dramatic improvements in air and water quality as coronavirus lockdowns have cut pollution have prompted calls for a low-carbon future, but the need to get millions back to work is clouding the environmental picture.
With economies round the world shut down, wildlife has returned to city streets, with wolves, deer and kangaroos..."
"Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) defended her support for cost-of-living increases for members of Congress on Tuesday, saying her position will help keep dark money out of politics.
She said voting against a cost-of-living increase can ""sound nice"" but doing so makes campaign finance reform harder. She added it serves to ""punish members who rely on a straight salary, and reward those who rely on money loopholes and other forms of self-dealing.""
""It’s not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important,"" she tweeted. ""ALL..."
"Senate Republican centrists are calling on Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) to postpone a key vote on a bipartisan infrastructure package until Monday to give negotiators more time to reach a deal.
Schumer has scheduled a procedural vote on a motion to begin debate on the infrastructure package for Wednesday, and Republicans say he will not have the 60 votes needed to proceed.
“My hope is that Sen. Schumer will agree to postpone the vote. We’re making significant progress,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)."
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen argued for a global minimum corporate tax rate Monday, as she makes the case for President Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal ahead of virtual meetings with global counterparts this week.
“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” she said in remarks to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Monday. “It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises,..."
"The word was spread throughout the day on Tuesday, that Google had taken some sort of action to demote leading politically conservative websites in its search results. Newsbusters alleged Tuesday that Google “has seemingly blacklisted numerous conservative websites,” listing Breitbart, The Washington Free Beacon, The Blaze, The Daily Wire and other top sites on the right.
Another reporter, Charlie Nash of Mediaite, posted about this as well, while also noting that some left-wing sites had also apparently disappeared from results.
By Tuesday night, the sites had all been..."
"President Biden mounted an ardent defense of his decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, standing by the plan amid rapid gains by the insurgent Taliban, signs of strain on the Afghan military and grim forecasts from U.S. military and intelligence officials.
Mr. Biden said Thursday that the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan is on track to end on Aug. 31, arguing that the U.S. had achieved the objectives it set out two decades ago and adding that his administration would move thousands of potentially endangered Afghan interpreters..."
"The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it soon will begin reducing the pace of its monthly bond purchases, the first step toward pulling back on the massive amount of help it had been providing markets and the economy.
Tapering of bond purchases will start “later this month,” the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said in its post-meeting statement. The process will see reductions of $15 billion each month -- $10 billion in Treasurys and $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities – from the current $120 billion a month that the Fed is..."
"President Biden announced on Monday that he intends to nominate Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.
Driving the news: The U.S. has not had an ambassador to Ukraine since former President Trump removed Marie Yovanovitch from the position in 2019.
The big picture: The White House's announcement follows Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the first time top U.S. officials have traveled to Ukraine since the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion.
Blinken announced during the visit that U.S. diplomats would return..."
"A proposal for Chicago Public Schools to resume in-person classes Wednesday has been approved by the Chicago Teachers Union’s House of Delegates following a contentious weeklong standoff.
The delegates also voted Monday night to suspend the union’s work action that saw teachers refuse to give their lessons in person, prompting the cancellation of the last four school days. There will be no Tuesday classes though teachers will report to schools for planning.
In addition to a return to in-person teaching Wednesday, the plan the House of Delegates approved will set..."
"Donald Trump Jr. wrote about a trip to Arlington National Cemetery just before President Trump’s inauguration in his newly released book, where he reflected on his family’s sacrifices since his father took office.
Then-President-elect Trump and the first family were at the cemetery the day before Trump’s inauguration in January of 2017. Trump laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where unidentified soldiers from World War I, World War II and the Korean War are buried in crypts.

""We have come to an agreement,"" Schumer told reporters after more than two hours of closed-door talks that included Senate Budget Committee Democrats and White House officials. Republicans have not been part of these negotiations.
""You add that to the $600 billion in a bipartisan plan..."
"Top Senate Democrats are urging Vice President Pence to abandon plans to preside over Monday's vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court after several of his aides tested positive for the coronavirus.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and members of his leadership team sent a letter to Pence saying that in the wake of the recent coronavirus cases, presiding over the vote ""is not a risk worth taking.""
""Not only would your presence in the Senate Chamber tomorrow be a clear violation of Centers for..."
"Washington is full of ideas on how to fix the fully loaded SUV known as Obamacare. On Thursday, President Obama offered his fix. On Friday, members of the House – including 39 Democrats – approved theirs, and other lawmakers have their own ideas. But all these busy mechanics could end up doing more damage to Obamacare."
"A vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill was delayed late Thursday night as leaders on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue continue to hash out a deal on President Biden's larger reconciliation package.
Why it matters: Pelosi had promised centrist Democrats she would bring the Senate-passed measure to the floor today, and spent hours negotiating with members in order to fulfill her pledge.
But progressive Democrats stayed firm in their threat to sink the vote without a detailed commitment between the House, Senate and White House that Biden's reconciliation package..."
"The United States Supreme Court will not take up Boise’s appeal in the case of Martin v. Boise, which addresses whether the city can ticket homeless people for “camping” in public, filings showed Monday.
Advocates for people who are homeless considered the decision a victory as news came down. Theane Evangelis, Boise’s lead counsel on the case, disagreed, saying in a statement that “the Ninth Circuit’s decision ultimately harms the very people it purports to protect.”"
"During a Wednesday press briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she opposes placing a ban on congressional lawmakers and their spouses from trading stock, saying ""We're a free market economy,"" and that they ""should be able to participate in that.""
The issue of members of Congress trading in stock has been a point of contention in recent months, as a December 14 report by Insider identified that 49 members of Congress had failed to adequately report their financial transactions as dictated under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK..."
"The White House and union leaders are using Labor Day reinvigorate efforts to raise the minimum wage.
Legislation to increase the federal pay floor from $7.25 an hour stalled in Congress this spring, but Democrats hope the issue will resonate with voters in November, especially in states with closely contested Senate races.
“Raising the minimum wage would be one of the best ways to give a boost to working families,” President Barack Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio address. He pointed to stronger job creation gains this year but..."
"Despite pressure from the left, Joe Biden is making it clear that if he wins, he won't just pull up stakes from Afghanistan and the region.
Driving the news: Biden made news on Thursday when he told Stars and Stripes that he supports a sustained U.S. military footprint of up to 1,500-2,000 on the ground — primarily for special operations against ISIS and other terror threats — in the war that began after the 9/11 terrorist attacks 19 years ago.
""These forever wars have to end ... but here's the..."
"US President Donald Trump has outlined his ""strongly pro-life"" views on abortion amid controversy over strict new laws passed in several states.
Mr Trump said he was against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a ""serious health risk"" to the mother.
His stance on what is a divisive election issue in the US emerged days after Alabama passed a law banning abortion in almost all cases.
A pro-choice rally is planned later on Sunday in protest at the new measures."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, a long-awaited development that public health officials hope will persuade some people who remain hesitant about the vaccine to get the shot.
The vaccine is the first of the pandemic vaccines used in the United States to transition from emergency use status to full licensure, a major victory for a partnership that decided to forgo funding through the government’s Operation Warp Speed program on the belief that the development..."
"A few miles from the Las Vegas Strip, in a working-class neighborhood of one-story homes and scattered palm trees, Vania Oronoz is pushing her husband to give up his habit of voting for Democrats.
Mrs. Oronoz and many of her neighbors are shifting toward the Republican Party, a pattern that’s being replicated across the country. The move has been especially pronounced among working-class Latinos, whose votes have the potential to reshape the political parties in the same way that the movement of white, working-class voters has made them a pillar..."
"Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will retire, NBC news first reported on Wednesday, giving President Biden his first — and maybe only — chance to put a stamp on the high court.
What’s next: Appointing a new Supreme Court justice will be one of the longest-lasting pieces of Biden’s legacy — and could give Democrats a jolt of energy ahead of next year's midterms.
Why it matters: Breyer, who is 83, faced considerable pressure to step aside under a Democratic president and while Democrats control the Senate, even narrowly.
Breyer’s retirement won’t help Democrats..."
"Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called Sen. John McCain on Tuesday to discuss his interest in running for the presidency, the Arizona Republican said Tuesday.
“He told me that he’s seriously considering it, and we discussed issues and friendships and things like that,” Mr. McCain, the Republican Party’s 2008 presidential nominee, told reporters. “We had a long conversation. We’re very good friends.”
Mr. McCain said he was “open” to supporting Mr. Romney, who last week told a group of donors he was considering a run for the White House in..."
"Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Thursday it would stop accepting new political ads in the week before the U.S. election day on Nov. 3, in a series of moves the company billed as its final plan for reducing risks of misinformation and election interference.
Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, will continue to allow campaigns and others to run political ads that are already in the system, and will permit them to change spending amounts and user targeting, but will block adjustments to the ads’ content or design.
The company..."
"Facebook Inc.’s first action to limit political advertising in the U.S. with a ban of news ads in the week preceding the Nov. 3 elections announced Thursday comes amid unrelenting criticism that its platform fuels misinformation and is a haven for far-right groups.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who in particular has taken heat for political manipulation of the social-media company’s platform during the 2016 U.S. elections, made the announcement early Thursday in another attempt to tamp down meddling.
“It’s important that campaigns can run ‘get out the vote campaigns’, and..."
"Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled their bill to reform the police, the latest effort by lawmakers to overhaul U.S. law enforcement in the face of unrelenting pressure from activists in the wake of George Floyd’s death.
Here’s some of what the Republicans’ bill would do:
Incentivize law enforcement agencies to ban the use of chokeholds by tying funding to whether departments have prohibited the practice “except when deadly force is authorized”;
Ramp up data collection efforts to track when an officer’s use of force results in death or serious..."
"The government has U-turned on plans to scrap the 45p rate of income tax for higher earners.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC the proposals, announced just 10 days ago, had become ""a massive distraction on what was a strong package"".
""We just talked to people, we listened to people, I get it,"" he added.
The decision, which marks a humiliating climbdown for Prime Minister Liz Truss, comes after several Tory MPs criticised the plan.
On Sunday, Ms Truss had said she was committed to the policy.
The plan to..."
"Texas State Sen. Roland Gutierrez (D) is suing the state’s Department of Public Safety (DPS) for denying him records relating to last month’s Uvalde elementary school shooting.
The senator announced Wednesday he is suing the department after filing an open records request asking for information authorities have obtained about the deadly Robb Elementary School shooting, which left 21 people dead. 
Gutierrez said he filed the request on May 31, with the department having 10 days by law to respond to the request.
The Department of Public Safety has not sought..."
"The Obama administration declassified and released documents Wednesday that described past violations of a secret court order by National Security Agency programs set up to amass records on phone calls and Internet transactions.
The violations weren't detailed in the three documents, but raised new concerns about the sweeping surveillance operations and opened the administration to new criticism from advocates of stricter limits.
The documents also posed questions about why the NSA closed one of the programs, to collect so-called metadata on email and other Internet communications. A 2011 document called..."
"These are the signs of our times.
Young people and adults around the world skipped school and work for the global climate strike on Friday, which is expected to be the largest such demonstration to date with 4,638 events scheduled in 139 countries.
Sixteen-year-old Swedish climate advocate Greta Thunberg and other “Fridays for Future” activists organized the worldwide walkout to raise awareness about climate change. The Fridays for Future site says that “with the worsening climate destruction this goal of going to school begins to be pointless. Why study for..."
"A Harvard University professor has been convicted of hiding ties to a China-run recruitment programme.
Charles Lieber was found guilty of making false statements to authorities, filing false tax returns and failing to report a Chinese bank account. His sentencing date is yet to be decided.
The 62-year-old was charged in 2020 as part of a US campaign to counter economic espionage from China.
However, some critics say this campaign harms academic research.
Prosecutors in Boston said Lieber knowingly hid his involvement in China's ""Thousand Talents Plan"", which aims to..."
"The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump was set to vote to recommend holding his final chief of staff in criminal contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena.

"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week shared recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, which — alongside mandates to boost vaccination rates — will help get the pandemic back under control as the second COVID-19 winter looms. 
These recommendations — and the underlying evidence of vaccine effectiveness and durability — are good news more or less across the board, despite the concerns of those who oppose boosters so long as global vaccination rates remain low.
The FDA and CDC drew..."
"In a video address on Sept. 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization. It will primarily target the Russian Armed Forces' reserve personnel. ""Mobilization measures will begin today,"" Putin said.
In his speech, Putin once again called Kyiv ""fascist,"" said it was Ukraine that invaded Russia in 2014, and hinted that Moscow would annex Russian-occupied territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Putin once again saber rattled, adding that using nuclear arms remains an option for the Kremlin.
""When its territorial integrity is threatened, Russia will use..."
"The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Thursday moved a step closer to confirming President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court choice Amy Coney Barrett, with the Judiciary Committee scheduling an Oct. 22 vote on her nomination despite Democratic objections. The fourth and final day of the committee’s confirmation hearing for the conservative appellate judge wrapped up with testimony from outside experts. Democrats protested what they called the rushed nature of the proceedings and complained that Barrett had sidestepped questions about presidential powers, abortion, climate change, voting rights and Obamacare.
Republicans are aiming..."
"House Republicans planning to take control of the chamber in this year’s midterms are weighing how much of a priority to make examining election systems and laws. 
Some conservatives, particularly the most vocal of Trump supporters, are pointing to perceived issues in the 2020 election that they think deserve attention.  
But GOP leaders are already set to spend considerable time and energy on an avalanche of planned investigations and probes on other issues, and some in the party are wary of relitigating 2020 election fraud claims rather than conducting..."
"New polls show former Vice President Joe Biden running strong in states President Trump must win to secure a second term, but the race is close in Florida and tightening in Arizona, raising pressure on the Democratic nominee ahead of the first presidential debate.
Biden has several pathways to victory, with new surveys showing him neck and neck with Trump in traditionally red states, such as Texas and Georgia, and in states Trump won comfortably in 2016, like Iowa and Ohio.
The Democratic nominee continues to run up the score..."
"Civics education continues to be a polarizing issue in American culture. But according to Shawn Healy, Senior Director of Policy and Advocacy at the education nonprofit iCivics, “the bias in our education system is not ideological.” As Healy sees it, “the problem is that outside of a few pockets, civics education is not universally offered in a high-quality way.”
He hopes that a recent move in the Senate will help strengthen the teaching of civics and U.S. history. On June 14, a group of bipartisan lawmakers led by Sens. Chris..."
"On the surface, American politics appears to be full of paradoxes. In 2016, many women — and especially white Christian women — voted for Donald Trump over the first woman nominated for U.S. president by a major party. Now, in 2020, confirmation hearings are occurring for a woman, nominated by Trump, who opposes a woman’s right to choose abortion. How might those women who voted for Trump feel about these hearings that reopen questions about women’s autonomy over their own bodies?
A further seeming paradox can provide context for..."
"C-Span anchor Steve Scully, who was set to moderate the second presidential debate before it was canceled, was suspended indefinitely by the outlet for falsely claiming that his Twitter account had been hacked.
Mr. Scully, an executive producer and political editor at C-Span, posted a tweet last week directed at former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, asking him whether he should respond to President Trump, who earlier had called Mr. Scully a “never Trumper” in an interview with Fox News.
In a statement released by C-Span Networks Thursday, Mr...."
"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would inject $25bn (£19bn) into the Postal Service (USPS) ahead of November's election.
The legislation would also block cuts and changes that critics have said will hamper mail-in voting.
Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi recalled lawmakers from the summer recess to vote on the bill, which she said would protect the USPS.
After the vote, President Trump tweeted the measure was a Democrat ballot scam.
""Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will..."
"The Harris County Libertarian Party is hosting an event that attempts to get Jo Jorgensen on the debate stage against President Donald Trump and democratic challenger Joe Biden.
On Saturday, Aug. 8, at 11:30 a.m., protesters meet for Let Her Speak at 2706 White Oak Drive, Houston. The group will decorate their cars, “go live” on social media and drive through the Heights and Montrose areas in a bid to get Jorgensen to Cleveland on Sept. 29 for the next presidential debate."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has called for the expulsion of any member of Congress who helped plan the storming of the U.S. Capitol after a bombshell report alleged that several Republican lawmakers had co-ordinated with rally organizers.
""Any member of Congress who helped plot a terrorist attack on our nation's capitol must be expelled,"" the New York congresswoman wrote in a tweet late on Sunday night.
Her comment came after a Rolling Stone report, published on Sunday night, claimed multiple members of Congress had been ""intimately involved"" in the planning of former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn..."
"Solar companies and their investors hailed the Biden administration's move to jolt the U.S. solar industry with a new order that both temporarily removes tariffs on imports and bolsters domestic manufacturers.
Why it matters: Solar installations were expected to fall by 7% in 2022, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, as the industry faced supply concerns triggered by the prospect of retroactive penalties applied to previously imported products.
The Commerce Department announced in late March that it was investigating whether Chinese solar manufacturers improperly circumvented duties by subsidizing production in several southeast Asia..."
"After weeks of escalating trade tensions with the U.S., China modulated its rhetoric, suggesting negotiations remain a priority and laying out conditions for doing so.
A government policy paper on trade issues with the U.S. released Sunday accused Washington of scuttling the negotiations, which broke down in all but name last month. It said the Trump administration’s “America First” program and use of tariffs are harming the global economy and that China wouldn’t shy away from a trade war if need be."
"A record 3.28 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the new coronavirus hit the U.S. economy, marking the end of a decadelong job expansion.
The number of Americans filing for claims was nearly five times the previous record high. Workers seeking jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, increased by 3 million for the week ended March 21, from the prior week.
States reporting large increases included Pennsylvania, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Ohio. Many U.S. businesses have announced layoffs and several state and local authorities ordered nonessential..."
"The House passed a bill on Thursday to nationalize red flag laws, which seek to keep guns away from individuals deemed a threat to themselves and others.
The legislation, dubbed the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order, passed in a 224-202 vote. Two Republicans did not vote.
Five Republicans — Reps. Fred Upton (Mich.), Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.) and Chris Jacobs (N.Y.) — bucked the GOP in voting for the measure, and Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (Maine) broke from the party in opposing the bill."
"Bernie Sanders has cemented his status as the Democratic front-runner to take on Donald Trump in November's US presidential election.
He is projected to win Nevada's caucuses, and early results suggest he is on course for a large victory.
There is a long way to go, however, until a nominee is confirmed.
Early results also suggest former vice-president Joe Biden has performed better in Nevada than in the other two states which have voted so far.
He had underwhelming results in Iowa and New Hampshire. Those states kicked off the..."
"President Trump outlined his ambitions for health care policy in a North Carolina speech Thursday, promising ""the highest standard of care anywhere in the world,"" before signing an executive order guaranteeing protections for pre-existing conditions and then pledging to ban surprise medical bills.
Reality check: The only reason that pre-existing conditions protections are at risk is because a Trump-backed lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act is pending before the Supreme Court. Trump's executive order offers few details, and executive orders in and of themselves don't change policy. The order ""simply..."
"Chris Krebs knew his mission this year was to protect the integrity of the US election - but he might not have predicted the way that would cost him his job.
For well over a year, Mr Krebs and his cyber-security team had been gaming scenarios about what could go wrong. At one point, he said his greatest fear was that voter registration databases might be interfered with to stop people voting.
He also talked about the concern that on election night, media organisations might be hacked to prevent people..."
"(Survey among economic experts) Public school students would receive a higher quality education if they all had the option of taking the government money (local, state, federal) currently being spent on their own education and turning that money into vouchers that they could use towards covering the costs of any private school or public school of their choice (e.g. charter schools)."
"The International Monetary Fund is now less optimistic about the global economy for 2021, but still sees reasonable growth over the medium term. 
In its World Economic Outlook, published Tuesday, the Fund said it expects global gross domestic product to grow by 5.9% this year — 0.1 percentage point lower than its July estimate. For next year, the IMF has kept its global growth projection at 4.9%.
The revised outlook for this year comes amid supply chain issues in advanced economies and a worsening health situation in emerging countries."
"Journalist Glenn Greenwald, a co-founder of The Intercept, argued on Monday that media censorship had overstepped a line in its attempts to prevent domestic terrorism.
Appearing on Hill.TV's ""Rising"" on Monday, Greenwald opined that the proposed legislative response to the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6 was not necessary as the legal infrastructure to combat it already existed in the U.S.
Greenwald pointed to the response after the 9/11 terrorist attack where several laws expanded the definition of supporting terrorism. People, particularly Muslims, who disagreed on U.S. foreign policy and..."
"Stephanie Flynn had planned to travel from Boston to Italy with her mom to celebrate her 30th birthday. It was April 2020, and the trip didn’t happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither did their rescheduled getaway last September. Finally, with the world opening up this past spring, Flynn—fully vaccinated—made a third attempt to book her Italy trip, aiming for a September departure.
Then the Delta variant numbers started to creep up in July. 
With fewer than two weeks to go before her departure, Flynn reached out to her travel agent, who expressed no concerns. Less..."
"This morning, YouTube, which is owned by Google, removed a video created by Project Veritas, a nonprofit founded by conservative James O’Keefe that is dedicated to exposing corruption. The video showed undercover footage of Google executive Jen Gennai discussing the tech giant’s search algorithm. Some of those on the right say Gennai’s comments confirm Google is biased and that the search giant is taking a role in shaping elections. As of Tuesday evening, the story is largely being ignored by media outlets on the left. Overall, the controversy raises concerns..."
"ed an open letter that decried cable news in general as a “cancer” that “risks human lives.”
Pekary’s letter went viral Monday night, August 3, when she posted it publicly. In it, she said she had wanted to quit working at MSNBC for at least two years but was advised to “stick it out” until a number of different benchmarks. It took the coronavirus pandemic and the media’s involvement in it to inspire her to quit on July 24, she said."
"As news of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's arrival in Taiwan has lit up the headlines, I've been hit by a virtual tidal wave of messages from well-meaning acquaintances in the West who are genuinely worried for my safety.
Meanwhile, the biggest drama in my Taiwanese family's group chat currently is how I missed my car's annual smog check appointment and how a cockroach infestation has sprung up in my Taipei bedroom while I've been away on vacation.
Sometimes I find myself toggling between two alternate realities -- one submerged in existential dread..."
"President Biden’s longtime discomfort with the issue of abortion, fueled by his Catholicism and his personal and complex stance on access, has come under scrunity this week with the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that shows a majority of justices supporting the reversal of Roe v. Wade.
The president is often criticized for attempting to balance his faith with his support for abortion access. But Biden hasn’t publicaly used the word abortion out loud during his presidency until this week and he also hasn’t called for an end to the..."
"Fox News's Chris Wallace informed viewers on Sunday that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign said the former vice president was ""not available"" for an interview after President Trump said Biden couldn't handle tough questioning from the ""Fox News Sunday"" host.

"Western countries have condemned Belarus for diverting a plane flying over its territory to arrest an opposition journalist.
EU leaders are due to discuss their response to what the union's executive called a ""hijacking"" and the US state department said was ""a shocking act"".
Belarus scrambled a fighter jet to force the plane - bound for Lithuania - to land, claiming a bomb threat.

"Partisan legislators across the country have been busy manipulating district lines to bolster their party's chances of controlling the House next year, according to analysis of maps by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project and RepresentUs.
By the numbers: Nineteen states have now finished the redistricting process, and Georgia, New Mexico and Virginia are awaiting only a final signature on their plans. The Redistricting Report Card project has released grades for seven of these 22 maps. Five received an F.
Six of the remaining 28 states do not have congressional redistricting, as they..."
"States across the West are finalizing their new election district maps for the next decade based on 2020 U.S. Census data, and their decisions will have far-reaching consequences.
In California, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes announced he won’t seek reelection after redistricting put him in a much more competitive district, exchanging a shot at the chairmanship of the influential House Ways and Means Committee to work for former President Donald Trump’s new media company. In Oregon, where Democrats control the redistricting process, they reduced the number of competitive districts for Republicans, while Utah..."
"KABUL (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday carried out its first air strike on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan since the two sides signed a troop withdrawal agreement on Saturday.
A U.S. forces spokesman confirmed the incident in southern Helmand province, hours after President Donald Trump spoke by phone with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund on Tuesday, the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official.
The Taliban fighters “were actively attacking an (Afghan National Security Forces) checkpoint. This was a defensive strike to disrupt..."
"Billionaire libertarian megadonors Charles and David Koch, long associated with support for Republicans and the right wing of American politics, are funding an effort to praise members of both parties working to find a permanent solution for the “Dreamers.” The move is a rebuff to President Donald Trump and the congressional leadership, who are trying to quell a moderate rebellion on immigration within their own party."
"The Democratic-led House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday released the Trump administration’s legal justification for its Jan. 2 drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
Echoing arguments administration officials have made in public, the two-page memo cites a president’s constitutional authority to protect national interests from an attack, as well as the 2002 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) that was passed to authorize the Iraq War."
"The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump will begin next month after an agreement reached between Senate Democrats and Republicans.
House Democrats will send the impeachment article of ""inciting insurrection"" to the Senate on Monday.
Arguments will not begin until the week of 8 February, allowing Mr Trump's lawyers two weeks to build a defence.
Democrats accuse the ex-president of instigating the deadly 6 January riot at the US Capitol.
The House of Representatives last week charged Mr Trump with inciting the Capitol violence, paving the way for a Senate..."
"The rate of U.S. inflation topped 8% in March for the first time in more than four decades and showed little sign of easing up, explaining the new-found urgency at the Federal Reserve to quickly undo its easy-money strategy.
The consumer price index jumped 1.2% in the month, driven by the higher cost of gasoline, food and housing,  the government said Tuesday. It was the largest monthly gain since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The increase exceeded Wall Street’s forecast of a 1.1% advance.
The rise in the cost of living has..."
"Former President Donald Trump's lawyers on Wednesday sought to downplay the federal government's discovery of highly classified records inside his Florida estate, telling a judge that presidential records by their very nature are sensitive.
The filing comes just one day before Trump's legal team will square off against the U.S. Justice Department in a federal court in West Palm Beach, in a bid by Trump to convince U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to appoint a special master to review the materials seized by the FBI from his home on Aug...."

Mr. de Blaiso, who has come under intense scrutiny for his support for protesters and a deteriorating relationship with police unions, said the city’s focus should shift to the grieving families of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.
Police unions have partly laid blame..."
"President Biden on Monday reiterated warnings that the Russian government is ""exploring options for potential cyberattacks.""
The big picture: The Biden administration has previously warned that the Russian government may pursue malicious cyber activity in response to U.S. economic sanctions against Russia for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
Driving the news: Biden urged the private sector to ""harden your cyber defenses immediately,"" according to a White House statement."
"Democratic hopes are on a knife-edge in the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania, where both parties hold their primaries Tuesday.
On one hand, Democrats believe Republican voters could do them an unintentional favor in whomever they choose as their nominee. 
The top tier of the GOP field is comprised of TV personality Mehmet Oz, conservative commentator Kathy Barnette and businessman David McCormick — all of whom Democrats believe have potentially fatal flaws.
On the other hand, the shock has not yet faded in Democratic circles that the clear front-runner in their Senate primary,..."
"WASHINGTON—U.S. employers added jobs at a robust pace in June, easing fears of a hiring slowdown and showing a strong labor market could propel a domestic economy facing threats from abroad.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 224,000 in June, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate last month ticked up to 3.7% in part because more Americans entered the labor force to look for a job. Wages advanced 3.1% from a year earlier, consistent with the prior month’s pace.
Hiring was stronger than expected. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street..."
"Far-right activists have unleashed a torrent of threatening calls and emails against Boston Children's Hospital over its health care services for transgender youth — the latest in a broad effort against those who offer gender-affirming care.
Driving the news: The hospital is boosting security and working with law enforcement after receiving a barrage of online complaints and threats about its program for treating trans and nonbinary youth.
The program also offers genital surgeries for patients ages 18 and up. Far-right influencers and their followers are falsely claiming doctors are performing these surgeries on..."
"Many news media, political activists and social media giants have gotten on the bandwagon that voter fraud is fiction. It is not.
A review of court cases and recent indictments – including one this week in Philadelphia against a former congressman – finds there have been at least four dozen cases in criminal and civil court since the last presidential election in 2016 in which voter fraud has led to charges, convictions, lawsuits or plea deals.
The schemes have ranged from old fashion ballot box stuffing to absentee and..."
"The top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, on Friday added his voice to those criticizing the Obama administrations decision to bring former al Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith to New York for trial in federal court.
In a written statement, Mr. McConnell said Mr. Abu Ghaith, a son in law of Osama bin Laden, should have been placed in military custody at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. “At Guantanamo, he could be held as a detainee and fulsomely and continuously interrogated without having to..."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said she is “not ready” to be Speaker but lamented that the Democratic party desperately needs new leadership and that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) need to go.
In an interview with The Intercept’s podcast, the progressive hero and firebrand said that Democrats have failed to create a succession plan once Pelosi and her generation of longtime leaders — many of them now in their eighties — step aside. Pelosi has indicated that this upcoming two-year term will be her..."
"Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social network's decision not to send speech from politicians to third-party fact-checkers, a move that's drawn scrutiny, especially from Democrats in the US.
""I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true,"" Zuckerberg said during a nearly 40-minute speech at Georgetown University.
The remarks highlight the social network's controversial approach to political speech as it tries to strike a balance between free speech..."
"Activists across France have staged Black Friday protests against Amazon, decrying consumerism and its impact on the environment.
Dozens of protesters gathered outside the company's French headquarters in Clichy, north of Paris.

In response, Amazon told the BBC it respected..."
"In a year when the coronavirus has racked up an unbearable death toll, recent preliminary data from the federal government suggests an overlap with another staggering figure: More Americans died from drug overdose in a 12-month period than at any other point in history.
While the vaccination of more than 1 million Americans in recent days is buoying hope that health officials could be gaining a foothold over the pandemic, the same can’t be said for the opioid crisis, which has been killing people for far longer than COVID-19 and..."
"A U.S. army ad went viral last weekend after a Twitter user spliced it together with a Russian army ad to show a difference in the tone and messaging. Two AllSides writers, one from the left and one from the right, share opposing perspectives on the ad below.
The Russian ad shows physically fit men waking up at the crack of dawn, doing pushups, shooting guns and jumping out of airplanes. (We don’t speak Russian, so we’re not sure what it says.) Meanwhile, the American ad is a colorful cartoon telling the story of..."
"Britain has become the latest European country to lockdown as the U.K. government announced a raft of restrictions preventing the population from leaving home apart from four exceptions.
There is now a blanket travel restriction, and police will have powers to fine or disperse people who venture onto the street for any other reason than to buy food, address any medical need, travel to a workplace for essential work, or undertake daily exercise. These steps come as the U.K. death toll rose to 335.
All shops selling nonessential goods have..."
"Ayman al-Zawahiri was an intellectual driving force of al-Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden’s successor as the Islamist group’s leader since 2011. His death in a US strike in Kabul brings justice of sorts for the families of victims of a string of terrorist atrocities including the 9/11 attacks on the US. It demonstrates America’s ability to continue to mount “over-the-horizon” counter-terrorism operations, nearly a year after the ignominious US withdrawal from Afghanistan. But it may do little in itself to hamper the operational capabilities of al-Qaeda, or reduce the risk..."
"President Barack Obama touted the benefits of the Affordable Care Act Thursday to a skeptical public as part of an effort to build support for the health law in the face of continued Republican efforts to block it.
Speaking at the White House, Mr. Obama said people across the country have gotten rebates from their health-insurance companies that they can use to pay other bills and support their families."
"Early voting is exactly what it sounds like - it's where people are allowed to vote before the scheduled election day.
This can be either in-person at early voting stations, or absentee - that is, by post. In-person early voting is common in Finland and Canada, while Switzerland, Germany and the UK accept postal votes.
In the US, this means people are able to cast their ballots before 3 November - either by post or in-person.
Early voting has steadily increased with each election year. The number of people who..."
"President Joe Biden on Monday appointed longtime biologist and former government scientist Renee Wegrzyn as the first director of the nascent Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.
Biden’s announcement comes as ARPA-H advocates debate where the multibillion-dollar agency should be headquartered and which elusive disease areas should be prioritized. The president officially launched the agency in March with $1 billion in initial funding allotted by Congress, but the search for its inaugural director has taken months."
"Stocks fell sharply, bond yields rose and the dollar strengthened Friday as investors heeded the Federal Reserve’s signal that its battle with inflation could result in much higher interest rates and a recession.
The sell-off Friday was global, in a week where the Fed boosted rates by another three-quarters of a point and other central banks raised their own interest rates to combat global inflation trends."
"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday escalated his ongoing feud with the nation's top infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci about the role the National Institutes of Health (NIH) played in funding controversial research in Wuhan, China.
The two traded barbs during a tense exchange, triggering a shouting match in which Fauci accused Paul of lying in order to further his agenda. 
During a Senate Health Committee hearing about the federal COVID-19 response, Paul said the NIH funded illegal gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which created a highly dangerous and transmissible virus..."
"In our world where agreement, especially among the politically fractured media, is rare, there seems to be a general consensus on one thing: President Joe Biden is governing further left than expected. From The New York Times on the left to the National Review on the right, the press is in general agreement.
But is Biden uniting or dividing the country while he moves left?
Biden’s inaugural address sounded notes of unity, but historically that has been a standard feature for new presidents, with the noted exception of President Donald..."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled in secret Sunday to the city of Neom on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast for a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Israeli sources told me.
The latest: Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan on Monday denied the meeting took place — a signal that the Saudis may be unhappy with the leak or are at least trying to publicly distance themselves from the meeting. Netanyahu, on the other hand, has not denied the story."
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top U.S. health official cautioned on Thursday that protests sweeping across the country could increase the spread of the novel coronavirus, particularly in cities that have struggled to control the outbreak, and that participants should “highly consider” getting tested.

Protests have occurred in Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., where there has..."
"Donald Trump reached out to veterans at a biker rally in front of the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday afternoon, drawing applause as he promised to pay for private health care and to announce new donations to veterans groups.

"Today I sent my intention to resign from The Intercept, the news outlet I co-founded in 2013 with Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras, as well as from its parent company First Look Media.
The final, precipitating cause is that The Intercept’s editors, in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I remove all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New-York-based Intercept editors involved in this effort at suppression.

"Leading infectious-diseases official said on CNN that the U.S. ‘could have saved more lives’ if it had moved faster
President Trump stoked questions about the fate of Dr. Anthony Fauci after retweeting a critic who called for the member of the White House’s coronavirus task force to be fired after he said lives could have been saved if the government had acted more quickly.
Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has drawn denunciations from some on the right who have questioned his advice..."
"The Biden administration plans to cancel all outstanding student loans for those who attended schools operated by Corinthian Colleges, formerly one of the largest for-profit education companies, the U.S. Department of Education announced Wednesday.
The schools have been accused of predatory and unlawful practices, and faced lawsuits from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as Vice President Kamala Harris when she was attorney general of California. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015.
Around 560,000 borrowers stand to benefit from the debt cancellation, which will come out to around $5.8 billion. That’s the..."
"Elizabeth Warren is suspending her campaign after a poor performance on Super Tuesday, as first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by multiple other media outlets.
The state of play: Once thought of as a front-runner, Warren failed to win a single state during the biggest day on the Democratic primary calendar, even coming in third in her home state of Massachusetts behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
Warren was largely a non-factor in the early nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, picking up..."
"Hiring accelerated in March as employers added 916,000 jobs, the Labor Department said Friday, the biggest gain since August. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0%.
The U.S. labor market is poised for a hiring spree that could deliver jobs to the industries, regions and workers hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal project employers will add an average of 514,000 jobs each month over the next year, for a total of more than six million. That would mark the best 12-month stretch of job..."
"Former President Trump on Tuesday voiced support for imposing the death penalty as punishment for convicted drug dealers as part of a speech in which he laid out a series of drastic measures to curb crime.
“The penalties should be very, very severe. If you look at countries throughout the world, the ones that don’t have a drug problem are ones that institute a very quick trial death penalty sentence for drug dealers,” Trump said at the America First Policy Institute. 
“It sounds horrible, doesn’t it? But you know what? That’s the..."
"A U.S. federal judge on Monday rejected a lawsuit by Democrats in the House of Representatives that sought to block President Donald Trump’s plan to divert funds to help build a border wall.
“While the Constitution bestows upon Members of the House many powers, it does not grant them standing to hale the Executive Branch into court claiming a dilution of Congress’s legislative authority. The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear the House’s claims and will deny its motion,” McFadden wrote.
House Democrats had argued diverting the funds violated the..."
Delay in Big-Employer Requirement Raises Questions About Administration's Ability to Implement Overall Policy. When Obama administration officials delayed a central plank of the new health law—requiring that big employers offer health insurance to workers—they said it was to help businesses pleading for more time.
"NIAID director Anthony Fauci, in a fiery exchange with Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday, accused the Kentucky senator of ""making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.""
Driving the news: ""In usual fashion, senator, you are distorting everything about me,"" Fauci said, responding to repeated attacks by Paul during a hearing before the Senate's health panel on the federal response to COVID-19 variants.
Fauci suggested that Paul's repeated attacks on him have led to ""threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children with obscene phone calls because people..."
"Members of the White House press pool lodged a complaint with the White House after British reporters but not American reporters were recognized for questions during President Biden’s meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday afternoon.
White House Correspondents' Association President Steve Portnoy, who served as the radio pooler on Tuesday, said that the editorial component of the pool went to White House press secretary Jen Psaki to lodge a formal complaint on Tuesday about the lack of questions granted to American reporters.
Biden and Johnson each delivered brief remarks in the Oval Office. Johnson..."
"The intelligence community was warning of the danger posed by the novel coronavirus throughout January and February as the White House downplayed the threat and was slow to roll out nationwide measures, reports show.
U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting told The Washington Post that the reports did not clarify when the virus might spread in the U.S. or recommend specific steps to prevent an outbreak, but they did track the international spread of the coronavirus and warn that China was initially dismissing the seriousness of what is now..."
"Wednesday night’s debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will be the most important of its kind since VP debates began 40 years ago. While VP debates see less fanfare than the sparring matches at the top of the ticket, the 2020 races and the unique events surrounding it have made the Pence-Harris faceoff especially newsworthy.
As the president lays in Walter Reed hospital, battling a virus that has already killed 210,000 Americans, we are reminded that the vice president is a heartbeat away from the presidency...."
"US Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett has evaded questions about her views on key issues on day two of her Senate confirmation hearing.
The conservative judge repeatedly refused to be drawn on abortion, healthcare and LGBTQ rights.
She stated she had ""no agenda"" and vowed to stick to ""the rule of law"".
If Judge Barrett passes the committee hearing, the full Senate will vote to confirm or reject her for a lifelong place on the top US court.
Republicans want the confirmation ahead of the presidential election on 3..."
"Some social media users frustrated with the recent leaked opinion from the Supreme Court regarding the potential overturn of Roe v. Wade have called for a Mother's Day Strike.
On Tuesday a leaked draft opinion showed the Supreme Court was preparing to strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark ruling that guarantees abortion rights.
Such a bombshell ruling could instantly make abortion illegal in at least 13 states with legal access to abortion varying widely across the country.
Following the leak, many people took to the streets to protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington. And now, multiple people..."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is bulking up his political team with three veterans of George W. Bush‘s re-election campaign in preparation for a likely presidential bid, and his allies have formally launched a super PAC to amplify the expected campaign.
This burst of activity from the Christie camp comes at a perilous juncture for the New Jersey governor. Polls show his support slipping among Republican primary voters, and the onetime front runner has been overshadowed recently by a pair of potential rivals – former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and..."
"President Joe Biden gave a speech Wednesday about the fight against Covid-19 in the U.S.
The president’s remarks come a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a fourth Covid vaccine shot of Pfizer or Moderna for people ages 50 or older. The CDC also recommended that certain younger people with compromised immune systems should receive a fifth of dose.
Biden received his fourth dose after his speech."
"President Barack Obama came into office with a single, driving foreign-policy principle that shaped his approach to international crises: Avoid another protracted war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed at least 129 people, present Mr. Obama with a fundamental test of whether the approach is sustainable.
With one year in office remaining, the president faces pressure to escalate what is now seen as a global, rather than regional, fight against Islamic State militants, whom France accused of carrying out the attacks. Ho"
"The number of people who identify as Native American or Alaska Native alone grew by 27.1% to 3.7 million people over the last decade, according to the U.S. Census.
Why it matter: The spike in the number of people who solely identify as Native American or Alaska Native mirrors the steady rise of the population since 1890, when Indigenous people were nearly wiped out in the U.S.
The Native American population was reduced to fewer than 250,000 people before the 20th century, following decades of mass extermination, forced boarding schools and..."
"The Trump White House’s decision to block routine actions that would facilitate a transition to a Biden administration has added a new layer of turmoil to an already turbulent time.
But this is the Trump era, when many norms of governance have already fallen by the wayside.
President Donald Trump has yet to concede the Nov. 3 election to former Vice President Joe Biden, whom major media have projected as the winner. In addition, President Trump is encouraging legal challenges to the vote counts in key battleground states,..."
"Celebrities would be doing the Earth a favor if they cut back on private jets, but combating global warming will require bigger systemic changes, not just better personal behavior.
Driving the news: A recent report from Yard, a U.K. marketing firm, found that Taylor Swift's flying habits put her atop the list of celebrity emissions ""offenders"" — and gets at a long-running debate about how much of a difference individual decisions make.
The big picture: Private planes spew a lot of CO2. And this is hardly the first time celebrities..."
"U.S. Democrats and Republicans were near agreement on Monday for extra money to help small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, a top Republican lawmaker said, but he accused Democrats of holding up a deal.
“We could have been done yesterday, but the Democrats continue to hold up, even though we had agreed to all the numbers,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, House minority leader, told Fox News.
President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Republicans were “close” to an agreement with Democrats, who have the majority int he House, and suggested..."
"Anewly released poll heading into Labor Day weekend shows a near-record 71% of Americans approve of labor unions, up from 64% just before the pandemic. Yet that Gallup poll stands in contrast to some raw math: Just 1 in 10 workers on U.S. payrolls are union members, half the level seen four decades ago.
Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, wants to bridge that gap – starting by adding a million new people to union ranks over the next 10 years. 
As she spoke at a Monitor Breakfast for reporters..."
"Labor unions are more popular than ever. A recent Gallup poll found support for unions at 71%, the highest it has been since Gallup started asking the question in 1965. 
They are enjoying a comeback thanks to highly visible organizing campaigns at Starbucks and Amazon, a tight labor market and concerns around COVID-19 in the workplace. But can their popularity last?
With so few workers belonging to unions anymore, it may be that today’s workforce likes the idea of unions, even if they don’t fully understand the good and bad consequences of..."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump faced one of the gravest threats of his political career as the coronavirus pandemic spread, leaving fellow Republicans to worry that the White House’s response and the hit to the economy would harm his re-election prospects.
U.S. stock market indexes that Trump has touted throughout his term as evidence of his success plunged into bear market territory on Thursday - a day after he tried to calm Americans’ fears with an Oval Office address that promised economic stimulus and a 30-day travel ban for..."
"President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, according to people familiar with the decision, selecting a legal advocate who has waged battles to preserve the Affordable Care Act.
Mr. Becerra led a coalition of 20 states and Washington, D.C., in a legal defense of the ACA after Republican-led states brought a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the Obama-era health law. The U.S. Supreme Court last month heard arguments in the case. The Trump administration has asked the court..."
"President Trump said Wednesday that he has instructed the U.S. Navy to “shoot down and destroy” Iranian vessels that harass American ships at sea.
“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump tweeted.
The president did not reference any specific incident, but his tweet follows a tense encounter between Iranian and U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf last week. The U.S. military said that 11 Iranian ships repeatedly made “dangerous and harassing..."
"To call the past few years a time of upheaval is a pretty huge understatement. Gender roles and gender identity, race and justice, capitalism and socialism, hyperpolarization, wars, and pandemics – all have brought disruption at levels unseen in generations. Now we’re witnessing what economists are calling the Great Resignation, the unprecedented decision by many Americans to voluntarily quit their jobs, step back, and ask what they really want from work and life. 
In some ways, this time of year is about doing just that. Yes, there are turkeys and..."
"Miles Taylor reveals he is the “Anonymous” Trump Administration insider and now faces harsh backlash from President Trump and others on all sides.
Miles Taylor, former Department of Homeland Security official for the Trump Administration, revealed today that he’s the individual who anonymously authored the scathing opinion piece in The New York Times about what he describes as President Trump’s failed leadership and perilous presidency. Taylor later followed up that September 2018 NYT op-ed with a book about the Trump White House titled A Warning. Both the op-ed and the..."
"U.S.-led NATO said on Tuesday its member states were boosting security around key installations as Russia escalated its attacks on Ukraine and stepped up threats against the West.
Russian missiles pounded Ukraine for a second day, after dozens of air raids across the country on Monday that killed 19 people, wounded more than 100 and knocked out power supplies.
Moscow has annexed new tracts of Ukraine, mobilised hundreds of thousands of Russians to fight and repeatedly threatened to use nuclear arms in recent weeks, spreading alarm in the West. A..."
"Poland has said the missile that hit a grain facility on Tuesday, killing two people near the border with Ukraine, was probably an ""old"" S-300 rocket, a Soviet-era missile system being used by both Russia and Ukraine.
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said it was likely being used as a Ukrainian air defence missile, but that Russia carried ultimate responsibility for the incident for having invaded Ukraine, triggering a now almost nine-month-old war. Russia at the time was firing scores of missiles at cities across Ukraine.
WHAT IS THE S-300?
The S-300..."
"Flooding from monsoon rain on an unimaginable scale has ravaged Pakistan, leaving more than 1,100 people dead and destroying villages, crops and livestock in a country dependent on agriculture.
The rains, combined with melting glaciers, have unleashed a devastating amount of water.
CNN posted satellite images of a new lake that’s formed — turning part of Sindh Province into an inland lake that’s 62 miles across. More than 3,500 people have been injured.
“One-third of Pakistan is inundated, as floods sweep through the country this summer. The catastrophic floods, resulting..."
"As a third of the Islamic Republic of 220 million people lay underwater as a result of the worst floods in the nation's history, Pakistan's envoy to the United Nations revealed to Newsweek a plan to combat the worsening effects of global climate change and prevent future calamities from befalling other nations.

"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests so the Chinese-ruled city can move forward from a “highly vulnerable and dangerous” place and find solutions.
Her televised announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealing that Beijing had thwarted an earlier proposal from Lam to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters.
“Lingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our..."
"The future of Obamacare could be at stake on Tuesday when a coalition of Democratic-led states and House of Representatives urge a federal appeals court to overturn a Texas judge’s ruling that the U.S. healthcare reform law is unconstitutional.
Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), since its 2010 passage, and while the Justice Department would normally defend a federal law, the Trump administration has declined to defend its constitutionality against a challenge by 18 Republican-led states.
A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general..."
"A nation that had begun to celebrate victory in the exhausting fight against the coronavirus is starting to realize the end is not in sight after all.
As the light at the end of the tunnel recedes, the big political question is who will be punished by a frustrated public. 
Daily new COVID-19 cases have risen by more than 50 percent in the last week alone. Major cities including New York and Washington have tightened restrictions.
Meanwhile, the start of the new school year is looming — a pivotal moment..."
"Seven Capitol Police officers filed a lawsuit against former President Trump, several of his associates and extremist group leaders on Thursday, alleging they organized a plot to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power that culminated into the violent Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Why it matters: The suit argues that Trump and the other defendants violated the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, which in part prohibited conspiracies to overthrow the federal government.
The law prevents authorities from depriving a person of their constitutional rights, and the lawsuit alleges that Trump and his co-defendants violated..."
"The city of Minneapolis has settled a civil suit with the family of George Floyd for a record $27 million.
The settlement was unanimously approved by the Minneapolis City Council on Friday. It’s the largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in American history.
""When George Floyd was horrifically killed on May 25, 2020, it was a watershed moment for America,"" Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing the Floyd family, said at a press conference with city Mayor Jacob Frey (D) and members of Floyd's family..."
"The United States on Thursday surpassed China and Italy as the country with the most coronavirus cases, according to a Reuters tally, as New York, New Orleans and other hot spots faced a surge in hospitalizations and looming shortages in supplies, staff and sick beds.
Medical facilities were running low on ventilators and protective masks and were hampered by limited diagnostic testing capacity.
The number of U.S. cases of coronavirus reached 81,378, the Reuters tally showed. China was second with 81,285 cases, and Italy third with 80,539 cases.

"The leaders of the Senate were happy Thursday with their deal to avoid a debt default. They were about the only ones.
Why it matters: The Band-Aid does nothing to solve the debt ceiling problem long term for Americans. Democrats fear it only kicks the can down the road to a very busy December. Republicans, meanwhile, are mad their party blinked.
“Why the hell would I make it easier for them to raise the debt ceiling through regular order? We had a strategy and we abandoned it,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN's Manu..."
"Election officials in the largest county in Nevada said Wednesday that ballot counting will continue through next week, though the majority of 2022 ballots could be counted by Friday, as the nation anxiously awaits election results for the state’s Senate seat.
Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria said in a news conference that Tuesday, Nov. 15, is the deadline to verify mail-in ballots and Thursday, Nov. 17, is the latest date for releasing the final, unofficial election results.

"This week it’s a New Moon.
The moment when the Moon is between Earth and the Sun sees the far side of the Moon illuminated. During this time—marked at precisely 3:27 a.m. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on Thursday, April 23, 2020—no-one on Earth can see anything of the Moon.
However, a few hours after New Moon, when our satellite has moved away from that point in space between the Earth and Sun, its limb is suddenly lit-up, as seen from Earth.
The result is a super-slim crescent Moon...."
"President Biden’s comments Wednesday regarding Russia’s intentions toward Ukraine are unlikely to reassure the government in Kyiv that the United States “has its back.” In a White House news conference, the president was unambiguous regarding a likely American and NATO response to a full-blown Russian invasion, but he indicated that the level of Russia’s aggression might determine the response. 
Russia no longer could do any business in dollars if it invades its neighbor, Biden said; it would be excluded from the SWIFT system for international funds transfer. He would subject Moscow to severe sanctions,..."
"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has agreed to a five-day ceasefire in northeast Syria to allow for withdrawal of Kurdish forces, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday after talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
“Today the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria,” Pence told a news conference after more than four hours of talks at the presidential palace in Ankara.
Pence had flown to Turkey to call for a halt in Turkey’s cross-border military operation, called Operation Peace Spring, under which Turkey has aimed..."
"Analysts expect U.S. gasoline prices to rise in 2020, saying they could reach around $4 per gallon in late spring, presenting a major political problem for President Biden.
Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told The Hill that there’s a “good chance” prices will be “close"" to 2008 highs, when prices were above $4 per gallon.
“Notwithstanding another variant…we’re going to see excessively high prices in 2022,” said Kloza. “It’s going to run up, I’d say, between Presidents’ Day and Cinco de Mayo.”
He attributed the potential increase to..."
"As news that Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz was about to publish a piece revealing the identity of the creator of Twitter account Libs of Tik Tok started spreading, outraged conservatives accused the journalist of ""doxxing"" and harassing the anonymous account holder.
The conservative account Libs of Tik Tok, which mostly shares content attacking liberals as well as school teachers accused of the alleged ""grooming"" and ""indoctrination"" of children on LGBT rights, has become a social media sensation in the past two years, achieving a follower base of some 648,000 on Twitter, over 66,000..."
"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Thursday introduced long-shot bills to lower the salary of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, to $0 and bar businesses from refusing service to people who are unvaccinated, the latest stunt Greene has pulled since she was stripped of her committee assignments in February. In a press release, Greene slammed Fauci, who has polled as one of the most trusted voices on the pandemic, as “Dr. Always Wrong” and took aim at him for being the highest paid federal official with..."
"The Phase One trade deal between the United States and China is expected to be signed today, January 15. Details have not yet emerged, but certain pledges have been announced by both sides since a preliminary agreement was reached on December 13. Among them, the United States will begin to dial back tariffs and withdraw its “currency manipulator” designation – a major source of tension – in exchange for PRC guarantees to purchase a $200 billion bundle in US goods and services over the next two years. Included in this..."
"School districts across Ohio will be able to authorize teachers, principals and other staff to carry firearms into classrooms this fall after 24 hours of training. 
The new law, signed Monday by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, will lower the required training hours for armed school personnel from about 700 hours to four scenario-based training hours, plus a maximum of 20 hours for first-aid training, history of school shootings and reunification education. 
The signing came the same day Ohio's new constitutional carry law took effect.

"Former White House counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to testify Friday behind closed doors before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, according to multiple news reports.
A person familiar with the discussions told The New York Times Cipollone would be participating in a transcribed interview."
"The Biden administration on Wednesday pushed back on what it called ""misinformation,"" saying a federal grant program meant to reduce harm to drug users does not include taxpayer funding for pipes that can be used to smoke crack or meth.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) put out a statement clarifying ""no federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits.""
White House press secretary Jen Psaki later told reporters at a briefing that reports that crack pipes would be included in the safe..."
"On any given day, any one of the attacks that I mention in this column would be newsworthy. The fact that this is only a sampling of the many attacks on journalists this weekend underscores the dangers that they are willing to face to document an outpouring of anger, frustration and, in some cases, senseless opportunistic violence.
A crowd swarmed WLKY chief photographer Paul Ahmann, knocked him to the ground, then surrounded him while laughing and taking pictures of him.
Demonstrators trashed news cars in Boston, Atlanta, Louisville and Los..."
"Filings for jobless benefits fell last week to their lowest level since March, a sign layoffs eased somewhat as the labor market tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
Initial unemployment claims fell by a seasonally adjusted 249,000 to 1.2 million for the week ended Aug. 1, the Labor Department said Thursday. The decline came as an extra $600 a week in pandemic-related unemployment benefits ended.
The number of applications last week was the lowest since the pandemic struck the U.S. Weekly claims figures, however, remain well above the pre-pandemic..."
"Federal authorities sought warrants to investigate Michael Cohen’s email accounts in July 2017, nine months before the office and hotel room of U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer were raided, according to documents made public on Tuesday.
Emails were sought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, which is probing Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as the FBI, according to the documents.
The documents, totaling several hundred pages, were released after U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan on Monday ordered federal prosecutors to make..."
"Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas.
People from those countries will still be able to visit the US as tourists.
In 2018 the US issued twice as many immigration visas to Nigeria than to the other five nations combined.
An official said the new measures were the result of failures by the six countries to meet US security and information-sharing standards."
"A day-old cease-fire deal between the U.S. and Turkey that led to a brief lull in the Turkish offensive in northeastern Syria appeared shaky Friday. Fighting flared in the border region with each side blaming the other for the resumption in violence.
On Thursday, the U.S. and Turkey agreed that Ankara would suspend military operations so Kurdish fighters could lay down arms and leave the area. But sporadic clashes, drone strikes and artillery shelling resumed overnight and increased into Friday morning around the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ain, according..."
"The coronavirus has now killed 200,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins data.
The big picture: Whatever context you try to put this in, it is a catastrophe of historic proportions — and is yet another reminder of America's horrific failure to contain the virus.
The coronavirus has killed a bigger share of the American population than it has in almost any other wealthy country.
The death toll here is equivalent to roughly 65 Sept. 11 attacks. Three times more Americans have died from COVID than died in the Vietnam..."
"Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has left the Democratic Party, branding its leadership ""an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness.""
Gabbard, who unsuccessfully stood for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in the 2020 election, made the announcement with a video posted on Twitter, in which she accused the Democrats of stoking ""anti-white racism,"" and ""dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.""
She also announced the launch of The Tulsi Gabbard Show, with the first 28-minute episode titled ""Why I'm leaving the Democratic Party"" uploaded to YouTube.
  Explaining her decision to leave Gabbard said: ""I can..."
"Federal agents searched former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate after developing evidence that government records were “likely concealed and removed” in defiance of a grand jury subpoena, according to Department of Justice (DOJ) court documents filed late Tuesday evening.
The filing details the chronology of federal officials’ monthslong attempt to recover presidential records and classified documents from Trump’s Florida home, casting doubt on the former president’s team’s claims that a “diligent search” was conducted and all documents requested by the subpoena were returned.
Trump has claimed the search warrant of Mar-a-Lago was unnecessary since..."
"President Trump tweeted early Friday that he and the first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for Covid-19. It couldn’t be determined whether the president or the first lady were displaying any symptoms. Here’s what we know.
How did President Trump and first lady Melania get infected with the new coronavirus?
The president announced the coronavirus test results in the early hours of Friday, a development that injects fresh uncertainty into an already tumultuous final stretch of the 2020 campaign. The news came hours after Mr. Trump confirmed that Hope..."
"Jack Welch led General Electric Co. through two decades of unparalleled growth and transformation, with a brash style that single-handedly remade the conglomerate and changed the landscape of America corporations. He died Sunday at age 84.
Mr. Welch’s success, driven by a hard-nosed strategy to slash less profitable businesses and unproductive employees, made him an international celebrity in the 1980s and drove GE to become the most valuable U.S. company during the 1990s. He groomed a generation of business leaders who went on to run giants such as Boeing Co...."
"With gasoline prices at a 14-year high, it’s hard to imagine paying even more at the pump. Yet prices are only heading higher.
On Sunday, the national average for a gallon of gas hit $4.009, the highest since July 2008, according to data from AAA. 
An increase in demand along with a reduction in supply is quickly driving up prices at gas stations, the automotive group said.
With the recent rise, consumers are now paying 40 cents more than just a week ago.
“There are few words to describe the unprecedented..."
"The U.S. labor market sprang back to life in October after a summer slowdown, with employers briskly adding jobs and nearly 200,000 women joining the labor force.
The economy churned out 531,000 new jobs last month, the biggest gain in three months, the Labor Department said Friday. Restaurants, consulting firms and factories all boosted hiring, suggesting broad strength across the economy. Nationwide job growth was also stronger in August and September than previously estimated, with new data boosting employment over that period by 235,000 jobs.

"A jury convicted two men Tuesday for plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) in 2020, part of what prosecutors have described as a larger domestic terrorist plan to set off a civil war and attempt to overthrow the government.
Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of all charges brought against them in federal court in Michigan, including conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to obtain weapons of mass destruction, and Croft was convicted of an additional explosives charge, according to the Associated Press and other outlets.

"Elon Musk has found something to keep himself occupied until his first crewed mission to Mars fulfills his prediction and lands on the Red Planet in 2029. He’s purchased a 9.2 percent share in Twitter for $2.9 billion — where he has 80.2 million followers — making him the social media company’s largest shareholder. Given his $299 billion fortune, all it would take is a few mouse clicks to place the entire company in his shopping cart and complete the transaction in short order. If he does so, in addition to being the electric car..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a New York handgun-licensing law that required New Yorkers who want to carry a handgun in public to show a special need to defend themselves.
The 6-3 ruling, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, is the court’s first significant decision on gun rights in over a decade. In a far-reaching ruling, the court made clear that the Second Amendment’s guarantee of the right “to keep and bear arms” protects a broad right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense. Going forward, Thomas explained,..."
"Moderna’s 94.5 percent vaccine efficacy rate brings renewed hope that a preventative therapy to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may be close at hand. This news is especially welcome as cases continue to spike across the country. But unless the American people trust it (or any of the other vaccines currently under development for that matter), nothing will change.
Only half of the American adults would receive a coronavirus vaccine if it were available today. That number is down precipitously from over 70 percent in May. Even more startling, a..."
"In a closed meeting with White House officials, senators said they were considering moves to block the tariffs.
The president has said he plans to impose a 5% duty on all Mexican goods from next week.
Mr Trump, who is on a state visit to the UK, said Republicans would be ""foolish"" to try and stop him.
Under the president's proposals, the tariffs would rise by 5% every month, reaching 25% in October if Mexico did not act to halt migrants coming across the southern border.
""There is not much..."
"A federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration on Monday in declining to block a rule that restricts what federally funded family planning providers can tell patients about abortion.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the plaintiffs in the case, including several states, Planned Parenthood and Essential Access Health, would not succeed because the rule is a ""reasonable interpretation"" of the law.
With four judges dissenting, the court let stand its earlier decision to overturn injunctions on the rule issued by lower courts...."
"Presently, a majority of American’s have made the leap on climate change. A 2020 Pew Research Center poll found two thirds believed governments should do more to address climate change. Climate change ranks as one of the nation’s leading worries, especially for younger voters.
Voters want the government to act. This is why President Biden’s $2 trillion green infrastructure proposal was relatively uncontroversial. A U.S. president is finally responding to voter alarm with action. And none too soon. But even still, America appears split with a large minority, fueled by misinformation, resisting action. In such a divided..."
"For the last two-plus years, I have been fortunate to interview industry dignitaries, thinkers, entrepreneurs, and leaders for Forbes Insights in the podcast Futures in Focus about the forthcoming world of 2030. 95% of the interviews have been incredibly optimistic, with a cause. 2020 has been an acid test of their ideas, visions, and practices.
2020 could be seen as a catalyst for ideas like EV dominance by 2030. Just look at the market capitalization of Tesla. 2020 has violently accelerated the shift to digital retail. Again, look at the..."
"The price of gasoline in the U.S. has fallen for 24 consecutive days after hitting a record last month. But analysts said prices might rise again if demand from drivers increases and supplies are constrained.
The average cost of a gallon of unleaded gas was $4.72 on Friday. That is down about 6% since prices hit their highest point, $5.02, on June 14, according to data from OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider. "
"Trump: ""Just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.""
Verdict: We can find no evidence to support this claim.
The president may have been referring to a study by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that found adults with Covid-19 were more than twice as likely to have reported eating at a restaurant before getting ill, compared to those without the disease.
The study found that 85% of the 150 respondents with coronavirus said they had..."
"Russia said on Thursday that it was difficult to exchange prisoners with the United States and suggested Washington be silent about the fate of Brittney Griner, the U.S. basketball star detained in Russia on drugs charges.
Referring to a letter that U.S. President Joe Biden intends to send to Griner according to NBC news, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that ""hype"" around the case does not help, and that ""this kind of correspondence does not help"".
The United States and Russia swapped prisoners in late April when Moscow released..."
"Fox News anchor Bret Baier confirmed he has ""concerns"" about a documentary produced by the network's leading prime-time host, Tucker Carlson, that focuses on the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“I didn’t get hurt by it. I didn’t get damaged by it. Were you bothered by it? Because that’s the reporting,"" Brian Kilmeade, who is a co-host of the ""Fox & Friends"" morning program, asked Baier on Monday afternoon during an appearance on Kilmeade's radio show.

"President Biden said he raised some of the biggest issues dividing the U.S. and Russia during a summit with President Vladimir Putin, including Moscow’s aggression toward Ukraine, alleged cyberattacks against the U.S. and jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.
“The bottom line is I told President Putin that we need to have some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by,” Mr. Biden said at a news conference Wednesday following the summit.
Mr. Biden said he called on Mr. Putin to respect human rights and raised the case..."
"Andrew Gillum, Tallahassee's telegenic former mayor and the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor, was involved in a meth overdose incident early Friday morning in a Miami Beach hotel room.
The incident was an embarrassing and devastating blow to Gillum, a long-serving former city commissioner and mayor who caught fire as a statewide candidate two years ago and still harbored ambitions of becoming governor or holding other high office."
"President Trump broke with precedent on the second night of the Republican National Convention, granting a pardon and participating in a naturalization ceremony at the White House in videos that aired Tuesday during the prime-time event.
Speeches from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and first lady Melania Trump also pushed the boundaries of rules surrounding the mix of politics and governance.
Several portions of the convention used the White House as a backdrop for Trump to put his presidential powers on full display in an election year that has him..."
"Defenders of the besieged city of Mariupol will fight to the end against Russian forces, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says.
The port city has not fallen despite an ultimatum from Moscow to remaining fighters to give up, he said.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia has chosen to raze Mariupol to the ground.
Local officials said Russian forces have announced they will stop anyone from entering or leaving the city.
Capturing the whole of the city is seen as a major strategic prize for Russia, leaving it in..."
"As Democrats inch closer to finalizing their social spending package, Senate Democrats are eyeing a tax on billionaires amid pushback on income and corporate levy hikes.
The proposal, called the Billionaires Income Tax, may affect roughly 700 Americans with more than $1 billion of wealth or earning over $100 million annually for three consecutive years.
Billionaires may face an annual levy on the increased value of assets, such as stocks and bonds, regardless of when they sell, known as “mark-to-market.” However, investors may still write off losses every year.

"The Senate confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Monday, providing President Trump with a last-minute political victory just days before November 3.
The 52-48 Senate vote on Barrett's nomination capped off a rare presidential election year Supreme Court fight sparked by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 18. GOP Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was the only Republican to oppose Barrett, saying she doesn’t believe a nomination should come up before the election.

"President Biden on Monday announced Steve Dettelbach as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as new plans to regulate so-called ""ghost guns.""

"Amid threats for more than a decade that Israel would destroy Hamas and rebuild Israel’s deterrence, in reality, the policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his governments have been to keep a weakened Hamas in power. The primary reason for this policy is to ensure that in the eyes of the Israeli public there is no Palestinian partner for peace.

"Ukraine on Thursday accused Russia of having invaded the country, dashing hopes of progress toward a diplomatic resolution and challenging the West to respond.

But he stopped short of calling it an invasion, saying it represented an ""incursion"" apparently aimed at preventing Kiev's forces from defeating the pro-Russia rebels, rather than a broader assault."
"The Justice Department on Thursday moved to unseal a warrant authorizing a search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate this week following escalating demands for answers about the unprecedented investigation.

"The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday voted to condemn the online pro-Trump conspiracy theory known as “QAnon,” but 17 Republicans opposed the non-binding resolution, whose sponsor Democrat Representative Tom Malinowski said he has received death threats.
The House voted 371-18 to reject the conspiracy theory, which posits President Donald Trump has been working to take down a global child sex ring. As many as a dozen Republican candidates for Congress have voiced some support for the theory, and at least one of them appears to be a on a..."
