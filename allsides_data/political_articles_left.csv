"As Yasmin Miller drove home from a laundromat in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood last weekend, a gunman in another car peppered her red Hyundai sedan with bullets, grazing her head and striking her son, Sincere Gaston, in the chest. Sincere died in his car seat. He was 20 months old.
On June 20, a man fired gunshots through the back of a dark blue SUV, wounding the 27-year-old man driving and hitting his stepson, Mekhi James, in the back, killing him. Mekhi was three.

"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday told Congress that the U.S. will run out of flexibility to avoid breaching the debt limit on Oct. 18, setting a new deadline for lawmakers to avoid a catastrophic default on its payment obligations.
“It is uncertain whether we could continue to meet all the nation’s commitments after that date,” Yellen wrote in the letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
Yellen’s letter came less than 24 hours after Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would suspend the debt ceiling and prevent a government shutdown on Friday. Senate..."
"It was surely different from 2012.
Back then, Chris Christie was a potential candidate introducing himself on the national stage as his party nominated Mitt Romney.
The Republican convention was the first time many conservatives and Americans around the country learned the facts of what would become the New Jersey governor’s stump speech: that he is the son of an Irish father and a Sicilian mother, that his mother ruled with an iron fist and his dad was, “in the automobile of life,” merely “a passenger.” He was..."
"Senior Biden administration officials announced Wednesday that they are reminding tens of thousands of pharmacies around the country that they risk violating civil rights laws if they refuse to fill orders for contraception or abortion medication or discriminate based on a person’s pregnancy status.
The action comes a few weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave more than a dozen states a green light to ban abortion, and aims to respond to a wave of reports that pharmacies in those states are refusing to not only fill prescriptions for abortion..."
"Vice President Mike Pence voiced support Monday for the Trump administration's move to prohibit U.S. embassies from flying the rainbow pride flag on their flagpoles during LGBTQ Pride Month, telling NBC News that ""it's the right decision.""
In an interview with White House correspondent Kristen Welker, Pence confirmed an exclusive report from NBC News that said the State Department had rejected requests from at least four U.S. embassies to fly the flag during June. Pence said he was aware the State Department had said the American flag was the only..."
"In a Monday evening television interview, Vice President Mike Pence confirmed reports that American embassies had been banned from flying the pride flag on their embassy flagpoles.
In an interview with NBC News, Pence said, “I’m aware that the State Department indicated that on the flagpole of our American embassies that one flag should fly, and that’s the American flag, and I support that.""
The Trump administration came under fire at the beginning of June for allegedly banning U.S. embassies from flying the pride flag. American diplomats told NBC..."
"President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a number of new steps his administration will take to try to get more Americans vaccinated and slow the spread of coronavirus, including requiring that all federal employees must attest to being vaccinated against Covid-19 or face strict protocols.
The new measures come amid a rise in Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the US. The vast majority of those individuals with severe cases of Covid-19 are unvaccinated.
""This is an American tragedy. People are dying -- and will die -- who don't have to die. If you're out..."
"With classes scheduled to start next week, incoming Harvard freshman Ismail B. Ajjawi, like many of his fellow students, was set to arrive on campus for the first time this week. But the 17-year-old Palestinian’s hard-won education at perhaps the world’s preeminent university is now in doubt. American immigration officials stopped Ajjawi, a Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, at Boston Logan International Airport on Friday night, the Crimson reports, where he was held in custody for eight hours and subjected to invasive questioning by a female immigration officer, who then..."
"Protesters staged large-scale demonstrations across the country on Sunday, expressing outrage at the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and, more broadly, anger at police brutality. Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Seattle, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting.
By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds.
Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died..."
"Pockets of the United States descended into chaos Sunday as another day of mass demonstrations over the death of yet another black man in police custody led to another night of fire and fury.
Protests that began peacefully exploded into mayhem as windows were smashed, stores were looted, buildings were vandalized and police vehicles were torched. The unrest spread from Chicago, Atlanta and Boston to Sacramento, Seattle and Sioux Falls, S.D. As protesters and police clashed outside the White House for a third consecutive night, President Trump tweeted a call..."
"President Donald Trump has been raising questions by his dogged endorsement of an unproven treatment for the coronavirus — and his motivations appear to be more financial than medical.
Trump admits he’s not a doctor — which, of course, he’s not — but MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and the Washington Post‘s Eugene Robinson are among many wondering whether the president is trying to boost the market for the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine.
“As ‘Deep Throat’ never actually said, follow the money,” Robinson said, quoting the apocryphal advice from the undercover source who..."
"North Korea is proposing a joint investigation with the U.S. to look into the massive cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment.
On Saturday, a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry in Pyongyang promised ""grave consequences"" if the U.S. does not agree to a joint investigation.
""The U.S. should bear in mind that it will face serious consequences in case it rejects our proposal for joint investigation and presses for what it called countermeasures while finding fault"" with North Korea, the spo"
"President Obama said on Friday that the United States “will respond proportionally” against North Korea for its destructive cyberattacks on Sony Pictures, but he criticized the Hollywood studio for giving in to intimidation when it withdrew “The Interview,” the satirical movie that provoked the attacks, before it opened.
Deliberately avoiding specific discussion of what kind of steps he was planning against the reclusive nuclear-armed state, Mr. Obama said that the response would come “in a place and time and manner that we choose.” Speaking at a White House news conference..."
"Members of the National Guard have been allowed back into the Capitol Complex after a slate of lawmakers voiced their outrage at guardsmen being banished to a parking garage as a rest area, a guardsman told CNN.
The Guard will now be allowed to rest in the US Capitol Visitor Center, the guardsman said.
The change comes after thousands of National Guardsmen were moved to a parking garage after they were told they could no longer use space within the US Capitol Complex, including areas like the cafeteria of a..."
"President Joe Biden is tasking Vice President Kamala Harris with overseeing efforts with Central American countries to stem the flow of migrants to the US southern border, the first major issue Biden has assigned directly to his No. 2.
""I asked her, the VP, today, because she's the most qualified person to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the countries that can help, need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,"" Biden told reporters..."
"US inflation roared again to a fresh four-decade high last month, likely strengthening the Federal Reserve’s resolve to aggressively raise interest rates that risks upending the economic expansion.
The consumer price index rose 9.1% from a year earlier in a broad-based advance, the largest gain since the end of 1981, Labor Department data showed Wednesday. The widely followed inflation gauge increased 1.3% from a month earlier, the most since 2005, reflecting higher gasoline, shelter and food costs.
Economists projected a 1.1% rise from May and an 8.8% year-over-year increase, based..."
"The outlook for the economy became sunnier on Friday after the Labor Department reported that employers added 295,000 workers in February, far exceeding expectations, and also recorded a drop in the unemployment rate. The data, though, offered disappointing results for wage growth, which for months has barely budged."
"United States Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday that Washington is counting on Asian partners to help rein in an increasingly aggressive China, as two of the US Navy's most powerful warships conducted drills with allies in the Indian and Pacific oceans.
Esper accused Beijing of bullying nations around the Pacific, depriving countries with claims in the South China Sea of fishing rights and trillions of dollars of oil and gas revenue. He also accused China of ""brazen disregard of international commitments.""

"Firefighters continued to battle blazes in southern Europe as searing temperatures moved north and Britain braced for what could be its hottest day on record.
Expectations are now high that on Tuesday the British record of 38.7C could be broken and 40C breached for the first time, with experts blaming climate change and predicting more frequent extreme weather to come.
Temperatures are also forecast to rise above 35C in the Netherlands while neighbouring Belgium is expected to hit 40C and over.
In France, a host of towns and cities recorded their highest-ever temperatures..."
"“I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done.”
— President Trump, news conference, Feb. 16, 2017
We can’t quite fact check the statement above — it’s certainly open to debate what counts as achievements — but we can fact-check 15 dubious claims made by the president in his lengthy news conference. Some of these are from his greatest hits of falsehoods, which we have fact-checked many times before. The claims are addressed in the order in..."
"Attorney General Bill Barr blasted his own Justice Department prosecutors as a ""permanent bureaucracy"" that all too often abuse their power to go after high-profile targets in a process he likened to ""headhunting.""
In remarks Wednesday to a largely conservative audience celebrating Constitution Day at Hillsdale College, the leader of the Justice Department asserted that he's the one who should make the big calls in cases of national interest.
""The notion that line prosecutors should make the final decisions at the Department of Justice is completely crazy,"" Barr said.
""Under..."
"Attorney General William Barr suggested on Wednesday that the calls for a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus were the ""greatest intrusion on civil liberties"" in history ""other than slavery.""
The comments came minutes after he slammed the hundreds of Justice Department prosecutors working beneath him, equating them to preschoolers, in a defense of his own politically tuned decision making in the Trump administration.
Addressing a Constitution Day celebration hosted by Hillsdale College, the event's host asked Barr to explain the ""constitutional hurdles for forbidding a church..."
"Ukrainian officials defiantly rejected a Russian demand that their forces in Mariupol lay down arms and raise white flags Monday in exchange for safe passage out of the besieged strategic port city.
Even as Russia intensified its attempt to pummel Mariupol into surrender, its offensive in other parts of Ukraine has floundered. Western governments and analysts say the broader conflict is grinding into a war of attrition, with Russia continuing to bombard cities.
In the capital, Kyiv, a shopping center in the densely populated Podil district near the city center was..."
"The fate of Ukrainian port city Mariupol remained uncertain Monday, after it rejected Moscow’s ultimatum to surrender after weeks of Russian bombardments and days of street-by-street guerrilla warfare. Russia is bent on seizing Mariupol — which would be its first strategic victory in a war that appears to be approaching a stalemate in many other parts of the country — and has threatened the city with more assaults and a “military tribunal.""
Even so, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Monday that “Kyiv remains Russia’s primary military objective” and that Moscow is likely to try to..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday delivered a scathing rebuke of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s actions and defended Rep. Liz Cheney’s decision to vote to impeach former president Donald Trump, weighing in for the first time on the criticism facing both lawmakers.
The statements together are both an unusual venture from a Senate leader onto the other chamber’s turf and an unmistakable signal to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that, for the party’s sake, he must sideline extremists such as Greene (R-Ga.) and maintain a place for..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday went to bat for GOP Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney while condemning remarks from freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
McConnell issued a statement condemning the extremist views of Greene, whose support for QAnon and other conspiracy theories has drawn scorn from Democrats and some Republicans.
McConnell said the Georgia congresswoman's embrace of conspiracy theories and ""loony lies"" is a ""cancer for the Republican Party.""
""Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and..."
"It wasn't exactly a surprise to hear that President Obama named U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice as his next national security adviser.
Almost as soon as it became clear that her role in the administration's Benghazi talking-points snafu meant Senate Republicans would never let her be confirmed as secretary of state if Obama nominated her, the possibility of her taking over from Tom Donilon as Obama's top national security aide was fre"
"President Obama announced a major shuffle of his national security team on Wednesday, ushering out a cautious Washington insider and elevating two long-time proponents of a larger American role in preventing humanitarian crises and protecting human rights.
The ideological shift signaled by the choices highlights a central dilemma for Obama as he seeks to make a mark on the world at a time of austerity Ã¢â‚¬â€ and war weariness Ã¢â‚¬â€ at home. How ambitious Obama intends to be abroad at a tim"
"In early July the Department of Homeland Security withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies of a Russian scheme to promote “allegations about the poor mental health” of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to internal emails and a draft of the document obtained by ABC News.
The draft bulletin, titled “Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,” was submitted to the agency’s legislative and public affairs office for review on July 7. The analysis was not meant for public consumption, but..."
"Internal White House records from the day of the attack on the U.S. Capitol that were turned over to the House select committee show a gap in President Donald Trump's phone logs of seven hours and 37 minutes, including the period when the building was being violently assaulted, according to documents obtained by CBS News' chief election & campaign correspondent Robert Costa and The Washington Post's associate editor Bob Woodward.
The lack of an official White House notation of any calls placed to or by Trump for 457 minutes —..."
"The ninth GOP debate featured the top six remaining candidates for the party’s presidential nomination. They repeated several false and misleading claims, and made some new ones, too.
• Sen. Ted Cruz claimed that “we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.” That’s wrong. Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in 1988, an election year."
"One might have expected the ninth Republican presidential debate to be a cut above the earlier edition. With Chris Christie out of the race and Ben Carson present but basically out of the running, it was a chance for the race to get serious, for the five candidates who could potentially win this thing to make their cases without much distraction from the B players."
"The leaders of Congress’s tax-writing committees reached agreement Thursday on legislation to give President Obama “fast track” authority to negotiate an ambitious trade accord with 11 other Pacific nations, beginning what is sure to be one of the toughest legislative battles of his last 19 months in office.
The “trade promotion authority” bill — likely to be unveiled Thursday afternoon — would give Congress the power to vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership once it is completed, but would deny lawmakers the chance to amend what would be the largest trade..."
"Search and rescue teams backed by the National Guard searched Friday for people missing in record floods that wiped out entire communities in some of the poorest places in America. Kentucky’s governor said 15 people have died, a toll he expected to grow as the rain keeps falling.
“We’ve still got a lot of searching to do,” said Jerry Stacy, the emergency management director in Kentucky ’s hard-hit Perry County. “We still have missing people.”
Powerful floodwaters swallowed towns that hug creeks and streams in Appalachian valleys and hollows, swamping homes and businesses, leaving..."
"At least 15 people are dead following catastrophic flooding in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN Friday. That number is expected to double, he said, and will include children.
""There's going to be multiple families that we've lost,"" Beshear told Brianna Keilar on CNN's ""New Day."" ""Kids that won't get the opportunity to grow up and experience so much that we have.""
""This is so deadly, and it hit so hard, and it hit in the middle of the night,"" the governor said, adding that although eastern Kentucky often floods, ""we've never..."
"President Trump railed against a Democratic memo countering Republican claims of FBI wrongdoing late Saturday, even as he dismissed its significance. Speaking to Fox News, the president said the memo—released in redacted form Saturday after Trump had earlier objected to its release—“was a nothing.” But he couldn’t seem to stop tweeting or talking about it. Authored by House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff, the document lays out a range of information the FBI and Justice Department used to justify wiretapping former Trump adviser Carter Page, undermining allegations in a Republican..."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday approved the antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization.
Given through an IV, remdesivir works to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the drug's manufacturer, California-based Gilead Sciences, Inc. Previously authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19, the drug is now the first and only approved COVID-19 treatment in the United States, Gilead said in a release.

"President Joe Biden’s warning that the world is at risk of a nuclear “Armageddon” was designed to send an unvarnished message that no one should underestimate the extraordinary danger if Russia deploys tactical nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, administration officials said Friday.
The president’s grim assessment, delivered during a Democratic fundraiser on Thursday night, rippled around the globe and appeared to edge beyond the boundaries of current U.S. intelligence assessments. U.S. security officials continue to say they have no evidence that Vladimir Putin has imminent plans for a..."
"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's personal assistant, who's been with him since the start of his administration, has abruptly left the White House after sharing intimate details about the President's family with reporters, multiple people tell CNN.
Madeleine Westerhout was forced to resign as executive assistant to the President on Thursday after Trump learned she had shared information with reporters at a recent off-the-record meeting, during which she didn't say her comments were off the record, according to sources familiar with her departure. A reporter divulged details about the dinner to..."
"Facts don’t care about your feelings, but Florida Republicans do—if you’re a white person, that is. 
A new bill pushed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allies in the Florida legislature, titled simply “Individual Freedom,” would—among other things—“prohibit classroom instruction and curricula from being used to indoctrinate or persuade students,” and target conversations about racism in the school and workplace.
The bill was introduced by Miami-area Sen. Manny Diaz and passed the Senate Education Committee on a party-line vote Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. 
“An individual, by virtue of his or..."
"A bill pushed by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that would prohibit public schools and private businesses from making white people feel “discomfort” when they teach students or train employees about discrimination in the nation’s past received its first approval Tuesday.
The Senate Education Committee approved the bill that takes aim at critical race theory — though it doesn’t mention it explicitly — on party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.
Democrats argued the bill isn’t needed, would lead to frivolous lawsuits and said it would amount to..."
"President Joe Biden plans to lift his predecessor’s historically low cap on refugees by next month, after initially moving only to expand the eligibility criteria for resettlements and getting swift blowback from allies in return.
In an emergency determination signed Friday, Biden stated the admission of up to 15,000 refugees set by President Donald Trump this year “remains justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.” But if the cap is reached before the end of the current budget year and the emergency refugee situation persists, then..."
"As the Senate prepares to take up her anti-Asian hate crime bill this week, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Monday the bill represents a chance for lawmakers to ""take a stand"" against rising anti-Asian attacks.
""At a time when the Asian America Pacific Islander community feels under siege and vulnerable, this is a bill that enables the Senate at least, and I know followed by the House, to take a stand and say these kinds of unprovoked attacks targeting Asian Americans are totally unacceptable,"" Hirono told the hosts of ABC's..."

"This summer, the American economic recovery hit a roadblock.
The US economy grew at an annualized rate of only 2% in the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday.
The highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus, supply chain chaos, worker shortages, sluggish jobs numbers and higher prices weighed on economic activity.
It was far lower than the 2.7% economists had predicted and the slowest pace of growth since the start of the recovery, as well as a massive step down from the 6.7% rate in the spring.
Aside from the monumental downturn in the first half of 2020, when the economy ground to..."
"Ten Republican senators on Sunday requested a meeting with President Biden to detail a smaller counterproposal to his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, an alternative they believe could be approved ""quickly by Congress with bipartisan support.""
Later Sunday, Biden invited the senators to the White House. The meeting is scheduled to take place at 5 p.m. ET Monday, and the White House said it would focus on how Biden's plan ""will deliver urgently needed relief to working families and small businesses, and speed up vaccinations and the reopening of schools.""..."
"President Joe Biden has agreed to meet a group of 10 Republican senators who have proposed a slimmed-down coronavirus relief plan that they say can win bipartisan support.
The Republicans' proposed package is much smaller than Biden's $1.9 trillion proposal, and includes $160 billion for vaccines, $4 billion for health and substance abuse services, the continuation of current unemployment aid and unspecified ""targeted"" economic assistance and help for schools.
The invitation came late Sunday after the senators requested the meeting.
""We appreciate the president’s quick response to our letter, and..."
"WASHINGTON — A federal watchdog agency is recommending that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway be fired for repeatedly violating a law that limits certain political activities of federal employees.
The U.S. Office of Special Counsel says Conway has become a “repeat offender” of the Hatch Act by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.
A White House spokesman calls the Office of Special Counsel’s actions “deeply flawed.”"
"The remaining structure left behind after the Miami building collapse has been brought down by demolition crews using explosives, after warnings that a tropical storm could render the site unsafe.
Rescue teams are expected to resume the search for survivors once the demolition is complete at the Champlain Towers South condo building. They have so far recovered the remains of 24 people, with 121 still missing.
No one has been pulled out of the rubble alive since the first hours after the 24 June collapse at Surfside in southern Florida.

"Rescuers were given the all-clear to resume work looking for victims at a collapsed South Florida condo building after demolition crews set off a string of explosives that brought down the last of the building in a plume of dust.
Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told the Associated Press that the demolition went “exactly as planned” around 10:30 p.m. Sunday.
Crews immediately began clearing some of the new debris so rescuers could start making their way into parts of the underground garage that is of particular interest. Once there,..."
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's comments about sexual harassment allegations in her party's own ranks touched off a fierce blowback not only from Republicans, but also from progressives, who said they feared it muddled the Democrats' message on misconduct by putting politics ahead of protecting women.
In an interview Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., offered supportive words for Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who has been accused of sexually harassing former members of his congressional staff and who reached a taxpayer-funded settlement with one accuser who said she..."
"Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., has announced he is stepping down as ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Conyers conveyed the news in a statement released Sunday by the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
The announcement comes roughly a week after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced publicly against the longest-serving member of the House. Those allegations were lodged by a former female employee, who had made a wrongful dismissal complaint against him that was settled two years ago."
"Over the long Labor Day weekend, an explosive fire in the Sierra Nevada and record-shattering heat accelerated the climate crisis unfolding in California. The fires this season have already burned more acres than during any other year on record — and there are still several months left in the fire season.
The wildfire media coverage over the three-day weekend and into Tuesday included horrifying images, footage, and accounts from those on the ground, and awestruck reporters onsite and in studios casting around for language that properly conveys the scope..."
"President Trump presents a problem to those who look at politics in terms of systematic ideologies. He is either disinclined or unable to lay out his agenda in that way. So perhaps it was inevitable that Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who does have a gift for thinking systematically, would be so often invoked by Mr. Trump’s opponents. They need him not just as a hate object but as a heuristic, too. There may never be a “Trumpism,” and unless one emerges, the closest we may come to..."
"The headlines this month have been alarming. “Steve Bannon’s obsession with a dark theory of history should be worrisome” (Business Insider). “Steve Bannon Believes The Apocalypse Is Coming And War Is Inevitable” (the Huffington Post). “Steve Bannon Wants To Start World War III” (the Nation). A common thread in these media reports is that President Trump’s chief strategist is an avid reader and that the book that most inspires his worldview is “The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy.”
I wrote that book with William Strauss back in 1997. It is..."
"White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon rarely appears in public and rarely speaks to the press, much less on live television. So his appearance alongside White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus Thursday was hotly anticipated and closely watched.
The men performed a buddy schtick of sorts, portraying the yin and yang that bring the White House together and keep it running not in chaos as some media reports have claimed, but like the ""fine-tuned"" machine President Donald Trump bragged about during a news conference last week. Priebus keeps the..."
"Several senior White House officials have begun discussing whether to push for a temporary payroll tax cut as a way to arrest an economic slowdown, three people familiar with the discussions said, revealing growing concerns about the economy among President Trump’s top economic aides.
The talks are still in their early stages and have included a range of other tax breaks. The officials also have not decided whether to formally push Congress to approve any of these measures, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were..."
"President Donald Trump is suggesting that he will fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after Tuesday’s election, as his rift with the nation’s top infectious disease expert widens while the nation sees its most alarming outbreak of the coronavirus since the spring.
Speaking at a campaign rally in Opa-locka, Florida, Trump expressed frustration that the surging cases of the virus that has killed more than 231,000 people in the United States this year remains prominent in the news, sparking chants of “Fire Fauci” from his supporters.
“Don’t tell anybody but let me..."
"President Donald Trump signaled early Monday morning that he may fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, after Election Day.
The suggestion from the president came just minutes after midnight at a campaign rally in Opa-locka, Fla., where Trump again claimed the United States was “rounding the turn” in its fight against the coronavirus, even though the country has set records in recent days for new cases.
Trump also complained that the media was overly focused on coverage of the pandemic — “you turn on the news,..."
"A New York Times and CBS News poll shows a tightening race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Less than two months before the general election, Clinton is supported by about 46 percent of likely voters, while Trump has the support of 44 percent. When considering all registered voters, Trump has only 41 percent, with Clinton holding the support of 46 percent."
"While Supreme Court watchers ponder how justices will come down in the debate over gay marriage, ABCs George Will said Sunday on ABC News “This Week its clear where public opinion is headed.
“There is something like an emerging consensus, Will said, noting voters in three states recently endorsed same-sex marriage initiatives. “Quite literally, the opposition to gay marriage is dying. Its old people.
Democratic strategist James Carville agreed the 2012 election marked a “profound shift on the controversial issue.

"Life moves fast these days, and so does the law.
In the civil rights era, the Supreme Court waited decades to weigh in on interracial marriage. On Friday, by contrast, the court did not hesitate to jump into the middle of one of the most important social controversies of the day, agreeing to hear two cases on same-sex marriage.
By taking both, the court gave itself the chance to issue a sweeping ruling that would cast aside bans on same-sex marriage nationwide. But the speed with which the court moved..."
"Half a century ago, the Supreme Court settled the matter of when a court can stop a newspaper from publishing. In 1971, the Nixon administration attempted to block The Times and The Washington Post from publishing classified Defense Department documents detailing the history of the Vietnam War — the so-called Pentagon Papers. Faced with an asserted threat to the nation’s security, the Supreme Court sided with the newspapers. “Without an informed and free press, there cannot be an enlightened people,” Justice Potter Stewart wrote in a concurring opinion.
That sentiment reflects..."
"President Joe Biden said Tuesday in a New York Times opinion piece that he would “provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.”
The announcement was part of a piece that explained the Biden administration’s goals in Ukraine: “[A] democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression.”
The White House National Security Council said Tuesday that the “more advanced rocket systems” were longer-range multiple-launch rocket systems. They are..."

While Clinton remains strikingly dominant in the Democratic field, the poll shows that her numbers have dropped significantly across several key indicators since she launched her campaign in April.
A growing number of people say she is not honest and trustworthy (57%, up from 49% in March), less than half feel she car"
"After five months of forums, fundraising appearances and trips to the early states, the 2016 Republican nomination contest is as unsettled as ever, with no candidate receiving more than 11 percent support and seven candidates all within three points of one another, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton continues to dominate the Democratic nomination contest. But her personal attributes continue to erode in the wake of stories about fundraising practices at the Clinton Foundation and her use of a personal e-m"

But amid all the revelry there was also a lot of tragedy as at least 150 people were killed by gun violence across the country throughout the weekend, reports CNN, citing data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive.

"On Saturday, Democrats quickly criticized President Donald Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, arguing that her confirmation would put millions of Americans’ health insurance in jeopardy.
In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden focused on Coney Barrett’s “written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act.” Her criticism of the decision is particularly important because the court is scheduled to hear a major challenge to the healthcare law the week after the November election.

"President Obama and Congressional leaders on Friday reopened budget negotiations that ended badly in 2011 with surprising bipartisan bonhomie, and even some initial agreements toward a year-end deal. Yet a familiar hurdle remains before any handshakes: resolving the parties dispute over whether to extend the Bush-era tax rates for the wealthy."
"(CNN) - Despite the Trump White House's insistence that the President has been vindicated and exonerated by the Senate vote to not remove him from office, acquittal does not mean exoneration in an impeachment trial.
Trump's acquittal in the Senate was always a foregone conclusion. No American president has been removed from office as a result of a Senate trial. In their wisdom, the founders placed the bar at an appropriately high two-thirds.
Nonetheless, impeachment will be in the first paragraph of Trump's obituary. It puts him in a permanent..."
"The Three Percenters’ Oregon chapter has gotten involved in the Oregon standoff between Republican state senators, who fled the state to avoid the passage of cap-and-trade legislation, and the Democratic majority who wanted to put the measure to a vote.

"A State of the Union address is often difficult to fact-check, no matter who is president. The speech is a product of many hands and is carefully vetted, so major errors of fact are relatively rare. But State of the Union addresses often are very political speeches, an argument for the president’s policies, so context is sometimes missing."

But the talks dragged on for months with negotiators remaining at odds over..."
"President Trump has said repeatedly that Russian interference didn't matter in the 2016 presidential campaign, and he has suggested — wrongly — that the intelligence and law enforcement communities have said the same. His overriding fear seems to be that Russian interference and the “fake news” it promoted would undermine the legitimacy of his election win."
"In an unusual statement released early Tuesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the independent board that reviews data from multiple Covid-19 vaccine candidates has raised concerns about AstraZeneca's announcement of efficacy data from its vaccine trial.
""The DSMB expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,"" said the NIAID statement released early Tuesday.
""We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most..."
"The Senate has voted to begin work on a nearly $1 trillion national infrastructure plan, acting with sudden speed after weeks of fits and starts once the White House and a bipartisan group of senators agreed on major provisions of the package that’s key to President Joe Biden’s agenda.
Biden welcomed the accord as one that would show America can “do big things.” It includes the most significant long-term investments in nearly a century, he said, on par with building the transcontinental railroad or the Interstate highway system.
“This deal signals to..."
"Boris Johnson will become Britain’s next prime minister after winning a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative party leadership race.
The former mayor of London, who has long cherished an ambition to lead his country, won 66% of the votes – 92,153, to Hunt’s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among 159,320 party members.
In a characteristically lighthearted acceptance speech, Johnson conceded that even some of his own supporters may “wonder quite what they have done”.
He claimed the Tory party had historically demonstrated it could “manage the jostling instincts..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci said vaccines won't be available to the ""general public"" before mid- to late May or early June, he told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Tuesday.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that previous estimates had placed vaccine availability for the general public -- or nonessential workers under 65 with no health conditions -- closer to the end of April.
""If you start talking about when the vaccine would be more widely available to the general population, I was hoping that that would..."
"Following the announcement by the VA inspector general that his office is investigating possible misconduct at 26 VA facilities around the country, President Barack Obama promised to swiftly root out anyone responsible.
“If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is a disgrace and I will not tolerate it. Period,” Mr. Obama said during a White House press conference. “I will not stand for it. Not as commander-in-chief, but also not as an American,” he added. “None of us should.”

"California, the state that buys the most cars and trucks in the United States, will ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles by 2035. This represents the largest government move against gasoline and diesel to date, with the potential to ripple throughout the country and the global auto industry.
The California Air Resources Board, which regulates pollution in the state, voted unanimously on Thursday to approve a proposal that will require 100 percent of all cars sold in the state to produce zero greenhouse gas emissions in 13 years. The board is..."
"It contends that California laws on the tenure, seniority and dismissal of teachers violate the Constitution because they don't ensure all students have access to an adequate education. Local school districts, state legislators and even a California governor have tried to limit teachers' job protections, among the most generous in the country. Efforts have all failed to rid public schools of ineffective teachers by making it easier to fire them and tougher for them to gain tenure and by stripping them of seniority rights. Now proponents are taking their fight..."
"President Barack Obama is making an Earth Day visit to Florida's Everglades on Wednesday, where he'll talk about environmental issues. It's of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call ahead of the trip that Obama ""will use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes..."
"President Barack Obama made an unexpected appearance at Friday's White House press briefing to talk about the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case and, more broadly, how the United States continues to grapple with racial bias.
""When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said."
"President Barack Obama on Thursday effectively placed his diplomatic legacy largely in the hands of Iranian revolutionary clerics who've waged a proxy war against the U.S. for three decades.
With a framework deal to halt Tehran's nuclear program, Obama moved closer to the kind of staggering diplomatic breakthrough with the Islamic Republic that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.
If the political agreement reached in Switzerland turns into a genuine pact honored by both sides, Obama will be entitled to a place in history as the leader..."
"On the day he took office, President Obama reached out to America’s enemies, offering in his first inaugural address to “extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.” More than six years later, he has arrived at a moment of truth in testing that proposition with one of the nation’s most intransigent adversaries.
The framework nuclear agreement he reached with Iran on Thursday did not provide the definitive answer to whether Mr. Obama’s audacious gamble will pay off. The fist Iran has shaken at the so-called Great..."
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump looks back on his best days in the White House, Tuesday may land near the top of the list.
With Democrats in disarray at the start of their nominating season, Mr. Trump will take the national stage to address his largest audience of the year assured of acquittal in his Senate trial and enjoying his highest public approval since taking office.
For a president impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors just seven weeks ago, he finds himself in a strikingly strong position as his re-election..."
"I used to think it was enough, every Thanksgiving, to post Wednesday Addams’ famous Thanksgiving monologue. Like most Indian kids across the country, when I first saw “Addams Family Values,” I delighted in the speech delivered by the iconic little outcast. It was one of the first times I remember feeling seen in pop culture as she rants about the realities of reservations and settler/colonial violence, about selling beaded bracelets by the roadside. Her statement about living in mobile homes resonated so intensely with me that I think my 10-year-old..."
"It has been 10 months since unsealed federal court documents revealed that U.S. immigration officials created a fake university to lure foreign-born college students who were trying to stay in the country on student visas that might not have been legal.
The University of Farmington, a fictitious school that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement marketed as a hub for STEM students who wanted to enroll and not “interrupt their careers,” had a fake name, a fake website and a fake motto on its fake seal. “Scientia et Labor,” the seal..."
"DETROIT – About 90 additional foreign students at a fake university in metro Detroit created by the Department of Homeland Security have been arrested in recent months.
A total of about 250 students have now been arrested since January on immigration violations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of a sting operation by federal agents who enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India, to attend the school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies, according to ICE officials.
Many of those arrested have..."
"As three former presidents gathered in Atlanta last week to offer stirring tributes to John Lewis, President Trump was absent. In an interview that aired Monday night, Trump had few kind words of his own for the former Democratic congressman and civil rights leader, who died July 17.
Asked by interviewer Jonathan Swan how history would remember Lewis’s contributions to the nation, Trump demurred.
“I don’t know. I don’t know John Lewis,” Trump said in the “Axios on HBO” interview. “He chose not to come to my inauguration.”"
"The trail that led American officials to blame North Korea for the destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November winds back to 2010, when the National Security Agency scrambled to break into the computer systems of a country considered one of the most impenetrable targets on earth.
Spurred by growing concern about North Korea’s maturing capabilities, the American spy agency drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North..."
"Over the weekend, President Donald Trump shared two posts that falsely claimed COVID-19 deaths are not as high as previously thought.
The posts claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its COVID-19 death numbers to show that only 9,210 Americans have died from the virus. Twitter removed the first tweet for violating its rules. Another post from Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser for the Trump campaign, linked to a story from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative news site. That tweet was still up as of..."
"The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS."
"The Supreme Court declined Monday to revive an Arizona law that would have prohibited most abortions after a pregnancy had reached 20 weeks.
The court, as is its custom, gave no reason for declining to review a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that the law was unconstitutional because it violated standards set by the justices 40 years ago in Roe v. Wade."
"The way to stop Russia from annexing any more of Ukraine’s territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday, is for Western countries to announce that they would ban all Russian citizens in response.
In a wide-ranging interview with The Washington Post, Zelensky said that “the most important sanctions are to close the borders — because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land.” He said Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy.”
Russian leaders have signaled they could hold annexation votes in the occupied parts of..."
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The closely-watched special U.S. House election being held here Tuesday is taking place in the shadow of a political scandal that, according to the candidates, is having a real impact on the race.
But this time around, the issue is not the illegal ballot harvesting that marred last year's contest, it's the fact the one of the candidates has been effectively running for over two years.
Democratic candidate Dan McCready likes to tell his supporters that he began running for the 9th Congressional District seat when his..."
"  Inflation kept up its blistering pace in February, and economists say Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is triggering even steeper price increases this month. 
The Labor Department reported Thursday that the Consumer Price Index, or CPI — a broad basket of goods and services — continued to rise, increasing by 0.8 percent in February, or 7.9 percent year over year, on track with economists’ expectations. 
Core inflation rose by 0.5 percent for the month. The core inflation metric includes prices of goods and services from rent to airline tickets to..."
"Pressure on America’s central bank to raise interest rates has intensified after rising energy costs, supply shortages and increased consumer sent US inflation surging to a level not seen for more than 30 years.
Although the Federal Reserve has repeatedly insisted price pressures will prove “transitory”, financial markets were taken aback by a 6.2% increase in the cost of living in the world’s biggest economy over the past year.
A labour department report released on Wednesday showed prices rose by 0.9% in October alone – more than double the 0.4% jump in September –..."
"Italians cast their ballots in a national election that could bring the country’s most right-wing government to power since World War II.
The electoral campaign kicked off after political infighting led to the collapse of outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in July.

"The mammoth cargo ship blocking one of the world’s most vital maritime arteries was wrenched from the shoreline and finally set free on Monday, raising hopes that traffic could soon resume in the Suez Canal and limit the economic fallout of the disruption.
Salvage teams, working on land and water for six days and nights, were ultimately assisted by forces more powerful than any machine rushed to the scene: the moon and the tides.
The ship was ultimately set free at around 3 p.m., according to shipping officials. Horns blared..."
"One of the largest ships in the world was refloated and moving through the Suez Canal on Monday after being grounded for almost a week, authorities said.
Hopes heightened that hundreds of waiting ships would soon be sailing through the crucial global waterway. A salvage team was pulling the vessel toward the Great Bitter Lake, a wider stretch of water in the middle of the canal where the ship will undergo technical inspection, canal authorities said.

"As hospitals across the United States brace for a difficult six months — with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic still raging and concerns about a second wave in the fall — some are acutely short-staffed because of an ill-timed change to immigration policy and its inconsistent implementation.
A proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on June 22, barring the entry of most immigrants on work visas, came right as hospitals were expecting a new class of medical residents. Hundreds of young doctors were unable to start their residencies..."
"The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of a slowdown, according to new data from Glassdoor.
Job openings in the U.S. increased just 1.4% from the same period last year, according to the employment site’s June 2019 Job Market Report.
“The continued growth in jobs and pay seen in Glassdoor’s latest Job Market Report is a sign that the good times aren’t over yet. But after a decade-long recovery, today’s labor market is sluggish,” Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao said in a statement."

"A 76-year-old Michigan law crafted in the wake of Detroit race riots and used more recently to combat a generational health crisis is officially dead.   
The Republican-controlled state House on Wednesday voted 60-48 largely along party lines in support of initiative petition language that repeals the Emergency Powers Act of 1945. The vote came one week after the state Senate also approved the initiative. 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer used the law to issue sweeping health and safety restrictions in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, moves that eventually garnered pushback from Republicans..."
"Republican lawmakers on Wednesday killed a law that underpinned coronavirus restrictions issued by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, wiping it from the books after Michigan’s Supreme Court declared the measure unconstitutional.
The Democrat is powerless to veto the citizen-initiated bill. A conservative group that organized the ballot drive next plans to target a public health law that enabled Whitmer’s administration to keep intact capacity restrictions and mask requirements for eight additional months until voluntarily lifting them in June after infections subsided amid vaccinations.
The GOP-led House voted 60-48 to repeal the 1945..."
"After a year of virtual school, students and parents alike were excited for the return of in-person learning. But just as quickly as the new school year started, many children were sent back home after a slew of COVID-19 outbreaks forced them into quarantine. 
In Florida, school districts around the state, including in Jacksonville's Duval County, are closing schools as cases rise. New Orleans School District saw 299 active COVID-19 cases and more than 3,000 students and staff in quarantine, according to district data.

"The U.S. added more than 1 million people to its Covid-19 case count on Monday as the true scope of a surge in infections over the holidays began to round into view.
The highly mutated variant, combined with delayed reporting by local governments over the holidays, led to a single-day record for new cases for any country in the world. Monday’s number is almost double the previous mark of about 590,000 set just four days ago in the U.S., which itself was a doubling from the prior week.

The U.S. has broken several of its own COVID-19 records in recent days. Last week, Johns Hopkins reported more than 480,000 new cases in a single day, more than double the number of daily cases reported during the peak of the delta surge. The seven-day average topped 280,000.

"Huge, multi-mile traffic jams at numerous U.S. border crossings in Mexico worsened Wednesday as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) largely kept in place his new restrictions that require secondary inspections of commercial trucks and other vehicles.
The new policy, announced last week, has led some truckers to remain snarled in traffic for more than 30 hours, prompting desperate pleas from fruit and vegetable importers, the auto industry and other executives who said their products are being caught up in a political standoff."

"In recent weeks, mask mandates across the country have been dropped as covid case rates and hospitalizations have fallen with the waning of the omicron wave. Everyone hopes that even if the virus never completely disappears, it could become merely endemic and not the dominant reality of everyday life that it has been for two years.
Yet there are signs a new wave could be on its way, now that one is already hitting Europe. Should that happen, Democrats ought to know that they’ll get the blame.
Right now, Democrats don’t appear all..."
"The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, according to an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito circulated inside the court and obtained by POLITICO.
The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching repudiation of the 1973 decision which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights and a subsequent 1992 decision – Planned Parenthood v. Casey – that largely maintained the right. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito writes."
"On Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced that she would be essentially gutting Obama-era Title IX sexual assault protections. Implemented in 2011 during President Obama's term, the protections and guidelines were lauded by advocates and sexual assault survivors as a step forward. But these guidelines have been controversial from the start with critics saying that they infringe on the rights of those accused of sexual assault. If you vehemently disagree with DeVos' decision, here's how to argue about Title IX."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday attempted to distance himself from a boisterous ""send her back"" chant aimed at Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that occurred at his campaign rally Wednesday night.
""I was not happy with it — I disagree with it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, adding, ""I didn't say that, they did.""
The chant broke out among rally-goers in North Carolina after the president went on an extended rant about Omar and three of her House colleagues — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ayanna..."
"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump blamed his supporters Thursday for a chant of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally, even though he did nothing to stop the taunts against a black lawmaker.
""I disagree with it,” the president told reporters a day later in the Oval Office. ""I wasn't happy with that message.""
Pressed further, Trump suggested that reporters return to North Carolina to ask why supporters began the chant during Wednesday's rally. The audience broke into the chant in the middle of a lengthy..."
"In his new book The Right, conservative journalist Matthew Continetti describes the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot as the decisive event in Donald Trump’s presidency: one that transformed it from what he sees as a largely successful enterprise into a disastrous one.
“If Trump had followed the example of his predecessors and conceded power graciously, he would have been remembered as a disruptive but consequential populist leader,” Continetti writes. “Instead, when historians write about the Trump era, they will do so through the lens of January 6.”
If polling data is anything to..."
"Secretary of State John Kerry’s rebuke of the Israeli government on Wednesday set off a wave of criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Republicans denounced what they said was the Obama administration’s harsh treatment of a steadfast ally and Democrats signaled that they were uneasy with Mr. Kerry’s pressure on Israel, even as they praised the effort to promote Middle East peace.
In Europe, however, Mr. Kerry’s speech was greeted warmly, with officials calling it a courageous and thoughtful effort to salvage the idea of a two-state solution for the..."

Joe Manchin that has come under sharp criticism from Republicans and liberals – pushback that could be enough to sink the vote and push Congress to the brink of a shutdown.
Lawmakers are still expected to pass a short-term funding extension by week’s end, but they will likely run right up against the deadline of Friday at midnight when funding expires.
The Senate is..."
"Voters in North Texas delivered an upset Tuesday, picking GOP state Rep. Jake Ellzey to fill a vacant House seat over a candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump.
Ellzey beat fellow Republican Susan Wright, the widow of former Rep. Ron Wright, 53 percent to 47 percent, when the Associated Press called the low-turnout, Republican-vs.-Republican runoff. Though Ellzey was better funded, Wright leaned heavily on her backing from the former president, who often plays kingmaker in Republican primaries.

"Mitch McConnell pointedly declared “case closed” on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation on Tuesday, in an extended partisan riff mocking Democrats for being fixated on bringing down President Donald Trump and being slow to respond to Russian election threats.
The GOP leader offered little defense of the Mueller report’s depiction of Trump repeatedly trying to derail the investigation, instead saying that it was time to move on to other issues and that Democrats were “angry that our legal system will not magically undo the 2016 election.”"
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is declaring “case closed” on the Russia probe and potential obstruction by President Donald Trump.
The Republican leader, in his most significant public comments yet on the investigation, is expected to outline in a Tuesday speech how special counsel Robert Mueller’s “exhaustive” probe went on for two years and is now complete. The remarks are being billed as his final thoughts on the topic.

"President Joe Biden on Friday fired the commissioner of Social Security after the official refused to resign, and Biden accepted the deputy commissioner’s resignation, the White House said.
Biden asked commissioner Andrew Saul to resign, and his employment was terminated after he refused the Democratic president’s request, a White House official said.

"President Biden on Friday fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul, a holdover from the Trump administration who had alienated crucial Democratic constituencies with policies designed to clamp down benefits and an uncompromising anti-union stance.
Saul was fired after refusing a request to resign, White House officials said. His deputy, David Black, who was also appointed by former president Donald Trump, resigned Friday upon request.
Biden named Kilolo Kijakazi, the current deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy, to serve as acting commissioner until a permanent nominee is selected."
"Glenn Beck may not want to vote for Hillary Clinton, but he is convinced that she will win the presidency in 2016.

"He may have once called President Barack Obama the racist puppet of a vast global conspiracy, but conservative talk show host Glenn Beck seems to be more sanguine about his potential replacement, Hillary Clinton.
Beck, who left Fox News in 2011 to start his own media empire, predicted this week that the former secretary of state will be the next president, and not through any kind of trickery or skullduggery.
“Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States,” he said on his radio show Monday, citing a..."

"The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level since the pandemic began, a sign the job market is still improving even as hiring has slowed in the past two months.
Unemployment claims dropped 36,000 to 293,000 last week, the second straight drop, the Labor Department said Thursday. That’s the smallest number of people to apply for benefits since the week of March 14, 2020, when the pandemic intensified, and the first time claims have dipped below 300,000. Applications for jobless aid, which generally track the..."
"About 960,000 workers filed for unemployment insurance last week, which marks the first time that initial claims dipped below one million since mid-March, when the coronavirus pandemic first took hold and economic lockdowns forced workers home.
The weekly claims figure for the week ending Aug. 8 dropped fell below the 1.18 million claims from last week, but remains well above historic highs. The pre-pandemic record for initial weekly claims was 695,000, from 1982, another recession."
"The number of laid-off workers applying for unemployment aid fell below 1 million last week for the first time since the pandemic intensified five months ago yet still remains at a high level. The viral pandemic keeps forcing layoffs just as the expiration of a $600-a-week federal jobless benefit has deepened the hardships for many.
The Labor Department said applications fell to 963,000, the second straight drop, from 1.2 million the previous week. The decline suggests that layoffs are slowing, though last week’s figure still exceeds the pre-pandemic record of..."

"The Supreme Court cleared the way Wednesday for the release of presidential records from the Trump White House to a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
The court's order means that more than 700 documents will be transferred to Congress that could shed light on the events leading up to the insurrection when hundreds of rioters converged on the Capitol attempting to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results.
Only Justice Clarence Thomas said publicly that he would have granted former President Donald Trump's request..."
"NEW YORK — President Trump’s new executive order was the talk of the night at a gala Thursday for religious freedom advocates at the Pierre Hotel, located just blocks from Trump Tower. Sipping cocktails and eating crab cake and salmon hors d’oeuvres, guests appeared divided over whether Trump’s order should be viewed as a clear win or a steep disappointment."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump will have their microphones muted during portions of the second and final presidential debate on Thursday night, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Monday in a decision that will likely anger the President.
The decision came after the commission met Monday afternoon to discuss potential rule changes to the debate format. They decided that the changes were needed because of how the first debate between Biden and Trump devolved into chaos, with the President frequently interrupting the former vice president."
"Friday’s massacre exemplified the problem of expecting tech companies to self-police content.
The hate-filled terror rampage at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was meticulously designed to maximize the number of witnesses around the globe, highlighting the difficulty in putting a lid on extremist hate that spreads online.

"Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, ripped into Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Monday during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing, tying the nominee to a wide range of conservative grievances. But the lawmaker’s accusations appeared to often be based on quotes taken out of context. Here’s a closer look at some of her apparent sources.
Blackburn linked Jackson to the controversy over transgender athletes and women’s sports.
Ms. Blackburn portrayed as excessive the progressive push for transgender rights, decrying a recent victory at the N.C.A.A. swimming championships by a transgender female..."
"Texas' controversial abortion law will remain in place for the time being, after a federal appeals court on Thursday granted the state's request to suspend a federal judge's ruling that barred it from being enforced. The brief ruling is a blow to abortion rights advocates, who had hoped to suspend the law for as long as possible while its constitutionality is debated in the courts. 
The three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1. The Department of Justice, which sued Texas over the law, is able to appeal the..."
"Texas can continue banning most abortions after a federal appeals court rejected the Biden administration’s latest attempt to stop a novel law that has become the nation’s biggest curb to abortion in nearly 50 years.
The decision Thursday could push the law closer to returning to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has already once allowed the restrictions to take effect without ruling on its constitutionality. The Texas law bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant.
Since the law took effect in..."

"Monday is the first Tax Day under the new rules of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but Americans have been adapting to the law since it passed in late 2017.
Some of its effects are already visible, and some of them will take months, or even years, to understand. After all, economists are still publishing studies about the effect of the last comprehensive tax overhaul back in 1986, signed by Ronald Reagan.
Here's what we can — and can't — say about how President Donald Trump's tax cuts have..."
"Republicans passed a sweeping tax cut for two-thirds of Americans in 2017, saying it would pay for itself and the American public would thank them.
Now, as Americans finish filing to the IRS for the first time under the new system, the law has swelled the deficit and surveys show just one-fifth of taxpayers believe their taxes have gone down. That’s made it hard for President Donald Trump to leverage the tax cuts as an issue in 2020, when he’s up for reelection and his party will be seeking to..."

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s business economists have sharply raised their forecasts for inflation, predicting an extension of the price spikes that have resulted in large part from bottlenecked supply chains.
A survey released Monday by the National Association for Business Economics found that its panel of forecasters expects consumer prices to rise 6% this quarter compared with a year ago. That marks an increase from the 5.1% inflation the forecasters predicted in September for the same 12-month period.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin just got what he’s wanted from a recent vote: the veneer of a popular mandate on a plan that allows him to stay in power far beyond his current term limit — and could essentially make him president for life.
On July 1, Russia tallied the results of a week-long national vote on a slew of constitutional reforms, including a constitutional amendment that allows Putin to nix term limits and remain president until 2036. Such an outcome was expected, and largely predetermined, given Russia’s long track..."

"Over the past three weeks, young female protesters in Iran have led the biggest show of resistance against the country’s theocratic regime in more than a decade. US and European leaders have rightly voiced support for them. As the regime intensifies its brutal response, the West should do what it can to ensure the movement survives.
The eruption of anger was sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, who died in custody of Iran’s “morality police” after she was arrested for allegedly flouting local dress codes...."
"There's an eerie sense of calm in Britain this Thursday.
After weeks of bitter name-calling, raucous political debate and media saturation of the UK general election, the airwaves are oddly serene owing to strict rules about what broadcasters can and cannot say on election day.
As millions of voters trudge to polling stations in schools, church halls and even country inns, top television and radio news programs are filled with the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake and the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan."

"In a moment when President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders sought to create desperately needed momentum to pass key parts of the President's agenda, everything appeared to turn in the exact opposite direction.
Biden's meetings with two key Democratic moderates yielded nothing in the form of a tangible -- and absolutely necessary -- public commitment or acknowledgment of their preferred path forward.

Any agreement “doesn’t"
"The problem isn't that President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu don't get along, although they don't. The problem spotlighted in the Capitol on Tuesday is that they fundamentally disagree on whether an emerging nuclear deal with Iran would make the world safer or more dangerous.
The personal rift could be papered over or ultimately resolved when one leader or both leaves office."

Liberty's board of trustees accepted his resignation Tuesday, effective immediately, the university said in a statement, after receiving a resignation letter from Falwell late Monday night.
His resignation marks an ignominious end to his 13-year run as Liberty president that began when his televangelist father who founded the university,..."

Every election provokes some level of stress among voters, but mental health professionals say that the polarization of this year’s presidential race appeared to have amplified the tension."
"The White House sharply criticized Donald Trump on Wednesday over an interview in which the former president said that Vladimir Putin should release potentially damaging information about Hunter Biden.
“What kind of American, let alone an ex-president, thinks that this is the right time to enter into a scheme with Vladimir Putin and brag about his connections to Vladimir Putin?” said Kate Bedingfield, a White House spokesperson, when asked by reporters. “There is only one, and it’s Donald Trump.”"
"If Don McGahn's testimony produces new evidence against President Donald Trump, the panel could consider ""whether to recommend new articles of impeachment.""
Lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee floated the possibility that the panel could take up additional articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, according to a document filed in a federal appeals court Monday.
Urging the court to compel former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify, the committee's lawyers said that his testimony could lead to more revelations about the president's behavior.
“If McGahn’s testimony produces new..."
"As tensions on the streets here seemed to ease on Thursday, Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from the city.
“I greatly appreciate the men and women of the Missouri National Guard for successfully carrying out the specific, limited mission of protecting the Unified Command Center so that law enforcement officers could focus on the important work of increasing communication within the community, restoring trust, and protecting the people and property of Ferguson,” Mr. Nixon said in a statement."
"President Donald Trump, facing harsh criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for his abrupt decisions on Syria, claimed a ""breakthrough"" on Wednesday, saying the ceasefire on Turkey's border with Syria is ""permanent.""
""Early this morning, the Government of Turkey ... said that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, making the ceasefire permanent, and it will indeed be permanent,"" Trump said in a formal statement from the White House.
Trump said sanctions the U.S. imposed on Turkey would be lifted unless something ""happens that we're not happy..."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said parents should have ""some measure of choice"" when it comes to vaccinating their children.
Christie, speaking to reporters during a three-day trip to the United Kingdom, said all four of his children have been vaccinated, but noted he thinks a parent's opinion about the issue is more important than what a public official thinks.
“Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated and we think that it’s an important part of being sure"
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took a measured approach wading into the debate over vaccines sparked by a measles outbreak in the United States, saying that while he vaccinates his own children, parents should be able to choose.
""All I can say is that we vaccinate ours. I think it's much more important as a parent than as a public official, and that's what we do,"" he told reporters during his trip to England on Monday. He went on to say that's ""part of making sure we protect their health..."
"LONDON — Scandal-ridden British Prime Minister Boris Johnson capitulated to mounting pressure to step down Thursday, announcing his decision after days of high-profile government resignations and calls from fellow Conservative Party members to quit.
“In the past few weeks, I have been trying to convince my colleagues it would be eccentric to change governments when we have achieved so much,” he said in his speech outside No. 10 Downing St. amid loud booing from the crowd nearby. “I regret not to be successful in those arguments and, of course, it’s painful not..."
"He was the mayor who basked in the glory of hosting the 2012 London Olympics, and the man who led the Conservatives to a thumping election victory on the back of his promise to “get Brexit done.”
But Boris Johnson’s time as prime minister was marred by his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and a steady stream of ethics allegations, from alcohol-fueled government parties that broke lockdown rules to how he handled a sexual misconduct scandal involving a senior party lawmaker.
Here is a timeline of events relating to Johnson’s political career:
2001-2008:..."
"Police officers in Ferguson, Mo., have routinely violated the constitutional rights of the city’s black residents, the Justice Department has concluded in a scathing report that accuses the officers of using excessive force and making unjustified traffic stops for years.
The Justice Department, which opened its investigation after a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed a black teenager last summer, says the discrimination was fueled in part by racial stereotypes held by city officials. Investigators say the officials made racist jokes about blacks on their city email a"
"A Justice Department review has found that the troubled Ferguson Police Department engaged in a pattern of racially biased enforcement during suspect stops and used unreasonable force against a disproportionate number of African American suspects, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the findings
In 88% of cases in which Ferguson police documented the use of force, that force was used against African Americans, according to the official who is not authorized to comment publicly. In addition, in all 14 canine bite incidents for which information about the race..."
"After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.
The proposed global legal settlement has gotten preliminary approval from the major parties involved, according to several of the lawyers. More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who in lawsuits have..."
"Election deniers and elected officials who back rioters from the Jan. 6 insurrection are responsible for eroding the United States’ reputation on the world stage, Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” set to air Sunday.
“Through the process of what we’ve been through, we’re starting to allow people to call into question our commitment to those principles,” Harris said. “And that’s a shame.”
The remark was in response to a question by host Chuck Todd about the message that internal threats to American..."
"“We followed the president’s orders,” Sondland says.
Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, is testifying to the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday morning in the highest-stakes impeachment hearing yet — and his opening statement has now been released.
In it, Sondland confirms that there was a “quid pro quo” imposed on Ukraine, and says that he was carrying out the “orders” of President Donald Trump.
Sondland faced intense criticism for omissions and purported failures of recollection in his October closed-door testimony, and he already submitted an “addendum” to..."
"U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirmed Wednesday the existence of a ""quid pro quo"" in which military aid to Ukraine was tied to President Donald Trump's call for an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden.
Sondland, testifying on Capitol Hill in the Trump impeachment inquiry, said he was acting on Trump's orders in his actions with regard to Ukraine.
He said, ""At all times, I was acting in good faith. As a presidential appointee, I followed the directions of the President.""
Sondland said Trump lawyer Rudy..."
"After a pause on investigations of families seeking gender-affirming care for their transgender children, the Texas Supreme Court said the state’s child protective services investigations can continue while an appeals process plays out on the merits of the case.
The opinion released Friday still restricts the state from investigating the so-called “Doe” family, which brought forward a lawsuit against the state in March after the family was investigated by the Department of Family and Protective Services for seeking care for their trans teen.
And significantly, the opinion also denied that Gov. Greg Abbott..."
"The Republican Party on Friday officially declared the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and events that led to it “legitimate political discourse,” and rebuked two lawmakers in the party who have been most outspoken in condemning the deadly riot and the role of Donald J. Trump in spreading the election lies that fueled it.
The Republican National Committee’s voice vote to censure Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois at its winter meeting in Salt Lake City culminated more than a year of vacillation, which started with party..."
White House press secretary Jay Carney suggested Tuesday that GOP Sens. Ted Cruz Mike Lee and Rand Paul are out of step with the public on gun-control measures. The three lawmakers have threatened to filibuster quotany legislation that will serve as a vehicle for any additional gun restrictions.rdquo Carney said he hasn39t spoken with President...
"Iran struck a hard line Tuesday after just one day of restarted talks in Vienna over its tattered nuclear deal, suggesting everything discussed in previous rounds of diplomacy could be renegotiated.
Speaking to Iranian state television, Ali Bagheri, Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, referred to everything discussed thus far as merely a “draft.” It remained unclear whether that represented an opening gambit by Iran’s new president or signaled serious trouble for those hoping to restore the 2015 deal that saw Tehran strictly limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the..."
"Europe’s energy crisis loomed larger Friday after Russian energy giant Gazprom said it couldn’t resume the supply of natural gas through a key pipeline to Germany for now, citing what it said was a need for urgent maintenance work to repair key components, just hours before it was due to restart deliveries.
The Russian state-run energy company had shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Wednesday for what it said would be three days of maintenance.
It said in a social media post Friday evening that it had identified..."
"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is suspending her longshot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination and throwing her support behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the Hawaii congresswoman announced on Thursday.
“I owe you an incredible debt of gratitude for all you’ve done as the heart and soul of our people-powered campaign: Today, I’ve made the decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency,” Gabbard said in a note to her campaign’s supporters. Gabbard, who is not running for reelection to Congress, pointed to the coronavirus pandemic as part of her motivation..."
"The branding of Vladimir Putin as a war criminal by Joe Biden, who lobbied for the Iraq war and staunchly supported the 20 years of carnage in the Middle East, is one more example of the hypocritical moral posturing sweeping across the United States. It is unclear how anyone would try Putin for war crimes since Russia, like the United States, does not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. But justice is not the point. Politicians like Biden, who do not accept responsibility for our well-documented..."
"The deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, was ""likely preventable"" based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings that the security situation there was deteriorating, the majority of the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in a report released on Wednesday.
Separately, the findings also noted what the FBI had told the panel -- that 15 people cooperating with its investigation had been killed in Benghazi, undercutting the investigation. It was not clear if the killings were related to the probe.
Moreover, it said that people..."
"On January 15, 2014, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a bipartisan review of its findings in an investigation of the September 11, 2012, attacks on an American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya. Much of the report dispels myths perpetuated by Fox News over the last sixteen months."
"The bad news for President Obama: its been almost a week since the second presidential debate, in Hempstead, N.Y., one that instant-reaction polls said was a narrow victory for him. But there is little sign that this has translated into a bounce for Mr. Obama in his head-to-head polls against Mitt Romney. Instead, the presidential race may have settled into a period of relative stability.
There"
"The House of Representatives voted Friday to pass Democrats' $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill, in a significant victory for President Joe Biden and his party.
Now that the Democratic-controlled House has approved the bill, it will next go to Biden to be signed into law.
Final passage of the bill marks a milestone for Democrats and gives the party a chance to achieve long-sought policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. It comes at a critical time as Democrats are fighting to retain control of narrow..."
"On Wednesday morning, not even 24 hours after Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination, Paul Ryan convened his top advisers for a call. With Congress out of session, Ryan was bouncing between multiple states, raising the piles of money needed to keep House Republicans in the majority."
"If, as widely predicted, the GOP captures the Senate in today’s elections, what difference will it make for Congress’s legislative performance in the coming two years? Gerald Seib argues that legislative agreements will become more likely since, “When power is evenly split in Washington, both parties have to temper their policies.” Jonathan Chait suggests that “the race to control the Senate is not about … passing legislation of any kind. … It is possible, though highly unlikely, that some bills will pass in the next Congress.”"
"GoFundMe will automatically refund all donations made to a multi-million dollar campaign for a group of Canadian truckers protesting vaccine mandates, the fundraising platform announced Saturday, after it started to face fierce backlash from right-wing figures and Republican politicians over its decision to remove the online campaign.
The decision to remove the campaign page from its platform came Friday after the company said the demonstrations being funded by the campaign had become an occupation, sparking incidents of violence and other illegal activity.
On Friday, the company asked donors to submit a request for a..."
"One Christmas long ago when I was a college student far from my family, I couldn’t afford to fly home. I had a roommate who for different reasons wasn’t going home either, and she and I made plans to go to a Christmas Eve party and on Christmas Day, cross-country ski and make a big dinner. Except my roommate fought with the guy she liked and drank way too much at the party, was sick most of the night and felt too sad and awful even to get out of..."
"Several thousand people marched through the Czech capital on Sunday, protesting a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for certain groups including people age 60 and over.
The participants didn’t wear face coverings or follow social distancing rules despite a request by police to do so. One person was detained.
The protesters, chanting “Freedom!” alleged their constitutional rights are being violated. They said they weren’t against voluntary vaccination but opposed a vaccine mandate.
The outgoing government released an order this week, making vaccination mandatory for the 60 and over age group, as well as medical..."
"Tens of thousands gathered in Austria’s capital Vienna to protest mandatory COVID vaccines and home confinement orders for those who have not yet received the jab.
Police said an estimated 44,000 people attended the demonstration on Saturday, the latest in a string of huge weekend protests since Austria last month became the first EU country to say it would make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory.
A partial confinement since last month ends on Sunday for the vaccinated, but those who have not received the required doses will have to remain at home.
“No to..."
"Inflation doesn't matter.
That's the message Democratic leaders are sending as they try to push more than $4 trillion into the economy to build infrastructure, fight climate change and ease the financial cost of child and elder care for families.
President Joe Biden says the 5.4 percent increase in the price of a basket of goods over the 12 months that ended in June is ""temporary,"" and a private White House presentation obtained by NBC News encourages Democratic lawmakers to focus on how Biden's plan ""lowers costs for working families rather than how it gets people..."
"Even with the results of the presidential contest still out, there’s a clear loser in this election: polling.
Surveys badly missed the results, predicting an easy win for former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic pickup in the Senate, and gains for the party in the House. Instead, the presidential election is still too close to call, Republicans seem poised to hold the Senate, and the Democratic edge in the House is likely to shrink.
This is a disaster for the polling industry and for media outlets and analysts that..."
"The price of everything that goes into producing crops is surging, threatening to further fan global food inflation. 
Food production costs were already high. The pandemic snarled supply chains, making it more difficult — and expensive — to get parts and supplies that are vital for growing crops. Then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine took things to another level, sending markets soaring for fertilizers and for the fuels needed to run farm machinery. Inflation is so rampant that even with rising food prices, farmers are facing increasingly tough margins.
That’s the problem for Eddie Smith,..."
"In Rob Reiner’s 1987 cult comedy, The Princess Bride, Fezzik asks the mysterious man in black a question as they scuffle atop the Cliffs of Insanity: “Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid or something like that?” “Oh no,” replies the masked stranger, secretly a humble stable boy. “It’s just that they’re terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.”
This quote, from one of the world’s most quotable movies, got passed around a lot last spring, in the early days of the coronavirus..."
"Since launching his presidential candidacy 14 months ago, Donald Trump's most consistent and uncompromising policy issue has been immigration. Indeed, it was the subject of his first general-election TV ad that started airing on Friday. Yet over the weekend, his top aides and advisers suggested that Trump might be shifting on his past position that all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States must be deported forcibly."
"Is Donald Trump considering wavering on a key campaign promise?
That's what several news reports published over the weekend suggest. And while the Trump campaign issued a statement denying any shift on immigration policy, top surrogates and campaign operatives hinted that a change just might be on its way."
"The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has surpassed 100,000 — with California recording at least 60 — as officials worked to contain the virus despite the rapid spread.
World Health Organization officials pressed countries Friday to aggressively pursue containment and expand testing for COVID-19 as the outbreak swells."
"Many women are left feeling defeated after Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the presidential race.
With a crushing loss on Super Tuesday, and voter after voter quoted in the media saying they’d vote for a woman, just not Warren, it made some wonder if a woman would be president in their lifetimes. Warren spoke about the bind women candidates face while talking with reporters Thursday afternoon."
"Congressional negotiators announced Tuesday that they'd reached a budget proposal to restore about $65 billion worth of sequestration cuts in exchange for cuts elsewhere and additional fees.
If approved by both the House and Senate, the plan — hammered out by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington — would avoid another government shutdown on Jan. 15."
"The internet was flooded with false claims about voter fraud in the days following the 2020 U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, 2020. Many of these rumors centered around a piece of software from Dominion Voting Systems. We’ve addressed a few of these rumors in a previous article, but the most prevalent claim, and one that was spread by U.S. President Donald Trump himself on Nov. 12, 2020, was that Dominion software had deleted 2.7 million votes that had been cast for the incumbent.
There is no truth to this..."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., revealed on Monday night that she is a sexual assault survivor while recounting her experiences during last month's insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
""I'm a survivor of sexual assault,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, her voice quivering with emotion. ""And I haven't told many people that in my life. But when we go through trauma, trauma compounds on each other.""
In a 90-minute video live-streamed on Instagram that has since garnered over 1 million views, the 31-year-old congresswoman recalled fearing for her life as she and others were forced..."
"The Jussie Smollett saga may now be technically over after a Chicago jury found the actor guilty Thursday of five of the six counts he faced, but its impact will be — and has already been — felt for years to come. It doesn’t matter if the actor, who starred on “Empire,” really was beaten up by people yelling “This is MAGA country!” and is wrongly being punished or if he did stage an elaborate hoax, as the jury decided he did by finding him guilty of five counts of disorderly..."
"As President-elect Joe Biden reveals his economic team, one nominee already is facing stiff resistance from Senate Republicans, leading Democrats to rally in her defense ahead of what could prove to be a rough and tumble confirmation process.
Neera Tanden, Biden’s choice to become director of the Office of Management and Budget, is celebrated by the president-elect’s team for her career pursuing policies in support of working families and what they call ""broad-based"" economic growth."
"The New York Times ran a story this week suggesting that the economic recovery is slowing and, in certain industries in certain parts of the country, even reversing. This makes sense given the resurgence of coronavirus cases in places like Texas and Florida and the more-cautious reopening measures being taken in other, less affected areas worried that a spike might be just around the corner. On Wednesday, New York City announced it would indefinitely postpone the resumption of indoor dining service, as New Jersey did a few days prior. California..."
"The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has accused environmental groups of setting fires in the Amazon as he tries to deflect growing international criticism of his failure to protect the world’s biggest rainforest.
A surge of fires in several Amazonian states this month followed reports that farmers were feeling emboldened to clear land for crop fields and cattle ranches because the new Brazilian government was keen to open up the region to economic activity."
"Russian police in riot gear detained more than 1,000 protesters Saturday at a demonstration against the exclusion of opposition politicians from the ballot for an upcoming city council election, a monitoring group said, marking another flare of anti-government defiance a week after Moscow’s largest opposition rally in years.
Police said around 3,500 people gathered near City Hall for the unauthorized protest organized by prominent opposition figure Alexei Navalny. Earlier this week, a Russian court sentenced Navalny to 30 days in jail for calling for the demonstration. A handful of other..."
"Nearly 1,400 people were detained in a violent police crackdown on an opposition protest in Moscow, a Russian group that monitors police arrests said Sunday, adding that was the largest number of detentions at a rally in the Russian capital this decade.
OVD-Info, which has monitored the arrests since 2011, said the number of the detentions it logged for Saturday’s protest reached 1,373 by early Sunday. The overwhelming majority of people were soon released but 150 remain in custody, OVD-Info and a lawyers’ association providing legal aid to the detainees..."
"The most exhaustive report yet on the May 24 mass shooting inside a Uvalde, Tex., elementary school spread blame across every law enforcement agency responding to the attack, faulting local police for mistakes and more experienced agencies for failing to take charge.
Nearly 400 local, state and federal law enforcement officers were at the scene that day, including 91 state troopers — none of whom took the initiative to lead the response, the Texas House investigative report said. The school district police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, wrote its active shooter..."
"One year after the smoke and broken glass, the mock gallows and the very real bloodshed of that awful day, it is tempting to look back and imagine that we can, in fact, simply look back. To imagine that what happened on Jan. 6, 2021 — a deadly riot at the seat of American government, incited by a defeated president amid a last-ditch effort to thwart the transfer of power to his successor — was horrifying but that it is in the past and that we as a nation have moved on...."
"The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily blocked same-sex marriage in Utah, an apparently unanimous order in favor of the state that sends the matter back to an appeals court for expedited consideration.
The case could have sweeping national implications, depending on how the federal appeals panel rules on a challenge to the state's same-sex marriage ban and whether the case returns to the high court.
Utah asked the Supreme Court to intervene last week after 10th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to stay a lower court ruling in December striking..."
"Two gay New York businessmen who hosted a recent dinner for Ted Cruz apologized to the gay community, saying it was a “terrible mistake” because of the GOP presidential hopeful’s opposition to same-sex marriage.
Ian Reisner, in a Facebook message posted Sunday night, said he has been upset by the backlash he’s received from gay men and lesbians, who called for a boycott of The Out NYC hotel and Fire Islands Pines businesses run by Reisner and his business partner, Mati Weiderpass"
"Ian Reisner, a gay businessman who hosted an event for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in New York this week, apologized on Sunday after furious backlash from the gay community.
Reisner and his longtime partner Mati Weiderpass hosted a ""fireside chat"" with the presidential candidate, who reportedly softened his notoriously anti-gay tone at the event by claiming that, if one of his daughters were gay, ""I would love them just as much.” News of Cruz's appearance prompted a boycott of the two men's businesses.
In a statement posted to his Facebook..."
"Court filings have revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has even broader authority than the already extensive power granted by Rod Rosenstein to investigate the Trump campaign “and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” In an August 2, 2017 memo, Rosenstein gave the special counsel authority to investigate Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for his efforts in the Ukraine, and his ongoing outreach to Russia."
"Top negotiators on a bipartisan gun safety framework deal huddled behind closed doors for several hours Wednesday evening to try to solve remaining differences, but the group's effort to expedite passage of an agreement is stalled, at least for the moment.
Since a group of 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans announced an agreement Sunday on a framework of proposals aimed at curbing gun violence in the wake of mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, a bipartisan group of senators has been working to speedily turn the list..."
"Republicans are claiming outrage after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) compared immigration detention centers along the southern border to concentration camps—remarks she first made during an Instagram Live session late Monday and has since defended.
“That is exactly what they are: They are concentration camps,” Ocasio-Cortez told her followers on Monday. “I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that ‘never again’ means something.”"
"At least three armed militants have stormed a luxury hotel in Pakistan and exchanged fire with government forces.
Local media said the fighters stormed the Pearl Continental hotel in Gwadar just before 5pm local time on Saturday. Firing was still ongoing at 8pm, the assistant superintendent of police in the city said. Security personnel cordoned off the area around the hotel.
A spokesman for Pakistan’s military said a hotel security guard had been killed.
The attack was claimed on Twitter by members of the Majeed Brigade of the Balochistan Liberation..."
"The United States will expand its sanctions on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, targeting members of the country’s parliament and the central bank’s gold reserves, the White House announced Thursday.
At the same time, Washington will increase its humanitarian assistance by welcoming 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and providing an additional $1 billion in food, medicine, water and other supplies.
The White House announced the initiatives as U.S. President Joe Biden and world leaders gathered in Brussels for a trio of summits in response to the Russian invasion, seeking..."
"CNN has “indefinitely” suspended anchor Chris Cuomo after new documents emerged this week detailing assistance he provided to his older brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, amid the sexual harassment allegations that eventually led to the governor’s resignation.
“The New York Attorney General’s office released transcripts and exhibits Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo’s involvements in his brother’s defense,” a CNN spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday evening. “The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions.”
The documents and transcripts,..."
"A fiercely divided House tossed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off both her committees Thursday, an unprecedented punishment that Democrats said she’d earned by spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories.
Underscoring the political vise her inflammatory commentary has clamped her party into, nearly all Republicans voted against the Democratic move but none defended her lengthy history of outrageous social media posts."
"The Democratic-led House Thursday voted mostly along party lines to remove Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her two committees following a charged floor debate rife with finger-pointing and threats of repercussions.
The vote was 230-199 with 11 Republicans joining every Democrat in stripping her from the Education & Labor Committee and the Budget Committee for a litany of incendiary, conspiratorial and menacing social media posts before she was elected.
The floor debate in a chamber already riven by division and mistrust turned raw as lawmakers took turns arguing..."
"Thanks to the 1st Amendment, government in the United States has little power to stop people from speaking their minds. But the Bill of Rights doesn’t constrain Facebook, Twitter and other Big Tech companies, which decided in the wake of last week’s attack on the U.S. Capitol that the world has heard enough from President Trump.
On one level, it’s understandable that private companies would not want their services and platforms used to foment violence and undermine democracy. On another, their actions show just how much power over global speech..."
"At the beginning of this year’s midterm campaign, analysts and political operatives had every reason to expect a strong Republican showing this November. President Biden’s approval rating was in the low 40s, and the president’s party has a long history of struggling in midterm elections.
But as the start of the general election campaign nears, it’s becoming increasingly hard to find any concrete signs of Republican strength.
Tuesday’s strong Democratic showing in a special congressional election in New York’s 19th District is only the latest example. On paper, this classic..."
"Rep. Jerrold Nadler trounced Rep. Carolyn Maloney in their blockbuster Manhattan primary Tuesday, holding on to the district he has represented for three decades and ousting a fellow Democratic congressional titan after an unusually contentious campaign.
With nearly all ballots tallied, Nadler held about 56% of the vote total compared to the 24% clinched by Maloney, according to state Board of Elections returns from the 12th Congressional District primary. Insurgent candidate Suraj Patel trailed them with about 19%.
U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler speaks during his election night victory party in..."
"AWhite House official tried to quash a story about his relationship with a reporter by issuing threats and using derogatory language to another reporter pursuing it, according to two sources familiar with the incident. In a sympathetic profile Monday, People revealed that White House Deputy Press Secretary TJ Ducklo is dating Axios political reporter Alexi McCammond, who covered the Joe Biden campaign. But behind the scenes, Ducklo had previously lashed out at Politico reporter Tara Palmeri, who was reporting the story, exhibiting behavior that led to tense meetings between the..."
"The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday a gain of 170,000 seasonally adjusted new private-sector jobs in July, but there was a loss of 13,000 public sector jobs, bringing the total gain to 157,000. That was far below the 190,000 gain that the consensus of experts expected. The headline unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent. July’s gains marked the 94th consecutive month of overall job growth."
"Senate Democrats are expected to punt consideration of the cornerstone element of President Joe Biden's agenda into next year after private conversations between Biden and the key Democratic holdout made clear the bill would not have the votes to pass this month.
Critical talks between Biden and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, the Senate's most important swing vote, over how to pass a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package remain far from any resolution on a series of issues, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the discussions.
The impasse, even as talks..."
"President Biden, heeding widespread calls to step up his response to the pandemic’s surge abroad, said on Monday that his administration would send 20 million doses of federally authorized coronavirus vaccine overseas in June — the first time he has pledged to give away doses that could be used in the United States.
The donation is another step toward what Mr. Biden promised would be an “entirely new effort” to increase vaccine supplies and vastly expand manufacturing capacity, most of it in the United States. He also put Jeffrey Zients,..."
"President Biden on Monday announced his intention to ship surplus doses of the coronavirus vaccine to needy nations abroad, including millions of doses of the U.S.-authorized Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The majority of the planned shipments will be of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which does not yet have authorization for use in the United States.
""We need to help fight the disease around the world,"" Biden told reporters at a briefing on the nation's progress against the virus. ""It's the right thing to do, it's the smart thing..."
"CBS has fired a former ABC News employee after receiving word they were the person who leaked a video of anchor Amy Robach venting about a scrapped story about Jeffrey Epstein.
Journalist Yashar Ali was the first to report the news that ABC had discovered the source of the leak, writing “ABC News executives know who the former employee is but don’t know if that person leaked the footage to Project Veritas, the right-wing activist group, or if they shared it with others who leaked the footage” and that the..."
"Joe Biden has been accused of sexual assault, and conservatives are having a field day, exultant that they’ve caught feminists in a new hypocrisy trap. A woman, with no corroboration beyond contemporaneous accounts, charges a powerful man with a decades-old crime? Hmm, doesn’t that sound mighty close to Christine Blasey Ford’s complaint against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh? Yet this time, many liberals who’ve championed the #MeToo movement seem skeptical?
Gotcha!
Tim Graham, executive editor of NewsBusters: “Where is the #MeToo movement on this story? What happened to their rigid..."
"In early October 2018, amidst the hysteria surrounding the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, I wrote an opinion piece for USA TODAY questioning the wisdom of the “believe all women” rhetoric that many cited in condemning Justice Kavanaugh, without any critical analysis of the allegation against him.
Less than two years later, the biggest proponents of this movement at the time of the Kavanaugh hearing seem to be backtracking on its logic."
"Yesterday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp issued an Executive Order striking down mask requirements in at least fifteen local jurisdictions.
While the governor has encouraged Georgians to mask up to prevent the spread of coronavirus, he has called mandates “a bridge too far.” So despite growing evidence that masks work, and Kemp’s own exhortation that people should mask up if they want to watch college football this fall, the newest order explicitly makes them optional.
The ordinance also caps indoor gatherings at fifty persons and suspends the requirement that Georgians renew..."
"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is overruling local government mandates requiring people to wear masks in public to stop the spread of COVID-19, insisting that the state's less-stringent guidelines take precedence.
Kemp on Wednesday extended the state's COVID-19 restrictions, which strongly encourage the wearing of masks, but stopped short of requiring them in public, calling such a measure ""a bridge too far.""
His order explicitly rescinds mask orders in such key cities as Atlanta, Savannah, Athens and Augusta, along with more than a dozen other local jurisdictions where similar directives have..."
"The U.S. House of Representatives agreed on at least one issue as the government shutdown entered its fifth day Saturday: Federal employees will receive back pay for the time they were out of work.
The Federal Employee Retroactive Pay Fairness Act sailed through the lower chamber by a vote of 407-0 Saturday morning. The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Virginia Reps. Jim Moran (D) and Frank Wolf (R), was expected to pass, since Congress has typically granted back pay to furloughed workers after previous government shutdowns."
"A bill that provides back pay for furloughed Federal workers during the government shutdown unanimously passed the House during a rare Saturday session on Capitol Hill.
Some 800,000 federal workers have been stuck at home without pay since October 1 when Congress failed to pass a budget for the new fiscal year.
On Friday, the White House said the president would sign the measure."
"How will Donald Trump pick his new Supreme Court nominee? It’s Donald Trump, so the answer is obviously personal chemistry (no doubt with a heavy dose of how loyal he thinks they’ll be) plus optics. Trump is starting out with a pre-approved list of far-right judges and legal thinkers courtesy of the Federalist Society, so from there he can go with his gut, knowing that the right-wing legal and political establishments will nod along approvingly."
"A gunman opened fire at a church in Texas on Sunday morning, killing two people with a shotgun before a member of the church’s volunteer security team fatally shot him, the authorities said.
About 250 people were inside the auditorium of the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, near Fort Worth, when the gunman began shooting just before communion, said Jack Cummings, a minister at the church.
Mr. Cummings said the gunman was “acting suspiciously” before the shooting and drew the attention of the church’s security team. The..."
"A man pulled out a shotgun inside a North Texas church on Sunday and opened fire, killing two people, authorities said. It could have been far worse.
Two congregants, both volunteer members of the church's security team, drew their weapons and confronted the gunman, fatally shooting him and saving an ""untold number of lives"" at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town of about 17,000 people near Fort Worth.
Their actions, described as ""heroic"" by the Texas Department of Public Safety, brought a quick end to an..."
"President Obama is preparing to nominate Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio as his new secretary of housing and urban development, elevating one of his party’s Hispanic rising stars as part of a cabinet shuffle that has possible implications for the 2016 presidential race, Democrats informed about the plans said on Saturday.
Mr. Castro, who has often been mentioned as a potential vice-presidential candidate for the Democrats, would take the pl"
"Its official: 2012 was the warmest year on record in the lower 48 states, as the country experienced blistering spring and summer heat, tinderbox fire weather conditions amid a widespread drought, and one of the worst storms to ever strike the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2012 had an average temperature of 55.3Ã‚Â°F, which eclipsed 1998, the previous record holder, by 1Ã‚Â°F. That was just off Climate Centrals calculation in mid-December, which projected an expected value of 55.34Ã‚Â°F, based on historical data."
"As the United States reopens its international borders Monday to travelers from 33 countries who have proof of vaccination and a recent negative coronavirus test, airlines are bracing for an “onslaught” of passengers as families and binational couples prepare to reunite following months of separation.
For many around the world — and the struggling American travel and tourism industries — this day has been a long time coming. It also follows grim milestones that serve as a reminder that the pandemic is not over: More than 5 million people have died globally, and 250 million coronavirus cases have..."
"Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Thursday sought to clarify his argument that “it is absolutely the government’s business” to know which Americans have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, after facing backlash from Republicans in Congress.
In a tweet, the federal government’s top health official said his comments from earlier in the day had been “taken wildly out of context.”"
"Donald Trump's unique second impeachment sealed history's verdict on a corrupt and disgraced presidency. But the political endgame of this tragic saga is only now beginning and will decide the extent of America's recovery from his malevolent term.
The soon-to-be ex-President's Senate impeachment trial will mean his toxic presence will pollute the opening of Joe Biden's presidency. It will also seriously complicate his successor's quest to leverage the apex of his power in his early days in office to get a grip on a murderous panic that's never been worse...."
"Establishment politicians running for high office live and breathe elaborate focus group-tested lines. In time, they become those lines. But every now and then, extreme political pressures can force a few unscripted words to slip through. And when that happens, we gain a rare glimpse of the candidate’s deeper understanding of their world and our world — and the incredible gap between the two."
"President Barack Obama expressed concern Thursday about the “violent turn” in Ferguson, Mo., saying “now is the time for healing” following days of protests after a fatal police shooting.
“Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,” Obama said from Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing. “Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.”"
"President Obama said Thursday that “now is the time for healing” after a series of clashes between protesters and police over the shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., but he also called for an open and transparent investigation “to see that justice is done” in the case.
Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., where he is on vacation, Obama said that many Americans “have been deeply disturbed” by images of violence in the St. Louis suburb following the police shooting Saturday afternoon of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old African..."
"For each of the three nights of prosecutors’ opening arguments, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered emotional finales to the day’s impeachment testimony that received high praise from Democrats and even from some of President Trump’s closest GOP allies.
But when Trump’s legal defense team took over Saturday morning, Schiff went from lauded orator to the top target of the effort to undercut the House managers’ case against the president. The president’s lawyers bookended their two-hour presentation with attacks on Schiff’s character and credibility.
Democrats were delighted when Schiff’s passionate..."
"A small group of left-leaning congresspeople appear to be more willing than ever to drift away from the political center, though one of them shouldn't come as much of a surprise. According to multiple reports, Sen. Bernie Sanders' new job plan would guarantee employment for every American who is willing and able to work. It might sound like a big promise to make, but he suggests the government would be smart to back it. And he's not the only one saying so."
"The separation of church and state survived a close brush with death on Thursday, emerging scathed but alive thanks to a compromise decision that may not hold for long. Seven justices voted to allow a 94-year-old, 40-foot cross to remain on public land and those managing the cross to continue receiving state funding. But that lopsided vote conceals deep fractures among the justices over the government’s authority to honor and promote religion. The majority opinion portends more radical decisions to come while doing real damage to the establishment clause today,..."
"Just how effective President-elect Joe Biden will be in getting his policies enacted by Congress rests largely on the outcome of the Senate runoff races in Georgia.
Georgia’s two Republican U.S. senators — David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler — are seeking to keep their seats and preserve the Republicans’ majority in the Senate. Democrats control the U.S. House by a narrow margin.
Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff is seeking to oust Perdue, while the Rev. Raphael Warnock is vying for Loeffler’s seat. (The winner of the Loeffler-Warnock race will serve the..."

The billionaire couple sets the strategic vision for the $50 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which they co-founded and which spends more than $5 billion a year on causes like US education and worldwide disease eradication. Their divorce potentially has enormous implications for their work.

"While it’s been nearly two weeks since the infamous Will Smith/Chris Rock slap incident occurred at the 2022 Oscars, the Academy has finally handed down its reprimands for the King Richard star.
After a nearly three-hour long Board of Governors meeting on Friday, per an official “Open Letter to Our Academy Family” from Academy President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson sent to The Root, the Academy has decided to officially ban Smith from attending “any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards” in addition to accepting his resignation from the prestigious membership."
"Elon Musk will actually buy Twitter — for real this time — at $54.20 a share. Musk confirmed the offer in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the SEC filing, he says he will “proceed to closing of the transaction” on the terms he negotiated with Twitter in April, as long as the lawsuit Twitter brought against him to force him to close the deal is adjourned.
The filing follows reporting from Bloomberg that suggested Musk would close the deal under the original terms he proposed in April before trying to back..."
"A pair of missiles hit an Iran-flagged oil tanker steaming off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Red Sea, causing an explosion and oil spill, Iranian officials said Friday.
Iran's state-run IRNA identified the tanker as the Sabiti, and Iranian state television says the explosions damaged two storage tanks and caused an oil spill that is now reportedly under control.
The Iranian media reports did not assign responsibility for the incident.

"Donald J. Trump has been roiling Republicans by attacking his rivals on their weak poll numbers and questioning their energy (Jeb Bush) and intelligence (Rick Perry).
But the larger threat that he poses to the party is the prospect that he could opt out and run as a third-party candidate. True to form, Mr. Trump is keeping the option open.
In an interview with The Hill newspaper published on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that many of his supporters have been urging him to consider a third-party run if he fails..."
"Tens of thousands of environmental activists are flooding New York City’s streets this weekend in a coming-out party for a new breed of environmentalism – one that’s louder and rowdier than the old-school greens who dominated the movement when Barack Obama entered the White House.
These upstarts like 350.org are brushing aside the staid Washington lobbying strategies of groups that failed to pass a climate bill in 2010. Instead they’re getting arrested outside the White House gates, staging costumed protests around the president’s travels and planning to clog Wall..."
"On Tuesday, world leaders will converge at United Nations headquarters in New York for a summit meeting on the climate that will set the stage for global negotiations next year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the threat of global climate change.

"The Trump Organization on Thursday accused the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office of using the company’s chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg as a “pawn” in a political crusade against former President Donald Trump, while avoiding any specific denials of wrongdoing by the newly indicted top executive.
The statement from the Trump Organization came shortly after Weisselberg surrendered to authorities early Thursday morning ahead of expected charges against him and the former president’s family business, according to multiple news outlets.
The Trump Organization described Weisselberg as “a loving and devoted husband, father..."
"For more than 100 years, two statues representing Virginia have stood at the U.S. Capitol: one of George Washington and another of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
But early Monday, the Lee statue was removed from the National Statuary Hall's collection. It's expected to be replaced by a statue honoring civil rights activist Barbara Johns.
""This is a historic and long-overdue moment for our Commonwealth,"" U.S. Reps. Donald McEachin and Jennifer Wexton, both Democrats from Virginia, said in a statement. ""The Robert E. Lee statue honors a legacy of division,..."
"The statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee inside the U.S. Capitol was removed from the building’s crypt Monday morning and will be relocated to the Virginia Museum of History & Culture.
The removal was conducted by staff from the Architect of the Capitol and attended by members of Virginia’s congressional delegation including Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), and a representative from the office of Rep. Donald McEachin (D-Va.).
A commission established earlier this year by the Virginia General Assembly recommended last week that a statue of..."
"Impeachment is getting up close and personal.
The House Intelligence Committee will hold its first public impeachment hearings next week, committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced Wednesday. Former top Ukraine diplomat William Taylor and current Europe adviser George Kent will testify Wednesday, Nov. 13, and ex-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will testify Friday, Nov. 15."
"(CNN)House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff on Wednesday announced impeachment hearings will begin next week as Democrats prepare to take their case against President Donald Trump to the public.

"Democratic US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has apologised for – but has not left – an elite private beach club that refuses to accept anyone who is not white.
GoLocal Providence, a local publication in Providence, Rhode Island, confronted Mr Whitehouse in 2017 about his membership at Bailey's Beach Club in Newport, which does not allow minorities into its ranks and is considered to be one of the most exclusive clubs in the US.

"The ringleader behind a $25 million college admission scam that implicated dozens of people, including Hollywood actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, said he has worked with more than 750 families.
William Rick Singer, who pleaded guilty Tuesday in a Boston federal court to racketeering, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges, said in a phone conversation recorded by the FBI that he helps ""the wealthiest families in the U.S. get their kids into school.""

"Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Monday morning that she was not making a specific allegation when she answered a reporter’s question over the weekend about President Donald Trump’s wiretapping claims by remarking that “you can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets — any number of ways.”"
"Americans are generally skeptical of too much government intervention. Over the past three decades, the number of people saying they want the government to do less usually outnumbers those saying they want it to do more, according to Gallup.
The times when that hasn't been true or when that gap has shrunk have roughly coincided with times of national crisis. However, over the past several years, those saying government should do more to solve the country's problems has crept up to almost being on par with those saying government is..."
"The state has been in retreat since the 80s heyday of Reagan and Thatcher but that could change as coronavirus delivers a shock to the system of historic proportions
Ronald Reagan’s 1986 wisecrack – “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government and I’m here to help” – would not get a lot of laughs today. In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.
Reagan’s attitude to government solidified..."
"CHINA AND THE WORLD Health Organization could have responded quicker and more definitively to contain the coronavirus pandemic at its outset, an independent review panel determined.
In its second interim report published Monday, the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, an impartial body established by WHO, determined that China could have been more forceful in implementing public health measures when COVID-19 cases were first discovered in Wuhan.
""What is clear to the panel is that public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health..."
"A panel of experts commissioned by the World Health Organization has criticized China and other countries for not moving to stem the initial outbreak of the coronavirus earlier and questioned whether the U.N. health agency should have labeled it a pandemic sooner.
In a report issued to the media Monday, the panel led by former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said there were “lost opportunities” to adopt basic public health measures as early as possible.
“What is clear to the panel is..."
"After Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, they introduced and passed the For the People Act as H.R. 1 — the first bill of their majority. It aimed to restore voting rights, reform campaign finance laws and enhance ethics enforcement. Senate Democrats have now done the same after reclaiming the chamber majority with the introduction of S. 1, their version of the For the People Act.
These nearly identical bills contain a suite of policies to protect, enhance and expand democracy, according to..."
Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday. These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.
"One of the biggest threats to the recovery of the Democratic Party these days is overreach. Having seen what Republicans have accomplished while pushing to the right, Democrats are debating how hard to push in the opposite direction — on the minimum wage, on abortion, on health care and on education. A party that was once afraid of being tagged with supporting “government-run” health care is increasingly okay with the word “liberal” and even voted in droves for a self-described socialist in 2016. And its 2020 hopefuls are leading the..."
"Hillary Clinton recaptured momentum with her win against Bernie Sanders in the Nevada caucuses last weekend, but the South Carolina primary on Saturday will serve as the true test of whether she can excite the voters who shunned her in 2008 to support Barack Obama.
In her last campaign, the state shattered Mrs. Clinton’s hopes and frayed the relationship she and Bill Clinton had with black voters, dealing Mr. Obama a 28-percentage-point victory and convincing the country that his appeal extended beyond the largely white, liberal electorate of Iowa."
"More than a week after streets in Baltimore erupted in violence, President Barack Obama attempted on Tuesday to pinpoint the roots of the unrest there, which he says include a lack of opportunity for inner-city youth and laws that make it difficult to escape a cycle of crime.
Joining prominent policy experts to discuss the roots and potential solutions to poverty, Obama identified what he said was a troubling trend toward social stratification that separates the well-off from the poor.
""What used to be racial segregation now mirrors itself in..."
"During two campaigns and most of his time in office, President Obama has portrayed himself as the champion of a middle class fighting to recover from a devastating economic collapse.
But eruptions of racial tensions in Baltimore; Ferguson, Mo.; and Staten Island have accelerated a shift in the later stages of Mr. Obama’s presidency, as the nation’s first black president begins to refocus his administration’s attention on the plight of the poor, especially in African-American communities.
On Tuesday, the president extended that effort by participating in a panel discussion at..."
"With fighting intensifying in eastern Ukraine and the White House weighing whether to send arms to bolster the government’s forces, Western leaders embarked on a broad diplomatic effort on Thursday aimed at ending a conflict that has strained relations with Russia.
Yet, the prospects of achieving a new peace plan remained clouded by deep suspicions of Moscow, born of its history of dissembling about its intentions and operations in Ukraine, Western diplomats and Ukrainian officials said."
"Britain’s National Health Service delivered its first shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, opening a mass vaccination campaign with little precedent in modern medicine and making Britons the first people in the world to receive a clinically authorized, fully tested vaccine.
At 6:31 a.m. Tuesday, Margaret Keenan, 90, a former jewelry shop assistant, rolled up the sleeve of her “Merry Christmas” T-shirt to receive the first shot, and her image quickly became an emblem of the remarkable race to produce a vaccine and the global effort to end..."
"Marco Rubio has lost his last primary. On Tuesday night, the Florida senator watched as Donald Trump was immediately declared the victor in his home state's Republican contest -- the race Rubio could not lose if he wanted to continue. The result will almost certainly touch off a despairing round of hand-wringing from the GOP establishment set, but in all likelihood, his Sunshine State defeat will not generate any surprise from the political press."
"Three days before Florida’s climactic primary, Marco Rubio sank deep into a black leather armchair on his campaign bus. He had just spent 25 minutes smiling wide for supporters at a high-end boutique selling $150 candles. “Don’t forget to vote on Tuesday!” he shouted from the third step of a wood-paneled staircase. Now, on his parked bus, the afternoon sunlight shut out by drawn blinds, the smile was gone. The candidate knew it was already over."
"In a high-stakes video call, President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping spoke Friday morning for the first time since November amid concerns that China will help Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
The White House said the two leaders spoke for one hour and 50 minutes.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would be candid and direct and that the call provided a chance for him to ""assess where President Xi stands."" The conversation would center on ""managing the competition between our two countries as..."
"Democrats rebelled against the government funding bill Thursday, joining with a handful of Republicans to nearly vote down a measure that would keep federal offices running, but was also packed with policy riders walking back financial reform.

"North Korea has built a new structure at a military site where it produces long-range missiles, a worrying sign that the isolated nation is preparing the ""Christmas gift"" it warned the U.S. about: a long-range missile test.
Planets Labs released satellite imagery showing the new structure at the March 16 Factory near Pyongyang, a site North Korea reportedly uses to build mobile launchers for its long-range missiles, according to the AP."
"North Korea doesn't really do Christmas cards, but if it did, its card would probably have a picture of the nation's leader, Kim Jong Un, riding a white horse through a snowy wilderness. In fact, North Korean state media released those exact images this month, and the message was clear: Kim, frustrated with how things were going, was pondering a new direction.

The Texas Republican thanked Trump on Twitter following the president's earlier announcement, also on Twitter, that Ratcliffe was his nominee to replace outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.
Coats and Trump haven't been sympatico from the beginning and the White House has been telling journalists for weeks that the president wanted somebody else.

"Sen. Chris Murphy on Monday dismissed Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), President Donald Trump’s nominee to become the next director of national intelligence, as a “television character” who is an “inappropriate choice” for the historically nonpartisan post.
“I don't know this guy,” Murphy (D-Conn.) said on MSNBC. “I think he's a television character that the president has watched on TV, and he wants to put somebody in this position who's going to agree with his political take on intelligence.”"

"Sen. Josh Hawley on Wednesday pledged to challenge President-elect Joe Biden's victory in Pennsylvania and possibly other states on Jan. 6, when Congress is set to certify the results of the 2020 election.
The Missouri Republican's announcement guarantees that both chambers will be forced to debate the results of at least one state and vote on whether to accept Biden's victory, a process that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had urged Republicans to avoid, despite pressure from President Donald Trump, who is urging Republicans to overturn the democratic results."
"Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Friday made public the names of nearly 102,000 people who are at risk of having their Georgia voter registrations canceled, a warning before they lose their ability to vote next month.
The mass cancellations, called voter “purges” by their critics, target registered voters who moved or didn’t participate in elections for several years.
Fewer voter registrations are being canceled this year than in 2017, when 534,000 were eliminated from Georgia’s voter rolls during the largest removal of registrations in U.S. history. Most of the state’s outdated registrations..."

Documents obtained by The New York Times show that Mr. Biden’s first budget request as president calls for the federal government to spend $6 trillion..."
"President Joe Biden on Friday touted the bipartisan infrastructure package that he signed into law in November, while also addressing the dramatic bridge collapse in Pittsburgh that occurred just hours before he arrived in the city.
Fern Hollow Bridge near Frick Park, the site of the collapse, had been rated in ""poor condition"" for the last 10 years, Biden said. Across the country, 45,000 bridges are in poor condition, a number Biden called ""unacceptable."""

"By 10 am, Speaker Nancy Pelosi had both unveiled two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and announced that Democrats had reached an agreement with the president on a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Democrats were somber in announcing the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against the president. But the mood was almost jubilant an hour later when Pelosi praised the White House-led United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which she said Democrats take ""great pride in."" Democrats touted their efforts in securing various..."
"Democrats handed President Donald Trump a political win Tuesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that Democrats have reached a deal with the administration on the new North American trade agreement.
The deal coincides with House Democrats unveiling two articles of impeachment against the president, and edges Trump closer to victory on a signature 2016 campaign promise with the trade deal.

Trump applauded the progress on the agreement, saying it would be ""the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA"" and predicted..."
"Fair or unfair, Democrats' chief criticism of Hillary Clinton has been that she doesn't truly share their most cherished values, particularly when it comes to addressing inequality. They also worry that she's not ready for prime time — that she's too stilted, too programmed, too cold on the stump.
On Wednesday she answered both points.
Her first major policy address of the 2016 campaign was Clinton at her finest, showcasing both strong policy chops and a deep sensitivity to Americans who are heartbroken over the deaths of young black men..."
"With the fires out and much of the glass cleaned up in Baltimore, the ""soul searching"" as President Obama called it, has begun. For those hoping to become the next president of the United States, weighing in presents both an opportunity and a challenge.

"Donald Trump, in his telling, could have shot somebody on Fifth Avenue and won. Boris Johnson could mislead the queen. He could break his promise to get Britain out of Europe by Oct. 31. He could lie about Turks invading Britain and the cost of European Union membership. He could make up stories about building 40 new hospitals. He could double down on the phantom $460 million a week that Brexit would deliver to the National Health Service — and still win a landslide Tory electoral victory not seen since..."

"Around this time every year, Joseph Bankman, a professor of tax law at Stanford Law School and a longtime advocate of using technology to simplify tax filing, gets on the phone with reporters to explain what is wrong with how we do our taxes in the United States.

"The number of migrant arrivals along the U.S. southern border soared in March to the highest levels since 2000, surpassing 200,000 for only the third time during the Biden administration, according to government statistics submitted to a federal court Friday.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported processing migrants 221,303 times along the Mexican border last month, which overtook the previous peak under the Biden administration in July 2021, when U.S. officials recorded 213,593 migrant encounters, agency figures show.
Nearly 210,000 of the migrant encounters last month were recorded by Border Patrol, which arrests migrants..."
"A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday endorsed a Montana tax incentive program that indirectly helps private religious schools, a major victory for those who want to see more public funding of religious institutions.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for a conservative majority in the 5 to 4 ruling, said the Montana Supreme Court was wrong to strike down the program because of a provision in the state constitution that forbids public funds from going to religious institutions. The U.S. Constitution’s protection of religious freedom prevails, he said.

Didn't happen. But while we're on the subject, ever wonder why we carve our gobblers on the fourth Thursday of November? Hint: It's not because Thanksgiving Thursday is more alliterative than Thanksgiving Friday.
In 1789, President George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. 26, as a ""Day of Publick Thanksgivin,"" according to the National Archives. But in the years following, the date for the holiday was announced by presidential proclamation and was celebrated on various days and in..."
"When I was a child, Thanksgiving was simple. It was about turkey and dressing, love and laughter, a time for the family to gather around a feast and be thankful for the year that had passed and be hopeful for the year to come.
In school, the story we learned was simple, too: Pilgrims and Native Americans came together to give thanks.
We made pictures of the gathering, everyone smiling. We colored turkeys or made them out of construction paper. We sometimes had a mini-feast in class.
I thought it..."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu headed to Washington on Sunday to press his case against an emerging deal on Iran's nuclear program in a contentious address to the U.S. Congress, which he said he is delivering out of concern for Israel's security.
The address has caused an uproar that has exposed tensions between Israel and its most important ally, the United States. In accepting a Republican invitation to address Congress, Netanyahu angered the White House, which was not consulted with in advance of the invite, as well as Democrats who..."
"The report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III lays out in alarming detail abundant evidence against President Trump, finding 10 “episodes” of potential obstruction of justice but ultimately concluding it was not Mueller’s role to determine whether the commander in chief broke the law.
Submitted to Congress on Thursday, the 448-page document alternates between jarring scenes of presidential scheming and dense legal analysis, and it marks the onset of a new phase of the Trump administration in which congressional Democrats must decide what, if anything, to do with Mueller’s..."
"A Boston-area hospital said it will not perform a heart transplant on a patient who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccination.
DJ Ferguson, 31, was previously prioritized for a heart transplant at Brigham and Women’s hospital, but is no longer eligible as he refuses to get vaccinated, said Ferguson’s family, according to a report by CBS Boston.
“It’s kind of against his basic principles – he doesn’t believe in it,” said David Ferguson, his father. “It’s a policy they are enforcing and so, because he won’t get the shot, they..."
"In early August, Donald Trump suffered a drop in the polls in the wake of an especially bad week, which included him feuding with a Muslim Gold Star family whose son died fighting for the U.S. Army in Iraq. For the Record’s week in review summarized that week as “Trump hit rock bottom and then basically tried to dig to China.”"
"Opening a rare Sunday session of the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are continuing talks to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government--but gave no hint of progress in the negotiations.
""We’re in conversation today,"" Reid said on the Senate floor. ""I’m confident the Republicans will allow the government to open and extend the ability of the county to pay its bills. And I'm going to do everything I can throughout the day to accomplish just..."
"President Barack Obama said Monday there had been some progress in Senate negotiations on a possible compromise to reopen the federal government and avoid a U.S. default as soon as Thursday. And he added that the partial shutdown of the government for the past two weeks was ""completely unnecessary,"" and he blamed the use of ""brinksmanship as a strategy time and time again to try to extract extreme or partisan concessions."""
"Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat associated with major legislative achievements over five terms in the U.S. Senate and the chamber's last surviving World War II veteran, died on Monday of viral pneumonia, his office said.
Lautenberg, 89, missed key Senate votes late last year during a weeks-long absence because of a cold that turned into what he called a ""severe case of bronchitis with fluid in the chest."" He also battled stomach cancer in recent years.
He announced in a statement in February that he would not..."
"Washington (CNN) - The White House is making a concerted effort to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci as he becomes increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country amid a national surge in coronavirus cases. The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.
The tension between the two men -- who are no longer speaking, CNN reported last week -- has grown publicly as they have responded to one..."
"The South Florida principal who stirred national controversy after refusing to say the Holocaust was a “factual, historical event” was fired Wednesday during a school board meeting at the recommendation of the district’s superintendent.
With no discussion, the school board for the School District of Palm Beach County voted 5-2 to end William Latson’s more than 20-year-employment with the district.
Latson, who was the principal of Spanish River Community High School in Boca Raton for 11 years, was reassigned in July after emails he wrote to a mother’s inquiry in..."
"Elizabeth Warren was called out by rivals for a change, Joe Biden failed to stand out and Bernie Sanders calmed concerns about his health. Pete Buttigieg had his biggest night yet.
The CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night revealed new dynamics in the Democratic presidential race: Senator Elizabeth Warren took sustained fire from multiple rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. struggled to make an impact and Mayor Pete Buttigieg and other candidates were newly aggressive in making their points.
Here are six takeaways from the debate:

"The final piece of the 2022 Senate puzzle is about to be set.
Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan’s reelection campaign could be one of November’s most competitive races — but that depends on who wins Tuesday’s Republican primary in New Hampshire, the last nominating contest left in the battle to swing the 50-50 Senate.
The GOP’s establishment wing has lined up behind state Senate President Chuck Morse, who is mounting a late charge for the nomination against longtime polling leader Don Bolduc. But a leading Democratic super PAC has been attacking Morse..."
"For the first time in nearly a month, Donald Trump looks mortal again.
Four states held Republican primaries or caucuses on Saturday, but the GOP frontrunner came away with just two wins that were both quite narrow, in Louisiana and Kentucky. He lost the Maine caucuses — his first defeat in the Northeast — and got blown out in Kansas."
"A national railroad strike could begin Friday if additional agreements are not reached, which industry experts warn would shut down 30% of the country’s freight and halt many passenger and commuter trains. 
Several of the labor unions representing railroad workers in an ongoing contract dispute reached tentative agreements over the weekend, but two of the largest are still holding out for more quality-of-life provisions in their contracts. 
Here's how a railroad strike could impact you."
"In a fiery defense of his reputation Friday night, embattled Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz showed how former President Donald Trump's brash, defiant politics now serve as the template for survival for the most unwelcome figures in a Republican Party that's out of power in Washington and desperately trying to reposition for 2022.
He followed in the footsteps of the former President, blaming ""cancel culture"" for his troubles, fashioning himself as a crusader for the principles that Trump espoused and vowing that he was ""built for the battle"" while addressing the..."
"THURSDAY ENDED AS THE Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst day – in terms of value lost – since the Black Monday crash of 1987.
Trading was temporarily halted shortly after markets opened because of the steep declines – the second time the market's fail-safe had been triggered in mid-day trading this week. Both the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 closed the day down nearly 10%. The Dow dropped more than 2,300 points.
Outside of Black Monday and twice during the Great Depression of 1929, the Dow hasn't seen..."
"President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke Thursday amid growing tensions between the two countries around Taiwan, the economy and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The call, Biden's fifth with Xi, lasted over two hours, though past calls have lasted around as long because the conversations need to be translated. The two leaders discussed a number of issues hanging over both Biden and Xi at home and abroad, including the economic slowdowns facing both countries, the effects of Russia's invasion and the continuing Covid pandemic.
The two leaders also discussed..."
"A gunman who killed four people at a Tulsa hospital Wednesday targeted a doctor who had treated him and bought the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting on the day of the attack, police said.
Michael Louis was armed with a rifle, which he had purchased at 2 p.m. Wednesday, and a handgun when he went to St. Francis Hospital shortly before 5 p.m., officials said."
"Following days of lengthy debate among vaccine experts, booster shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine can now be officially administered to some adults in the United States.
Early Friday morning, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky diverged from the agency's independent vaccine advisers to recommend boosters for a broader group of people -- those ages 18 to 64 who are at increased risk of Covid-19 because of their workplaces or institutional settings -- in addition to older adults, long-term care facility residents and some people..."
"Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler revealed a big win for net neutrality advocates on Wednesday, asking for strong authority to enforce open Internet protections.
In a Wired op-ed, Wheeler said he is proposing the FCC use its authority under Title II of the Communications Act to protect consumer broadband Internet. This move will allow the FCC to stop Internet service providers from charging content providers like Netflix more money for reliable Internet access.
""Using this authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open Internet protections ever proposed..."
"New York (CNN Business) - In yet another sign that the economic recovery is teetering in a resurgence of coronavirus cases, the number of Americans filing first-time unemployment claims rose for the second week in a row.
Some 1.4 million people filed for initial jobless claims last week, up 12,000 from the prior week's revised level, which was the first increase in 16 weeks.
On an unadjusted basis, 1.2 million people filed first-time claims, down 171,000 from the week before. The seasonal adjustments are traditionally used to smooth out..."
"CNN's first Democratic debate on Tuesday night will showcase a match-up between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two icons of the progressive movement who are ultimately on a collision course for the party's presidential nomination.
Their encounter will kick off two televised clashes between Democratic White House hopefuls on successive nights that could significantly reshape the primary campaign and will, for the first time, test how party hopefuls handle Donald Trump's ugly campaign strategy rooted in direct racism.
The debates, each featuring 10 candidates, mark the biggest moment of..."
"The United States and Russia began high-stakes security talks on Monday, launching a diplomatic effort to defuse soaring tensions over a Russian military buildup on its border with Ukraine. 
But a breakthrough appeared unlikely, with Moscow's threats and low expectations from both sides clouding the possibility of an end to fears Russia is planning to invade its neighbor.
Ahead of a flurry of diplomatic activity in Europe this week, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman was holding face-to face talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva, Switzerland.
Ryabkov warned Sunday..."
"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., responded to calls for an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in light of new sexual misconduct allegations by saying that the panel has ""our hands full with impeaching the president.""
In a radio interview with WNYC on Monday, Nadler was asked if he’d be concerned with Democrats thinking he’s not taking the Kavanaugh allegations seriously enough. He said his committee has too much on its plate.
""We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now and that’s going to..."
"Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., will introduce an impeachment resolution against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following a new report of sexual misconduct.
“I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,” she said in a statement to Boston public radio station WBUR.
Pressley was referring to the two women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his contentious nomination process last October.
“Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation’s highest court..."
"The Food and Drug Administration has authorized a second booster dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine for older people and certain immunocompromised individuals.
The second booster may be given to people who are 50 and older or immunocompromised at least four months after they received the first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID vaccine. Immunocompromised people must be at least 12 to receive the 2nd Pfizer booster, and at least 18 to get the Moderna.

"Scientists are remarkably optimistic about their ability to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the coronavirus within the next six to 12 months. But even if those hopes come true, it is far from obvious that enough people will be willing to take the vaccine to halt the pandemic.
Long before COVID-19 arrived, a worrying number of parents refused to immunize their children against measles. The new virus has inspired an even louder movement of science deniers: Americans who have embraced quack remedies, ridiculed social-distancing measures, and decried masks..."
"The Justice Department's inspector general will investigate the department's handling of a leak investigation into former President Donald Trump's political enemies that included a subpoena to collect metadata of lawmakers, staff and some family members, the office announced Friday.
The request comes as House Intelligence Committee Democrats held a briefing led by Chairman Adam Schiff. A source said that members were 'animated' in trying to figure out who at the Justice Department and in the Trump administration were behind the effort to seize their records.
The activity follows the bombshell revelation that prosecutors in..."
"The rabbi froze in the lobby of his synagogue, startled by the stranger in sunglasses pointing a rifle at him. As the shots zoomed toward him, he raised his hands in defense before scrambling to gather the young children nearby and move them somewhere safe.
“Miraculously, the gun jammed,” said Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, speaking with bandaged hands at an emotionally charged news conference outside Chabad of Poway on Sunday, a day after the shooting.
A congregant, an Army veteran, chased after the shooter, but he managed to get away, Goldstein..."
"The Trump administration announced Friday a deal with CVS and Walgreens to administer a future coronavirus vaccine to seniors and staff in long-term care facilities with no out-of-pocket cost.
President Donald Trump — who polls show is trailing Joe Biden among Americans over 65 — referenced the deal in a Florida speech on “protecting seniors” Friday afternoon."
"The Democrats’ expansive elections and voting bill is all but certain to be rejected in a key test vote in the Senate, providing a dramatic example of Republicans’ use of the filibuster to block legislation and forcing hard questions for Democrats over next steps.
The far-reaching proposal, at nearly 900 pages, is viewed by backers as the civil rights issue of the era, legislation that is suddenly of the highest priority after the 2020 election as states impose restrictive new laws that could make it more difficult to vote. In the evenly split Senate, Republicans are..."
"Democrats in the Senate are trying this week to convince their Republican colleagues that updated voting rights legislation is necessary, but the bill they are bringing forward is unlikely to pass. 
The For the People Act, which passed in the House largely along party lines in March, is unlikely to pass the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster in the evenly divided Senate. In the House, one Democrat and all Republicans voted against it, and it has no Republican support in the Senate. One Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West..."
"Big-city mayors and housing experts are nervous about the idea of a billionaire real estate developer in the White House. Now President-elect Donald J. Trump has picked Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon with no housing experience, as his nominee for secretary of Housing and Urban Development — and high anxiety has set in."
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday called on Congress to impeach President Donald Trump in the wake of the publication of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, breaking with Democratic leaders deferring the politically risky move despite new evidence that Trump attempted to derail the Russia probe.
“To ignore a President’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways,”..."
The White House said Saturday it sees North Korea39s declaration of a quotstate of warquot against South Korea as just the latest quotunproductivequot provocation from Kim Jong-un39s government but is nonetheless taking the threat seriously. quotWe take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean alliesquot...
"Igor Danchenko, the primary source for the infamous Trump-Russia dossier, was acquitted Tuesday of four counts of lying to the FBI in an embarrassing defeat for special counsel John Durham.
Durham has taken two cases to trial, and both have ended in acquittals. After more than three years looking for misconduct in the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe, Durham has only secured one conviction: the guilty plea of a low-level FBI lawyer, who got probation.
The jury returned not guilty verdicts on all charges against Danchenko, a Russian expat and think tank analyst..."
"The school district in Uvalde, Texas, suspended its entire police force on Friday, five months after a shooting in which 19 children and two teachers were killed, the district said in a statement.
The moved followed a wave of outrage over the hiring of a former Texas state trooper who was part of the hesitant law enforcement response during the May shooting at Robb elementary school.
School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement..."
"A coast-to-coast winter storm swept from Oregon and Washington to the Southeast on Sunday, part of a frigid weather pattern that created record low temperatures in Minnesota and a 100-vehicle traffic pileup in Texas and that is now producing dangerous conditions across much of the country because of heavy snowfall, perilous ice and dangerously low temperatures.
The National Weather Service said early Monday that at least 150 million Americans were under ice or winter weather advisories. Hundreds of thousands of people were without power. Trucks slid off highways and cars..."
"A frigid blast of winter weather across the U.S. plunged Texas into an unusually icy emergency Monday that knocked out power to more than 2 million people, closed dangerously snowy and slick highways and put the delivery of new COVID-19 vaccine shipments on hold.
Temperatures nosedived into the single-digits as far south as San Antonio, and homes that had already been without electricity for hours had no certainty about when the lights and heat would come back on, as the state’s overwhelmed power grid throttled into rotating blackouts that are..."
"Following the bombshell release of a draft decision showing a majority of US supreme court justices may overturn Roe v Wade, legal experts believe other laws about individual autonomy may be in danger, including the right to access contraception.
Laws broadly banning abortion may also prohibit certain forms of birth control that opponents incorrectly say are working as abortion-causing medications. And the supreme court decision underpinning the right to access contraception, Griswold v Connecticut, could also come under fire in much the same way as Roe did."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled his planned summit with Kim Jong Un, scolding the North Korean leader for ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" while also bluntly reminding Kim of the United States' nuclear prowess.
“Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,” Trump wrote in a letter to Kim that was released by the White House."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is shortening the recommended quarantine period from 14 days after a person has been exposed to the coronavirus, offering two alternatives, the agency said Wednesday.
The first alternative is to end quarantine after 10 days if no symptoms are reported, Dr. Henry Walke, the CDC’s Covid-19 incident manager, said on a call with reporters. The second option is to end quarantine after seven days if an individual tests negative and also reports no symptoms."
"The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced the recommended days a person must quarantine after coronavirus exposure from 14 days to seven or 10 days.
The new guidelines announced Wednesday say people who have close contact with an infected person can end their quarantine after seven days if they receive a negative test or after 10 days without a test.
The CDC defines close contact as 15 minutes total spent 6 feet or closer to an infected person. Dr. Henry Walke, incident manager for the CDC’s COVID-19 response,..."
"The directions from police were terse: ""Follow us.""
Hundreds of refugees from the Middle East made the final leg of their trip through Hungary on foot, walking the 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) to the Austrian border in the middle of the night, unsure of what was going to happen to them when they got there.
After a train ride from the Croatia-Hungary border, about 300 to 400 people were trekking through the dark early Sunday with Hungarian police as their guides through the village of Hegyeshalom."
"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on the United States to accept significantly more Syrian refugees than it already has in an interview Sunday.
President Barack Obama has instructed his administration to be prepared to admit at least 10,000 refugees, but advocates for refugees have said that is an insufficient number to deal with the more than 4 million Syrians who have been displaced. On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Clinton said the U.S. ""has to do more.""
""We're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World..."
"It now appears a sudden, complete explosion caused by a bomb brought down the Airbus over the Mediterranean—but that doesn't mean it was ISIS. The evidence is building that EgyptAir Flight MS804 was brought down by a sudden and catastrophic explosion, consistent with a bomb having been detonated on board.
Flight tracking data showing its altitude, speed, and direction, ends instantaneously while the plane was at its cruise height of 37,000 feet. This can now be combined with reports that a military satellite using infrared technology detected a flash at..."
"An Egyptian jetliner carrying 66 people from Paris to Cairo abruptly swerved, vanished from radar and plunged into the Mediterranean early Thursday, shortly before it was scheduled to land. Egyptian officials said wreckage had been found and suggested terrorism was a more likely cause than technical failure.
The loss of the flight, EgyptAir 804, was the second civilian aviation disaster for Egypt in the past year. It immediately resurrected fears and speculation about the safety and security of Egyptian air travel and broader questions about terrorism against civilian air travel...."
"Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is refuting a Wall Street Journal report that the US military was developing plans to keep up to 1,000 troops in Syria, calling it ""factually incorrect.""
""There has been no change to the plan announced in February and we continue to implement the President's direction to draw down U.S. forces to a residual presence,"" Dunford said in a statement Sunday.
The Journal reported Sunday, citing US officials, that the US planned to continue working with Kurdish fighters in Syria..."
"President Donald Trump says the United States is putting additional sanctions on Iran and that he would support a course of action to ""make Iran great again"" should Tehran agree to a nuclear weapons ban.
""We're putting additional sanctions on, they're going on slowly and, in some cases, pretty rapidly, but additional sanctions are being put on Iran,"" the President told reporters on the South Lawn Saturday before departing to Camp David."
"The United States reported 3,865 Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday, the highest number of deaths reported in a single day since the pandemic began. The nation's death toll as of Thursday stands at more than 364,500, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, while the number of people who have been infected has topped more than 21.53 million. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent forecast projected there will be between 405,000 and 438,000 deaths by the end of the month. The previous forecast, published December 30, projected up..."
"(CNN) - If you've heard of ""40 acres and a mule,"" then you know that the concept of America paying reparations for the enslavement of black people is by no means a new idea.
The concept has been discussed since 1865 when the promise to repay -- I use that term loosely -- former slaves was made by Union Gen. William T. Sherman and then backed by President Abraham Lincoln and Congress.
As we know, the promise would be broken (when President Andrew Johnson withdrew the offer)."
"As he gently told a traumatized 8-year-old girl, ""Don't be scared, honey. Don't be scared,"" Joe Biden showed that the days of presidential pandemic denial and indifference to America's suffering are over.
His reassuring words to second grader Layla Salas came during a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday night when he also tried to move the nation on from the divisive aftermath of the impeachment trial of the predecessor he referred to as ""the former guy.""
""For four years, all that's been in the news is Trump. The..."
"  Mayor de Blasio on Monday attacked city firefighters for feigning illness to protest vaccination mandates — and promised consequences for those who don’t report to their jobs.
De Blasio employed the threatening rhetoric on the first day that city employees who’ve refused to get the vaccination can be docked pay for doing so. As of Monday morning, he said a total of 9,000 city workers are on leave without pay, or about 6% of the entire city workforce, which is approximately 378,000 strong.
But on Monday, he seemed to..."
"Thousands of New York municipal workers, including police officers and firefighters, have chosen unpaid leave rather than getting inoculated against COVID-19, as the city's vaccine mandate went into effect.
Speaking on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said he expected no disruptions as a result of some 9,000 city employees, or about 6% of the 378,000-strong workforce, getting put on unpaid leave for failing to get a shot. Those workers must show proof of at least one dose of a vaccination to return to work, according to the Oct. 20 order.
However,..."
"Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced on Monday that some forces are being repositioned inside Iraq, not leaving the country.
Two other U.S. officials told NPR some are going to Kuwait temporarily.
Esper also told reporters at the Pentagon an Iraqi Parliament vote on Sunday to expel the U.S. troops was nonbinding, and that there are no plans to leave Iraq yet.
The Pentagon press office underscored the message, saying in a tweet, ""There has been no change in U.S. policy with regard to our force presence in Iraq. We..."
"Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Monday that the United States has not made any decision to leave Iraq, shortly after the U.S. military said in a letter to Iraqi officials that U.S. forces would be relocating “to prepare for onward movement.”
On Sunday, Iraqi lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution calling for foreign troops to withdraw.
In the letter, released Monday, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III said that U.S. forces “respect your sovereign decision to order our departure.” A U.S. military official confirmed the letter’s authenticity.

"The next crucial step in the United States' Pony Express version of democracy is upon us -- and so is the final opportunity in President Donald Trump's desperate quest to overturn results from the election he lost.
Wednesday is the culmination of the Electoral College process, when states' votes determined by the results of the November 3 general election are formally counted during a joint session of Congress. We know the results -- Biden won 306 electoral votes, beating Trump's 232 -- but the congressional session seals Joe Biden's victory,..."
"Harry Reid, the wily Democratic Senate leader, was likely — once again — to be one of the most vulnerable incumbents up for re-election in 2016.
Few, though, would have bet the house against Reid — a sharp-elbowed campaigner — especially in a presidential year when demography will favor Democrats in a state where almost 3 in 10 people are Hispanic.
""Do you really want to go up against Harry Reid?"" said one national GOP operative, pointing out Reid's bare-knuckles style of campaigning."
"Around 8 p.m. Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, called Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York into his office with news that would stun Washington the next morning: Mr. Reid planned to retire at the end of his term.
Mr. Reid’s decision to contact Mr. Schumer first, before even President Obama, was another powerful reminder of what Senate Democrats have long known: Mr. Schumer — the flip-phone using, rumpled, relentless son of a Brooklyn exterminator — is the presumptive front-runner to lead the Senate Democrats when..."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday gave credence to a false and racist conspiracy theory about Kamala Harris’ eligibility to be vice president, fueling an online misinformation campaign that parallels the one he used to power his rise into politics.
Asked about the matter at the White House, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris, a Black woman and U.S.-born citizen whose parents were immigrants, does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious.”
The conspiracy theory is..."
"President Trump on Thursday encouraged a racist conspiracy theory that is rampant among some of his followers: that Senator Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic vice-presidential nominee born in California, was not eligible for the vice presidency or presidency because her parents were immigrants.
That assertion is false. Ms. Harris is eligible to serve.
Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Thursday, nevertheless pushed forward with the attack, reminiscent of the lie he perpetrated for years that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya.
“I heard it today that she doesn’t meet..."
"(CNN) -- Egyptians swarmed Cairo's Tahrir Square Tuesday, seeking to revive a democratic groundswell that swept the country's former strongman from power nearly two years ago and to demand that the man they chose to replace him respect their wishes.
Protesters waved flags and banners, chanted slogans and called on President Mohamed Morsy to roll back his decree on presidential powers or resign. The crowd included many different Egyptian factions, including Western-style liberals, secularists, moderates and women's rights activists.
""We ask you, Mr. President, to stop this for..."

"Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Monday granting Russian citizenship to the US whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Snowden, 39, a former US intelligence contractor, has been living in Russia since 2013 to escape prosecution in the US after leaking secret files, published by the Guardian, that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the US National Security Agency.
In 2020, Snowden said that he and his then-pregnant wife were applying for Russian citizenship in order not to be separated from their future son in an era of pandemics and closed..."
"(CNN)The House of Representatives took the historic step to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday, charging a president with high crimes and misdemeanors for just the third time in American history.
The House voted almost entirely along party lines -- 230-197 -- to charge Trump with abuse of power. The House will now immediately vote on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, which is also expected to pass solely with Democratic votes."
"A day after President Donald Trump confirmed that he planned to wind down the White House coronavirus task force, the president announced Wednesday that it will now continue indefinitely.
In a series of tweets, Trump said the task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, has done a “fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources that have set a high standard for others to follow in the future.”
Trump said that ventilators are now being produced in the thousands, repeated the false claim that the U.S. is doing..."
"Less than a day after signaling the White House task force on coronavirus would be disbanded, President Donald Trump said Wednesday the group will ""continue on indefinitely"" and shift focus to reopening and manufacturing vaccines.
Trump's latest thinking on the task force, created in January to coordinate the response to the virus, came a day after Vice President Mike Pence and other officials said the group's work would be transferred to federal agencies as soon as this month. The idea drew fire from some critics who said it was too..."
"This morning on MSNBC's Morning Joe, there was a tense confrontation between Chris Matthews and the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
Well, perhaps calling it a confrontation might imply two were involved when for most part, it was Matthews dumping on Priebus, whose party he accused of playing the ""race card."""
"AMPA, Fla. -- In an emotional interview with POLITICO tonight, MSNBC host Chris Matthews defended his spirited attack against RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, in which he alleged that the Republican party was guilty of playing the race card against President Barack Obama.
""It is obvious that this is something I care passionately about: race was abused by white politicians in my lifetime, including Reagan. For someone to come on the program and deny that this is part of their process, I couldn't take that,"" Matthews said. ""This is something I..."
"Democrats aren’t just eager for Donald Trump to cannonball into the 2024 presidential race before the fall midterms. Across the country, they are actively plotting ways to immediately capitalize on a pre-November announcement.
Campaigns and officials at major Democratic outfits are planning to capture the anticipated cash windfall that would come their way should Trump announce he’s making another run at the White House. Candidates also are exploring ways to exploit Trump’s premature entry to energize despondent base voters and coalesce independents and suburb-dwellers who have soured on the party..."
"Authorities in Canada say they are beginning to arrest truckers who have paralyzed traffic in Ottawa for three weeks in a protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions.
Police in Ottawa tweeted that some protesters are surrendering and being arrested Friday morning outside Parliament Hill.

"In anticipation of the Supreme Court’s hearing on Wednesday to consider Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks, there has been much conversation about what will happen if the court’s conservatives overrule abortion rights cemented in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In fact, the implications of such a ruling would go far beyond just abortion.
In Casey, the Supreme Court formulated an “undue burden” test to limit state regulation of abortion up to viability of a fetus, replacing the trimester formulation under Roe. But Casey also left a long trail of case law that..."

"Two years ago, candidate Joe Biden loudly denounced President Donald Trump for immigration policies that inflicted “cruelty and exclusion at every turn,” including toward those fleeing the “brutal” government of socialist Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.
Now, with increasing numbers of Venezuelans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border as the Nov. 8 election nears, Biden has turned to an unlikely source for a solution: his predecessor’s playbook.

"On Wednesday, House impeachment managers had senators riveted to disturbing new security camera video that showed just how close the rioters that breached the U.S. Capitol came to lawmakers in the House and Senate chambers.
Wednesday's images, from several angles outside the chambers and in hallways outside leadership offices, showed one Capitol police officer run past Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney and direct him to turn around and run, as rioters were closing in on that location just off the Senate floor.
Ominously, the video also showed staffers for House..."
"House impeachment managers on Wednesday led a rapt U.S. Senate on a harrowing retelling of the terror that engulfed the Capitol last month, sharing shocking new audio and video recordings of rioters declaring their intent to harm Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials — and showing how close they came to doing so.
The House Democrats, led by lead manager Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), spent Day 2 of former president Donald Trump’s impeachment trial displaying violent video scenes of the Jan. 6 attack and the rioters’ relentlessly raw..."
"Sen. John McCain is chastising GOP leaders for failing to embrace Donald Trump as the choice of millions of voters, laying out his most extensive views to date about Trump at the top of the ticket. He's also repudiating some of the presumptive nominee's comments -- particularly about prisoners of war.
In a wide-ranging ""State of the Union"" interview in his campaign office in Phoenix, McCain criticized party leaders who are reluctant to back Trump, saying they are ""out of step"" with voters who have chosen the controversial businessman as..."
"Senate Republicans sank Democrats’ plans to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling on Monday evening, sending congressional leaders scrambling to avoid a government shutdown that would kick in Friday morning.
The GOP rejected a proposal to fund the government into December and lift the debt ceiling past next year’s midterms, a vote that needed the support of 10 Republicans to advance over a GOP filibuster. But only a handful of GOP senators even considered it, and the bill appeared doomed for days. Needing 60 votes, the bill failed,..."
"SEOUL, South Korea — There was one state event that the secretive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, never missed: a visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun every April 15 to mark the birthday of his grandfather, the founder of the dynastic regime. In the mausoleum, both his grandfather and his father lie in state."
"After testing positive for Covid-19 last week, President Joe Biden’s symptoms “continue to improve significantly,” the White House physician said in a memo Sunday.
Biden finished a third day of treatment with the antiviral Paxlovid on Saturday night and his “predominant symptom now is a sore throat,” wrote Kevin O’Connor, the physician to the president. He noted that the sore throat was likely a result of Biden’s body clearing the virus, and that the previously reported nasal drip, body aches and cough have “diminished considerably.”
O’Connor also wrote that Biden was experiencing..."
"Former President Donald Trump conjured a vision of a second term that would function as a tool of personal vengeance, and become even more authoritarian than his first, when he vowed to pardon US Capitol insurrectionists if he runs for the White House again and wins.
His pledge at a Texas rally Saturday was accompanied by a call for demonstrations if prosecutors in New York, who are probing Trump's business practices, and those in Georgia, looking into his attempts to reverse his election loss in the state, do anything that he defined..."

"President Biden on Tuesday announced harsh new sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for what he called “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,” joining European leaders in imposing severe economic consequences for blatant violations of national sovereignty.
Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Mr. Biden condemned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his aggression against Ukraine, saying that the Russian action is “a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community.”"
"More than 1,100 former prosecutors and officials at the Department of Justice called on Attorney General Bill Barr to resign Sunday after he intervened in the case of Roger Stone to reduce the recommended sentence of President Trump’s longtime friend and quasi-adviser.

"ATTORNEY GENERAL William P. Barr on Monday ordered federal police and National Guard forces to disperse protesters who were peacefully gathered in front of the White House. As flash munitions exploded and tear gas swirled, President Trump delivered a Rose Garden rant denouncing “acts of domestic terror” he said had taken place in Washington and other U.S. cities, and threatened to “deploy the United States military” to those that fail to “dominate the streets.”
The president then walked across Lafayette Square to pose with a Bible in front of a..."

The Senate ended a 27-hour marathon overnight session Saturday by narrowly passing a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. Senators voted 50-49 along party lines with one Republican—Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska—absent. The approval got Democrats one step closer to fulfilling one of the biggest early priorities for President Joe Biden. Now the bill must go back to the House of Representatives. Although a small group of moderate Democrats pushed some changes in the final bill that angered progressives that isn’t expected to lead to a rejection of the measure in...
"The Democratic-controlled Senate Saturday overcame Republican roadblocks and a debate that lasted beyond 24 hours to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package which would provide millions of Americans with $1,400 direct payments, billions of dollars for vaccine distribution, and funds to help reopen schools and colleges.
The chamber passed the bill following a session that began around 9 a.m. Friday and ended at approximately 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, aft a ""vote-a-rama"" of proposed changes from both parties. The final vote was 50-49 with all Republicans voting against..."

"The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to make the economic model work.
Under the law, insurance companies are required to cover anyone. But in order to make that economically feasible, everyone has to buy insurance."
"For nearly five years, Republicans have struggled to make a scandal stick to President Barack Obama's White House. One by one, the controversies — with shorthand names such as Solyndra, Benghazi, and Fast and Furious — hit a fever pitch, then faded away.
But some Republicans see the disastrous rollout of Obama's health law as a problem with the kind of staying power they have sought.
The health care failures are tangible for millions of Americans and can be experienced by anyone with Internet access. The law itself is more..."
"A House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection voted unanimously to hold former White House aide Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress after the longtime ally of former President Donald Trump defied a subpoena for documents and testimony.
Still defending his supporters who broke into the Capitol that day, Trump has aggressively tried to block the committee’s work by directing Bannon and others not to answer questions in the probe. Trump has also filed a lawsuit to try to prevent Congress from obtaining former White House documents.
But lawmakers have made clear they will not..."
"One would think that Friday’s announcement that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest point since Barack Obama took office would be good news for the president. Yet as the unemployment rate has declined, President Obama’s job approval rating has worsened.
So it’s not clear how much of an effect modest changes in the economy’s condition will have on his approval ratings.
The economy outpaced all other issues in importance to voters in a New York Times/CBS News poll in mid-September, and 44 percent of Americans rated the economy..."
"North Korea is apparently moving to sell millions of rockets and artillery shells — many of them likely from its old stock — to its Cold War ally Russia.
Russia has called a U.S. intelligence report on the purchasing plan “fake.” But U.S. officials say it shows Russia’s desperation with the war in Ukraine and that Moscow could buy additional military hardware from North Korea.
The ammunitions North Korea reportedly intends to sell to Moscow are likely copies of Soviet-era weapons that can fit Russian launchers. But there are still questions over..."

"A jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has begun hearing evidence that will help them decide whether Kyle Rittenhouse is guilty of reckless or intentional homicide in the shooting of three people during August 2020 racial injustice protests, or if he acted in self-defense.
What’s really on trial, though, is citizen vigilantism. At a moment when Americans’ willingness to use political violence has already skyrocketed, this trial’s outcome risks legitimizing individual violent action and galvanizing civilians who are unhappy with the direction of the country to take matters into their own hands. This..."
"The first week of testimony has come to a close in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old charged with homicide after he shot and killed two protesters at a demonstration in Kenosha, Wis., in August 2020.
The protests in Kenosha began after police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, on Aug. 23, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Multiple nights of unrest followed, with rioters destroying police cars and burning and damaging businesses.
On Aug. 25, ahead of the third night of protests, Rittenhouse, then 17, drove..."

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was dead-set against giving unrestricted funds to states and local governments in the covid-19 relief bill the Senate passed Tuesday. Instead, he wants states to be able to declare bankruptcy, which would mean pension plans, government contractors, union workers and a whole slew of other stakeholders would suffer. He blithely declares, after spending trillions of dollars on everything from airline bailouts to small-business loans to enhanced employment that we shouldn’t borrow to fund state and local governments.

"This week, the US and Iran laid out a framework for the broad strokes of a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. But now, members of Congress are trying to weigh in — and potentially kill it. Can they?
A proposed bill from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) would create a path to block Obama from carrying out a key feature of any eventual agreement — lifting the Congressional sanctions on Iran — if veto-proof supermajorities in each chamber voted to disapprove the deal."
"Despite the White House’s strong push to rally its congressional allies behind an Iran deal, Senate Republicans think they’re close to having enough Democratic support to move forward with a bill that would give lawmakers the final say over any nuclear agreement with Tehran, according to interviews with key members of Congress.

While noting that there were pros and cons to such a move, Fauci said it was “just another one of the requirements that I think is reasonable to consider,” along with similar requirements at some universities and workplaces.
“That’s another incentive to get more people vaccinated,” he said during an appearance on MSNBC...."
"It was 90 minutes of chaos in a year of upheaval. But did it matter?
President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared onstage together for the first time on Tuesday. It was not exactly a debate.
Shouting, interruptions and often incoherent cross talk filled the air as Mr. Trump purposefully and repeatedly heckled and blurted over his rival and the moderator alike in a 90-minute melee that showcased the president’s sense of urgency to upend a race in which polls show him trailing.

Reid claims Romney hasnt paid taxes (again).

"President Joe Biden is set to sign two executive orders on Monday which will establish the White House Gender Policy Council and address sexual violence in the education field.
The orders, to be signed on International Woman's Day, are aimed at ensuring gender equality and equity throughout the federal government at a time when women, particularly Black and Latina women, are being disproportionately afflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

"San Francisco police said six people were injured, including three officers, during clashes between a small group of President Trump’s supporters and a larger crowd of counterprotesters Saturday near Civic Center. No arrests had been made by early Saturday evening.
The pro-Trump protest, billed as a free speech rally, drew people from Team Save America wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and carrying pro-police “Thin Blue Line” flags. They set up a stage at the Federal Building at U.N. Plaza, but dozens of black-clad demonstrators quickly gathered to oppose the..."
"A free speech demonstration staged by conservative activists quickly fell apart in downtown San Francisco on Saturday after several hundred counterprotesters surged the area, outnumbering and attacking those gathered, including knocking one in the mouth.

Team Save America organized the rally to protest Twitter, which it said squelches conservative speech."
"At least four members of Congress have reaped benefits in some way from the half-trillion-dollar small-business loan program they helped create.
And no one knows how many more there could be.
It’s a bipartisan group of lawmakers who have acknowledged close ties to companies that have received loans from the program — businesses that are either run by their families or employ their spouse as a senior executive.
Republicans on the list include Rep. Roger Williams of Texas, a wealthy businessman who owns auto dealerships, body shops and car washes,..."
"At least four members of Congress benefited from loans under the $670 billion Paycheck Protection Program — and there are no rules requiring them to reveal that they did so.
Politico first reported that a small group of Republicans and Democrats have close connections to businesses known to have taken loans under PPP, the small business aid program. Companies that benefited from the loans are either managed by the lawmakers' families or employ spouses in senior and sometimes executive roles.
Those on the GOP side include Texas Rep. Roger Williams,..."
"The Supreme Court declined an invitation to blow up the 2020 presidential election on Monday. The justices ruled unanimously that states may compel electors, the individuals who make up the Electoral College, to vote for the winner of the statewide presidential race by either removing or fining “faithless electors.” In truth, this decision should not have been necessary: There is no serious constitutional argument that states are powerless to dictate electors’ votes. But the nation can breathe a sigh of relief that the court did not take the bait to..."
"Prince Andrew’s motion to get the civil case against him dropped has been dismissed by a New York federal judge.
In the civil case, Virginia Giuffre accuses the Duke of York of having sex with her when she was 17 – and therefore a minor – in 2001.
Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.
Giuffre also alleges that she was trafficked to the royal by the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell between 2000 and 2002.
The judge’s decision followed a hearing last Tuesday, where Andrew’s legal team suggested a newly-released document dating back..."
"Chinese authorities on Sunday violently dispersed a peaceful protest by hundreds of depositors, who sought in vain to demand their life savings back from banks that have run into a deepening cash crisis.
Since April, four rural banks in China's central Henan province have frozen millions of dollars worth of deposits, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of customers in an economy already battered by draconian Covid lockdowns.
Anguished depositors have staged several demonstrations in the city of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of Henan, over the past two months, but..."
"The Justice Department has declared that New York, Seattle, and Portland are “anarchist” jurisdictions and threatened them with a loss of federal funding, another escalation in the Trump administration’s war on cities with Democrat mayors that saw huge protests against police brutality this summer.
All three cities saw large, sustained protests this summer after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The cities “permitted violence and destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities,” the Justice Department said in..."
"At the first Democratic primary debate, it was clear the main goal for several candidates was to merely get their name on the national radar.
The crowded stage of 10 made it especially difficult. But a few candidates found a way to stand out.
During the debate, several tweets noted the massive spike in Sen. Cory Booker’s search traffic. But by the end of the night, two other candidates emerged from the crowded field — enough to get Americans searching their name.
One was New York City Mayor Bill de..."
"Hillary Clinton named Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia to be her running mate Friday, selecting a battleground-state politician with working-class roots and a fluency in Spanish, traits that she believes can bolster her chances to defeat Donald J. Trump in November.
Mrs. Clinton’s choice, which she announced via text message to supporters, came after her advisers spent months poring over potential vice-presidential candidates who could lift the Democratic ticket in an unpredictable race against Mr. Trump."
"It’s officially Tim Kaine.
Hillary Clinton announced today that Sen. Tim Kaine will be her presidential running-mate, pushing the mild-mannered Virginian into a glaring national spotlight. ""I'm thrilled to tell you this first: I've chosen Sen. Tim Kaine as my running mate. Welcome him to our team,"" the former Secretary of State said in a text to her supporters.
Kaine, a former governor and current senator, was the safe choice for the cautious Democratic nominee—but that doesn't mean he won't have an impact."
"Donald Trump keeps trying to convince any disbelieving holdouts that he is a raging racist. At least, that’s how I imagine his motives. In truth, it is more likely that his truest nature is simply being revealed, again and again, and he is using his own racism to appeal to the racism in the people who support him.
On Sunday morning, the same day that the Trump administration earlier announced it would conduct raids to round up undocumented immigrants, Trump weighed in again on the conflict between four female freshmen..."
"With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color, President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life.
He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics — the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants.
Although three of the four women were born in the United States, the president said they should all ""go back"" where they came from. That phrase has echoed down generations of nativist discourse as successive waves..."
"As hopeful Republicans anticipate how their new select committee will get the Benghazi issue a full airing, and as Democrats gnash their teeth at what they're calling a political stunt, here's another possible scenario: It won't make much difference either way.
The new committee has subpoena power — just like the House Oversight Committee, which has already been investing Benghazi. The new committee will be able to look at classified material — just like the House Intelligence Committee, which has also been investigating Benghazi."
"In an appearance on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher, Arianna skewered Republicans for their continued efforts to turn Benghazi into a scandal.
Earlier this week, the House voted to create a new committee to investigate the 2012 attack in Libya. Both Senate and House Republicans have been using the tragedy as a way to appeal to potential donors to their 2014 election campaigns.

"America's economic recovery has hit a roadblock: US employers added only 194,000 jobs in September, another troubling sign that Covid is disrupting the economy.
It marked the second-straight month in which the US economy added far fewer jobs than expected. Jobs growth slowed down dramatically in August.
The unemployment rate declined to 4.8% in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday, down from 5.2% in August.
But, if you're an optimist, there is reason to be hopeful about the future: The surveys behind the jobs report were completed around the middle of..."
"U.S. employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, a second straight tepid gain and evidence that the pandemic still has a grip on the economy with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs.
Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate fell sharply to 4.8% from 5.2% in August.
The economy is showing some signs of emerging from the drag of the delta variant of the coronavirus, with confirmed new COVID-19 infections declining, restaurant traffic picking up slightly and consumers eager to spend.

"California is approaching an energy crossroads. In three years, its last nuclear plant will begin to power down and the state will lose its largest single source of emissions-free electricity.
A 2018 law requires state regulators to “avoid any increase in greenhouse gases” as a result of closing the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant on the Central Coast. But if they don’t move more quickly to replace its electricity with renewable energy from wind, solar and geothermal, the void will almost certainly be filled by burning more natural gas, which increased..."

Newsom first brought up the idea in December after Texas lawmakers passed a bill allowing private citizens to sue people who get..."
"As the Senate began reviewing the FBI’s completed report on Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh on Thursday morning, both Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley and the White House stood by President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, saying the investigation found nothing sufficient to corroborate allegations of sexual misconduct while he was a teenager."
"The Justice Department on Friday released a partially blacked-out document explaining the justification for an FBI search of former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate earlier this month, when agents removed top secret government records and other classified documents.
The document, even in its redacted form, is likely to offer at least some new details about an ongoing criminal investigation that has brought fresh legal peril for Trump just as he lays the groundwork for another presidential run.
Though Justice Department officials were expected to have removed sensitive details about witnesses, and the..."
"The United States broke its record for the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases reported in a single day on Friday, an alarming sign that what some epidemiologists are calling a “third wave” of infections is spreading at breakneck speed as winter approaches.
According to the New York Times, by the end of the day on Friday, at least 85,085 cases were reported across the country — about 10,000 cases more than the previous same-day high on July 16.

"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has officially secured a majority of GOP delegates, giving him the ""magic number"" required to clinch the GOP nomination.
Trump passed the 1,237 mark after unbound delegates from North Dakota, Colorado and Pennsylvania pledged their support for him.
NBC News declared the real estate mogul to be the presumptive Republican nominee after his remaining GOP competitors dropped out of the race in early May.
Trump will not officially become the nominee until he accepts the nomination at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July."
"Testing is the key that will unlock normalization for millions of Americans.
It's the doorway between the disaster response mode of the pandemic and confidence about returning to work, school and life. And it's also still apparently weeks or more away from scaling to a level that will make a big difference for most people in most places.
Precisely how far away isn't clear, although President Trump and a pageant of guests attempted on Monday to sell the idea that victory is just around the corner.

"President Donald Trump announced a new federal coronavirus testing ""blueprint"" Monday to aid governors in ramping up capacity as a handful of states begin lifting stay-at-home restrictions.
Trump, who was not originally scheduled to hold a briefing, billed the plan as part of the administration's push for a ""phased and very safe reopening"" of the U.S. over the next few months. He said the plan includes provisions to expand state testing capacity and establish widespread monitoring systems, as well as contact tracing.
""We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity..."
"Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced a second day of tough congressional questions Tuesday about the Biden administration’s much-criticized withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Blinken sought to parry a new wave of bipartisan lawmaker anger over the operation that resulted in the complete takeover by the Taliban, and has left many American citizens, green card holders and at-risk Afghans stranded in the country.
The top two members of the committee, New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez and Idaho Republican James Risch, both assailed the withdrawal as..."
"Democrats kept control of the Senate on Saturday, repelling Republican efforts to retake the chamber and making it harder for them to thwart President Joe Biden’s agenda. The fate of the House was still uncertain as the GOP struggled to pull together a slim majority there.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s victory in Nevada gave Democrats the 50 seats they needed to keep the Senate. Her win reflects the surprising strength of Democrats across the U.S. this election year. Seeking reelection in an economically challenged state that has some of the highest gas prices in the..."
"In a campaign where both sides debated New York values, what New York values most is candidates who call it home, it seems.
The ultimate value of New York, though, is questionable in the march to the party nominations. Wins by the front-runners don’t alter stubborn mathematical realities that are likely to leave Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton with company in the race for a while longer."

"Give them credit for this one: Democrats have fought hard to stop Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump’s blazingly unqualified pick for education secretary. With just hours to go before the vote, DeVos currently has the votes to squeak through on a tie-breaker from Mike Pence, but the pressure is still on Republicans to flip and sink her nomination. Democrats took the Senate floor and spoke all night against DeVos, raising some damn good points:"

"Hospitals are threatening to fire health-care workers who publicize their working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic -- and have in some cases followed through.
Ming Lin, an emergency room physician in Washington state, said he was told Friday he was out of a job because he’d given an interview to a newspaper about a Facebook post detailing what he believed to be inadequate protective equipment and testing. In Chicago, a nurse was fired after emailing colleagues that she wanted to wear a more protective mask while on duty. In New..."
"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr declared on Monday that a deadly shooting last month at a naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., was an act of terrorism, and he asked Apple in an unusually high-profile request to provide access to two phones used by the gunman.

"The House Intelligence Committee concluded that President Trump tried to “use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.”
House Democrats on Tuesday asserted that President Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to help him in the 2020 presidential election, releasing an impeachment report that found the president “placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States.”
The report by the House Intelligence Committee was a sweeping indictment of the president’s behavior, concluding that..."

"This article tracking Hurricane Ian is available for free as a public service to all readers.
Hurricane Ian’s projected path shifted slightly Tuesday, on a track that would push the powerful storm to an earlier potential landfall south of the Tampa Bay area — a small but significant change for a Gulf Coast vulnerable to storm surge. If the track holds — and forecasts stress that it may still change — it could reduce the flooding threat to Tampa Bay but raise it for coastal communities to the south like..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday said two provisions of an Arizona voting law that restrict how ballots can be cast do not violate the historic Voting Rights Act that bars regulations that result in racial discrimination.

"To the world, Madeleine Albright will always be remembered as America’s first woman secretary of state. She thrived in that role as a consequence of her intelligence, strength, and her mastery of a profoundly challenging role at a time when the United States was, briefly, the world’s sole superpower.
In a moment during her tenure as secretary of state that resonates greatly with the current one, a brutal authoritarian leader, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, threatened the peace of Europe."

"In the beginning, Donald Trump said “I alone” can fix everything. Then, as the pandemic gripped the nation, Trump said, the Constitution required the states to take the lead and mandated that governors compete amongst themselves for critical medical equipment and decide whether or not to impose stay-at-home orders to protect their citizens’ lives.
But more recently, things took a different turn. Trump has declared that the country must be “liberated” in plenty of time for the fall election season. And if the states don’t agree, Trump is making..."

"Hillary Clinton, hopeful Tuesday that she was poised to shatter the nation's ""highest and hardest glass ceiling,"" instead Wednesday publicly conceded the presidential race to Donald Trump, saying the nation owed ""him an open mind and the chance to lead.""
“I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans,"" Clinton told supporters, including her staff, as she tried to strike a hopeful note despite what she described as a ""painful"" loss.
“I still believe in American, and I always will,"" Clinton said, surrounded by her family, including..."
"At about 8 a.m. on March 6, 1998, Matthew Beck arrived to work at the headquarters of the Connecticut State Lottery. He hung up his coat, walked into an office and shot the first of four victims.
Beck ended up killing a number of his co-workers and then took his own life in the parking lot when the police arrived.
Mike Lawlor, the Connecticut governor's criminal justice adviser, was a state representative at the time, and wanted to understand what led to the rampage. He learned that Beck had previously..."
"The White House and Republican leaders knew that the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of their American Health Care Act was not going to be helpful. They have laid the groundwork for rejecting the CBO numbers well in advance, with press secretary Sean Spicer disparaging the CBO's prior estimates last week, and a slew of administration and House officials appeared on the Sunday talk shows to set expectations for viewers."
"So, was the Congressional Budget Office really “way, way off … in every aspect” of how it predicted that Obamacare would work, as the White House claims? No, it wasn’t.
The CBO actually nailed the overall impact of the law on the uninsured pretty closely. It predicted a big drop in the percentage of people under age 65 who would lack insurance, and that turned out to be the case. CBO projected that in 2016 that nonelderly rate would fall to 11%, and the latest figure put the actual rate..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, alarmed by President Donald Trump's erratic behavior in recent days, is putting her weight behind a bill to give Congress a role in determining whether the President of the United States must be forced out of office because he's incapable of doing his job.
The move, in response to Trump's conduct in the days after testing positive for the coronavirus, would establish a process to effectively give Congress a say in removing a president from office under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which allows for..."
"John H. Durham, the Trump-era special counsel scrutinizing the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference, distanced himself on Thursday from false reports by right-wing news outlets that a motion he recently filed said Hillary Clinton’s campaign had paid to spy on Trump White House servers.
Citing a barrage of such reports on Fox News and elsewhere based on the prosecutor’s Feb. 11 filing, defense lawyers for a Democratic-linked cybersecurity lawyer, Michael Sussmann, have accused the special counsel of including unnecessary and misleading information in filings “plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage..."
"John Kasich will end his bid for the presidency Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, according to multiple reports. Kasich had planned to hold a press conference at Dulles Aiport near Washington Wednesday morning, but he never took off—perhaps an apt metaphor—staying home and scheduling a press conference for 5 p.m., where he is expected to make his announcement."
"“Lock her up, lock her up.”
Donald Trump’s supporters lobbed this rallying cry at Hillary Clinton in 2016 — hoping for the imprisonment of a political opponent for allegedly mishandling classified material. Now, however, some of the same people appear to believe that even a rule-of-law investigation of Mr. Trump for a possible violation of the same set of rules is out of order.
The FBI executed a search warrant at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida this week as part of what The Post reports is an investigation into the potential..."
"Fresh from his own re-election victory and his party’s powerful showing nationwide, Senator Mitch McConnell on Wednesday pledged to break the stalemate in Washington as newly empowered congressional Republicans moved quickly to demonstrate that they can get things done. “We’re going to pass legislation,” Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Louisville, Ky. “This gridlock and dysfunction can be ended.”
Despite their new majority in the Senate and an expanded one in the House, Republicans face multiple difficulties, not the least of which are internal divisions. But t"
"U.S. consumer prices soared last year by the most in nearly four decades, illustrating red-hot inflation that sets the stage for the start of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes as soon as March. 
The consumer price index climbed 7% in 2021, the largest 12-month gain since June 1982, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.5% from November, exceeding forecasts.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices accelerated from a month earlier, rising by a larger-than-forecast 0.6%. The measure jumped 5.5% from..."
"The Justice Department announced Friday that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will not be charged following an allegation by the department's inspector general that he lied to investigators about a leak to the media.
In a letter to McCabe's attorneys, the department said that ""based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the government at this time, we consider the matter closed.""
The decision is not likely to sit well with President Trump."
"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Justice is dropping its criminal investigation of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe without bringing charges, it announced on Friday.
McCabe's attorneys received a phone call and a letter from the US Attorney's Office in DC on Friday announcing the declination.

"President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Antony Blinken for the coveted secretary of state post, a source familiar with the transition discussions told NPR.
Blinken, 58, has extensive foreign policy experience, serving as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser under President Obama.
A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School, Blinken began his foreign policy career during the Clinton administration. He worked as Democratic staff director for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2002-2008, where he worked closely with Biden. He went on to serve as..."
"President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate longtime adviser and veteran foreign policy hand Antony Blinken to serve as his secretary of State, while picking another confidant, Jake Sullivan, for the role of national security adviser, according to three people familiar with the issue.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a veteran diplomat, will be nominated to serve as Biden’s ambassador to the United Nations, according to two people familiar with the nomination discussions.
The choices would put three highly experienced officials at the helm of U.S. foreign policy. Even some notable conservative voices praised..."
"Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III announced Wednesday he was closing his office and offered his first public comments on the results of his work, asserting that Justice Department legal guidance prevented him from accusing the president of a crime and noting cryptically that the Constitution “requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”
Standing alone on stage in a room on the Justice Department’s seventh floor normally used for press conferences, Mueller said he was “speaking out today because our investigation..."
"We should have known, I guess, that it wasn’t going to be that easy. The woman one third of America thinks is probably a murderer just wasn’t going to waltz her way into the White House, even against Donald Trump. And now, after what FBI director James Comey did Friday, we know that Hillary Clinton is going to have to dig down deeper than she ever has and fight like she never has."
"The FBI shocked the political world on Friday by announcing that newly discovered emails have caused the bureau to renew its inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.
The Clinton campaign has for months thought the worst of the email server controversy was over. In July, to their great relief, FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton would not face criminal charge"
"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday there will be riots if former President Donald Trump is prosecuted over his handling of classified materials.
Graham made the comment in an appearance on Fox News' ""Sunday Night in America."" The South Carolina senator said he thinks there's a ""double standard"" when it comes to federal law enforcement, citing recent comments made by Mark Zuckerberg about Meta's handling of a story about Hunter Biden's laptop after an FBI warning.

"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump signed a bill that makes animal cruelty a federal felony on Monday, saying the measure would help us be ""more responsible and humane stewards of our planet.""
The PACT Act -- which stands for Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture -- was signed by the President at the White House, where he said he was ""pleased"" to approve the legislation. The bipartisan act, which passed the Senate earlier this month, expands a previous law passed in 2010.
Trump said he had the same reaction to the..."
"Cruelty to animals is now a federal crime under a new law signed by President Trump on Monday.
The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act (PACT) is a bipartisan initiative that bans the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impalement or other serious harm to ""living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians.""
The law also bans ""animal crush videos,"" meaning any photograph, motion picture film, video or digital recording or electronic image that depicts animal cruelty."
"By this time next week this will be official: Joe Biden is making his third race for the presidency (earlier runs were in 1988 and 2008). In conventional terms, he begins his campaign as the front-runner, or at worst the co-front-runner with fellow mid-septuagenarian Bernie Sanders. He has led in 36 of the 37 polls included in RealClearPolitics’ compilation of 2020 Democratic-nomination-contest surveys. He also leads in all the publicly available polls of Iowa, and even leads in Kamala Harris’s California.
But the big question haunting his candidacy now is..."
"James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., may have relieved Hillary Clinton of a legal burden on Tuesday, but he left her with a substantial political one. While announcing that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton for her handling of classified material on nonsecure personal email servers, Mr. Comey issued a strong rebuke of her practices, which he called “extremely careless” — and for which she has never given the public a full explanation. He was right on both points."
"A trove of court documents unsealed Thursday night appear to show that the late, accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was in contact with his now-charged confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2015.
Attorneys for Maxwell, who was arrested July 2, have argued that she hadn't had any contact with Epstein for more than a decade, and is the target of overzealous prosecutors.
In one email between Epstein and Maxwell in 2015, Epstein appears to be composing a draft statement for Maxwell to release publicly. The date in January 2015 is a few..."
"A federal judge has unsealed hundreds of pages of deposition transcripts and other documents related to a now-settled defamation suit brought against Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of helping the late Jeffrey Epstein run a sex trafficking operation that catered to rich and powerful men.
The 47 documents include a deposition given by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, the draft of a memoir she was writing about her experiences inside the sex-trafficking ring, and previously unseen email exchanges between Maxwell and Epstein.
A centerpiece of the documents remains sealed: Ghislaine..."
"WASHINGTON–Federal prosecutors recommended Tuesday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn serve up to six months in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian ambassador.
The government's position is a reversal from more than a year ago, when prosecutors urged no prison time for the retired Army lieutenant general. Flynn is one of a half-dozen former aides to President Donald Trump who were convicted or pleaded guilty due to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election."
"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn should serve up to six months in jail, prosecutors told a federal judge on Tuesday, saying Flynn has failed to accept responsibility for his actions and undermined a separate criminal case.
The sentencing memo shows just how harshly the Justice Department responds to Flynn's recent attempts to unravel his guilty plea in the Mueller investigation and says that he sought to thwart the government's investigation into his former business partner, an abrupt turn from Flynn's months of cooperation and public..."
"Forget about The Grinch: It looks like supply chain disruptions may steal Christmas this year. But will these problems be resolved by early 2022?
Several retailers, manufacturers and economists have all warned that global supply chain constraints will lead to not only fewer discounts during the holidays but also result in a potential dearth of products on store shelves.
Still, some executives and market experts think the worst may be over in just a few months.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said during an earnings call with reporters last week that supply chain woes will be a distant..."
"The Electoral College elected Joe Biden as the next president Monday, formalizing the former Democratic vice president's win in the Nov. 3 election as President Donald Trump continues a long-shot effort to try to overturn the outcome.
Around 5:30 p.m. EST, California's 55 electors cast their ballots to push Biden over the 270-vote threshold needed to win.
Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, the vice president-elect, received 306 electoral votes overall, topping Trump’s 232 votes. Next, the electoral votes will be counted at a special joint session of Congress on..."
"It began at 10 a.m. in New Hampshire, where electors met in a statehouse chamber festooned with holiday decorations and gave their four votes to Joseph R. Biden Jr. By noon on Monday, the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, ground zero for many of President Trump’s fruitless lawsuits, had backed Mr. Biden too. In New York, Bill and Hillary Clinton voted for Mr. Biden along with 27 other electors.
And when California cast its 55 votes for Mr. Biden around 5:30 p.m. Eastern time, it pushed him past..."

"Casualties are mounting in Ukraine. Bombs continue to fall. More than 2 million refugees have fled the fighting.
Vladimir Putin seems to have assumed he could get a swift victory, underestimating the fierce resistance from Ukraine. Two weeks in, Russia is intensifying its assault on Ukraine, and Western nations in turn are intensifying their financial and economic punishments against Russia, including by triggering the financial “nuclear option” — banning some Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin has put his actual nuclear forces on high alert.

"There were many memorable lines, and even a few revelations, in the long-awaited House select committee prime-time hearing on the harrowing events of January 6, 2021. Viewers on Thursday night learned that Donald Trump’s own Attorney General, Bill Barr, had dismissed his “rigged election” claims as “bullshit.” They learned that Trump’s own daughter Ivanka agreed with Barr. And they learned that Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, had been informed of the complete and utter emptiness of Trump’s false election claims by one of Trump’s own campaign lawyers. “There’s no there there?” Meadows..."
"NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime, the FBI concluded Tuesday after completing its investigation into an incident involving a noose in the garage stall of the top-flight Cup Series’ only African American driver.
After 48 hours that rattled and then galvanized stock-car racing at a fraught moment for the sport and the nation, the FBI said no federal charges would be filed after it determined that the noose had been there since at least October 2019 and that “nobody could have known” that Wallace’s..."
"NASCAR went to Talladega Superspeedway on heightened alert after Bubba Wallace, its only Black driver, took on an active role in a push for racial equality.
Wallace had successfully called for the ban of the Confederate flag and received threats. Fans paraded past the main entrance of the Alabama track displaying the flag, and a plane circled above the speedway pulling a Confederate flag banner that read “Defund NASCAR.”"
"Top Latino Democrats are voicing growing concern about Joe Biden’s campaign, warning that lackluster efforts to win the support of their community could have devastating consequences in the November election.
Recent polls showing President Trump’s inroads with Latinos have set off a fresh round of frustration and finger-pointing among Democrats, confirming problems some say have simmered for months. Many Latino activists and officials said Biden is now playing catch-up, particularly in the pivotal state of Florida, where he will campaign Tuesday — the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month —..."
"In a south Phoenix strip mall near a Chinese restaurant and cell phone store, sits a new office designed to mobilize Latino voters and convince them to vote for President Donald Trump in November.
Outside the front doors, the words ""Latinos for Trump"" are written in chalk on the sidewalk.
The windows of Latinos for Trump are adorned with photos of Latinos and core values the Trump campaign believes will attract this group of voters: faith, family, opportunity.

"All 22 of Donald Trump’s endorsed candidates in Indiana and Ohio came away with the Republican nomination last week.
While his May 3 win-loss record looked impressive on paper, it was artificially inflated — the former president backed lots of incumbents who had no opposition and counted them as victories.
Trump did take one legit risk in endorsing J.D. Vance in the Ohio Senate primary. And his big gamble proved successful when Vance came from behind to finish in first place.
This week, Trump had slightly more political capital at..."
"President Barack Obama still doesn’t have a strategy to combat the Islamic State.
Back in September, Obama created a political problem for himself by saying “we don’t have a strategy yet” to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL.
Story Continued Below
On Monday, speaking at the end of a G-7 summit in Germany that included a meeting with the new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, he rearranged the words and added an adjective, but said the same thing about training Iraqi troops..."
"President Obama said on Monday that he has asked the Pentagon for a plan to accelerate the American military’s efforts to train and equip Iraqi forces fighting the Islamic State, acknowledging that the militant group’s recent gains indicated a need for a shift in strategy.
“We don’t have, yet, a complete strategy, because it requires commitments on the part of Iraqis as well,” Mr. Obama said at the close of a summit of the Group of 7 world leaders here. “The details are not worked out.”"
"President Trump met Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea on Sunday and crossed briefly into North Korea, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to visit the isolated state. The two men held 53 minutes of private talks and agreed to set up teams to “work out some details” to determine whether progress could be made in their negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program, Trump said."
"A federal judge ordered Texas to suspend the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S., calling it an “offensive deprivation” of a constitutional right by banning most abortions in the nation’s second-most populous state since September.
The order Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman is the first legal blow to the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which until now had withstood a wave of early challenges. In the weeks since the restrictions took effect, Texas abortion providers say the impact has been “exactly what we feared.”
In a 113-page opinion, Pitman took..."
"A federal judge in Texas issued an order Wednesday blocking the state's six-week abortion ban.
""From the moment S.B. 8 went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution,"" US District Judge Robert Pitman said in the decision, granting a request from the Justice Department, which brought the lawsuit.
""That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important..."
"President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Saudi Arabia and Russia appeared to be close to curbing their oil production, a potential lifeline for the U.S. oil sector that has been buffeted by plummeting energy demand from the coronavirus and a flood of crude exports from the two countries.
“Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens,..."
"President Donald Trump just dug himself in more deeply on the wrong side of history in the fast-changing consensus on the role and shame of racism in America. In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, Trump strongly opposed renaming the 10 U.S. Army bases that are named after Confederate officers. As he put it:
These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom. The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won..."
"The U.S., Iran and five world powers announced on Thursday that they have reached agreement on key elements of a preliminary deal on Iran’s nuclear program.
The agreement includes partial sanctions relief for the Islamic Republic if it is found in compliance with the deal, a more comprehensive, technical version of which is expected by June 30. It also includes several restrictions on Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, material that can be used either for energy production or in nuclear warheads, according to a statement by Federica Mogherini, the..."
"Negotiators from Iran and major world powers reached agreement Thursday on a framework for a final agreement to curb Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions, participants in the marathon talks said.
They said the sides, including the United States and its key European allies, would promptly start drafting a final accord to be completed by a June 30 deadline.

"Congressional Republicans seem to be gearing up to shoot themselves in the foot on health care, again (how nice for them that they don’t have to worry about their coverage). Despite last month’s Trumpcare disaster and the growing popularity of Obamacare, Republicans have kept working on zombie Trumpcare, and now they seem to think they have the next plan they’re going to fail with, thanks to a deal between House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows and Tuesday Group co-chair Tom MacArthur."
"Whether it was in the ring in his fights with Liston and Foreman, or in his defiance of the Vietnam draft and his public battle with Parkinson’s, Ali was the bravest of men. The tributes paid since his death was announced on Saturday have confirmed that for more than half a century Muhammad Ali was many things to many people in many lands. But if there was one quality that ran through his life like an unbroken thread, it was his bravery.
Bravery is one of those ancient virtues that..."
"At a time when Muslims in America are facing scorn and bigotry, the late boxing legend Muhammad Ali should be remembered as the true, peaceful face of Islam, residents of his home town say.
Hundreds of people filed past his childhood home in Louisville on Sunday, now a museum dedicated to his remarkable life, to honour the three-time heavyweight champion known simply as ""The Greatest"".
Mourners left flowers and other mementos remembered his sporting prowess and his activism, but also spoke of Ali and his Muslim faith and how his..."
"Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee in New York’s governor race, was attacked during a campaign event in the town of Perinton, southeast of Rochester, on Thursday night.
As Zeldin was giving a speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a man got on stage holding something in his hand, according to News 8 WROC.
Spectrum News reporter Nick Reisman obtained a witness’ video of the moment which shows a man wearing a hat approaching Zeldin, and appears to grab him by the arms as other people attempt to intervene. Zeldin,..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Tuesday that it will take up the question of whether a for-profit company can refuse to cover contraception for its employees because of religious objections.
Dozens of companies have sued the Obama administration over a rule in the Affordable Care Act requiring most employers -- with the exception of churches and religious non-profits -- to cover the full range of contraceptives in their health insurance plans. The Supreme Court will hear the most high-profile case, filed by the Christian-owned craft supply chain Hobby Lobby,..."
"In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative.
The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party — Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner — and it has the potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections."
"It wasn’t enough that Eric Cantor spent $1 million in the weeks leading up to the election, when his primary opponent hardly had $100,000 in his campaign coffers.
It didn’t matter that the House majority leader, 51, branded Dave Brat a liberal hack, and himself as the guardian of the Republican creed. On Tuesday night, Cantor, who was swept into the majority leader’s suite in a tea party wave, was swept out by the same movement."
"President Trump's executive order on immigration late Friday ignited nationwide protests — and a slew of legal challenges.
At least four federal judges across the country have blocked part of the order and temporarily ensured refugees and travelers who reached U.S. soil would not be deported.
Here's an explanation of what happened so far and what could come next."
"It is not out of the question that Donald Trump could sweep all five states that vote on this second Super Tuesday: Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois. But a split decision of some kind seems more likely. John Kasich is closing strong and considered the favorite to prevail in his home state."
"The Covid-19 pandemic has loomed large over the Tokyo Olympics ever since last year's postponement, shaping a Games the like of which has never been seen before.
When the opening ceremony gets underway on Friday, it will put an end to months of speculation over whether the Olympics would be even able to go ahead, as well as prompting further questions about how Covid-19 could shape the weeks to come.
Tokyo 2020 will host about 11,000 athletes -- representing more than 200 countries -- and they will be staying in 21 residential buildings.

"Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, suggested Saturday that he might release his tax returns before Election Day, even as his running mate has shown no inclination of doing the same.
Breaking with campaign custom, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, has refused to release his returns. On Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, made public their own 2015 returns, while pointedly noting that Mr. Trump had not."
"Chris Christie won't say how long he'll spend as governor of New Jersey.
The newly re-elected governor said his focus is on his home state, but acknowledged he could prematurely leave the governor’s mansion to pursue his presidential ambitions.
When ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked Christie if he expected to serve all four years of his term as governor, Christie sidestepped the question."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) shrugged off the suggestion that he's not conservative enough to win the Republican presidential nomination on Sunday and stood by his belief that gun control can be a necessary part of violence prevention.
""If you look at what we've done in New Jersey, we want to control violence,"" Christie told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. ""And some of that may involve firearms, but a lot of it doesn't."""

"News of the Ukrainian army’s recent advances swept across western capitals like fresh air. A war that was for months mired in crushing artillery fire had suddenly opened up. Russian forces, outmaneuvered by the Ukrainian army, fled, again proving weaker than anyone expected. Hopes lifted that Ukraine could win the war and force their tormentor back to the prewar battlelines – and perhaps further.
Russia shared the same assessment. Vladimir Putin knows his military is badly damaged and getting weaker. The Russian president responded with military mobilization and preparations to..."

But despite Being Fewer than half of the States, back-of-the-envelope Calculations suggest that just about half of the US gay population lives in a state that allows gay marriage.

"The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday at the forefront of the national political conversation, but with its future uncertain and the unwelcome prospect of deciding a divisive presidential election on the horizon.
With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the bench still draped in black crepe, the eight remaining justices will gather via teleconference to tackle a docket that, for now, is not nearly as controversial as the last.
That term saw the court strike a restrictive state abortion law, decide LGBTQ workers are protected by federal anti-discrimination..."
"Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski announced Wednesday that she will support the Iran nuclear agreement, giving the White House the final vote needed to protect the accord from a Republican-led effort to defeat the measure.
With her endorsement, Mikulski became the crucial 34th vote needed to sustain President Obama's expected veto should Congress pass a measure to block the agreement."
"A nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers that promises to fundamentally alter the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and beyond will not die in the U.S. Congress.
On Wednesday, Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) announced that she would support the agreement, becoming the 34th member of the Senate to do so. In offering her backing, Mikulski, who is retiring in 2016, assured that President Barack Obama will dodge a Republican-led effort to kill the deal. Although a resolution of disapproval may still pass the chamber, the White House..."
"A team of international scientists tasked with understanding how the coronavirus pandemic began released their first report on Thursday, saying that all hypothesis remain on the table, including a possible laboratory incident.
The 27-member scientific advisory group convened by the World Health Organization said available data suggests the virus jumped from animals to humans but gaps in ""key pieces of data"" meant a complete understanding of the pandemic's origins could not be established.
The team, called the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), was formed last year to..."
"Since its inception, Facebook’s user growth has essentially been up and to the right. But on Wednesday, it reported its first-ever quarterly decline of daily users globally, along with lower-than-expected ad growth that sent its stock plunging roughly 20 percent.
The massive stock drop, which instantly wiped out roughly $200 billion in market value, shows that Facebook’s corporate rebrand to Meta isn’t enough to distract investors from the problems in its core business of social media. Not only was user growth across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp essentially flat last quarter, but the..."
"Trump’s attorney general just took a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to the president’s ongoing and bizarre election conspiracy theories.
There’s simply no evidence to back up Trump’s assertion that the election was stolen from him, Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press in an interview published Tuesday.
“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,” Barr told the AP.
Barr told the agency that federal prosecutors and FBI agents have been following up specific..."

The group struck a deal with Democrats on Sunday that could lead to more spending on mental health care, school security, extra scrutiny of young gun buyers and incentives to states to temporarily confiscate weapons from those deemed a threat.
Critically, the size of the group of senators brings the promise of overcoming the Senate filibuster, the procedural block requiring 60 votes that has allowed..."
"More migrants are coming to the US-Mexico border, and officials say they expect the number to grow.
This is something we've seen many times before. But some key details are different this time around.
Here's a look at what's changing, why it's happening now and why it matters.
There's a huge backlog of migrants waiting to cross
For two years, a pandemic public health order has been in place that stopped many migrants from crossing the border and seeking asylum in the United States. The policy is known as Title..."
"Steve Mnuchin says the final decision on the release of Trump’s tax returns is coming next month.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin left little doubt Tuesday that the administration will reject a congressional request for President Donald Trump's tax returns by a self-imposed May 6 target for a ""final decision,"" setting the stage for a legal battle that will test the limits of congressional oversight.
In a 10-page letter to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who formally requested Trump's returns on April 3, Mnuchin questioned Neal's motives and..."
"The Trump administration on Friday announced $13 billion in additional aid to Puerto Rico to help with rebuilding in the aftermath of 2017's Hurricane Maria.
Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced tweeted Friday morning that Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Pete Gaynor told her that $13 billion has been approved. She thanked the White House and President Donald Trump.
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany touted the $13 billion FEMA award as two of the agency's ""largest grants ever"" in a statement. It will include a $11.6 billion federal..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday there could be no action on a stand-alone bill to aid airlines or any other sector of the economy without an agreement with the White House and Republicans on a broader economic stimulus package.
Her remarks suggested that there would be no quick relief for airlines or resolution of the standoff over aiding the U.S. economy, even as there are signs the recovery could weaken without further stimulus.
Pelosi has rebuffed President Donald Trump’s called for Congress to pass relief legislation piecemeal, though she..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden backtracked on his earlier position that he would not comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. On Saturday evening, he gave the clearest answer on the issue at a town hall in Fairfield, Iowa by seemingly changing his mind on something he had declared earlier in the day. “Well, first of all, I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” he said in answer to a question from an audience member on the issue. “But the point..."
"“Do you make $75,000 or less? Democrats’ new army of 87,000 IRS agents will be coming for you — with 710,000 new audits for Americans who earn less than $75k.”
— House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in a tweet, Aug. 9
With a vote scheduled Friday in the House on the big spending package approved in the Senate, the GOP has focused its fire on provisions that would bolster the Internal Revenue Service with new funding to crack down on tax cheats.
But these numbers are a misfire, lacking significant context...."
"Attorney General Eric Holder has for the first time directed Justice Department employees to give same-sex married couples ""full and equal recognition, to the greatest extent under the law,"" a move with far-ranging consequences for how such couples are treated in federal courtrooms and proceedings.
The directive specifies that such couples can decline to give testimony in U.S. cases that might incriminate a spouse, kn"
"The federal government will soon treat married same-sex couples the same as heterosexual couples when they file for bankruptcy, testify in court or visit family in prison.
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was preparing to issue policies aimed at eliminating the distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex married couples in the federal criminal justice system, according to a speech given at a Saturday event organized by a prominent gay-rights group.

"The U.S. for the first time Friday said it will give Ukraine Scan Eagle surveillance drones, mine-resistant vehicles, anti-armor rounds and howitzer weapons to help Ukrainian forces regain territory and mount a counteroffensive against Russian invaders.
A senior defense official told reporters that a new $775 million aid package will include 15 Scan Eagles, 40 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles known as MRAPs with mine-clearing rollers, and 2,000 anti-armor rounds that can help Ukraine troops move forward in the south and east, where Russian forces have placed mines. The official said the U.S...."
"WASHINGTON — Just weeks after the coronavirus overwhelmed hospitals in and around New York City, medical centers in Arizona, Florida, Texas and other states with skyrocketing infections are rapidly filling with sick patients, threatening state healthcare systems.
The swift increase has forced hospital leaders to begin bringing in extra staff, converting space into dedicated coronavirus units and, in some cases, moving sick patients hundreds of miles to get to available beds.
Surging numbers of patients with COVID-19 — though still shy of the wave that hit New York —..."
"Texas and Florida clamped down on bars again Friday in the biggest retreat yet amid a surge across the South and West that sent the number of confirmed new coronavirus infections per day in the U.S. to an all-time high of 40,000.

Together the two states joined the small but growing list of those that are either backtracking or putting any further reopenings of their economies on hold because of comeback by the..."
"In the mythology that holds sway over President Trump’s political imagination, the massive crises rocking the country — pandemic, depression, the worst civil unrest in 50 years — are all being alchemized by Trump’s magical reality-bending powers into political gold.
Trump has hoped to use these events to solidify his grip on his base, by vowing to protect Trump country from a disease ravaging urban America, by harnessing the supposed populist rage of Real American workers against Democratic elites locking down economies, and by repurposing “law and order” race-baiting to..."
"President Donald Trump lashed out at CNN on Monday after the network released a poll that showed his job approval rating dropped 7 percentage points in one month.
The poll released Monday, conducted from June 2-5, found Trump's approval rating had sunk to 38% – its lowest level since January 2019 – and his disapproval rating had climbed to 57%. A CNN poll conducted from May 7-10 found 45% of Americans approved of the job Trump has done as president, while 51% disapproved."

"Dr. Anthony Fauci got a bit snarky towards one of his loudest Republican critics on Sunday, firing back at Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s demand that Attorney General Merrick Garland prosecute the nation’s top infectious disease expert. During a wide-ranging sit-down with CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan, Fauci dismissed the political “theater” coming from GOP lawmakers such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who has called for Fauci to be arrested while accusing him of being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Brennan then noted that Cruz told the attorney general to prosecute Fauci, prompting the..."
"Minnesota officials said the police officer who fatally shot a Black man at a traffic stop did so accidentally, and meant to fire a Taser instead.
A 20-year-old Black man died after a police officer shot him during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb on Sunday, sending hundreds of people into the streets where they clashed with police officers into Monday morning.
The protests in Brooklyn Center came hours before the 11th day of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with..."
"The police officer who fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb apparently intended to fire a Taser, not a handgun, as the man struggled with police, the city’s police chief said Monday.
Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon described the shooting as “an accidental discharge.” It happened as police were trying to arrest the man on an outstanding warrant.
“I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” the officer is heard shouting on her body cam footage released at a news conference. She..."
"President Biden will hold his first press conference as president on March 25, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. The news comes after questions from reporters and urging from critics that he do so.
By this point in their presidencies, former Presidents Trump and Obama had held some form of a press conference. When Mr. Biden holds his first press conference, he's sure to face questions on the situation at the southern border, the possibility of an infrastructure package, vaccines and more.
Mr. Biden has taken shouted..."
"Senators Tammy Duckworth and Mazie Hirono on Tuesday backed off their threat to vote against any of President Joe Biden's nominees who aren't minorities, after going public with their anger that the Cabinet lacks Asian Americans, and Duckworth earlier saying she felt insulted by the White House's attempts to brush off her concerns.
The move came after a tense Monday exchange between Duckworth and a top Biden aide, followed by a series of conversations Tuesday and ultimately a decision by the White House to install a senior-level aide responsive to..."
"Senator Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., had told reporters Tuesday she would not support any more of President Joe Biden's nondiverse nominees until he appoints more Asian Americans to his Cabinet.
But she, and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, dropped that ultimatum late Tuesday after multiple conversations with White House officials and agreement about representation.
Biden's Cabinet — which is shaping up to be the most diverse in U.S. history – does not include a Cabinet secretary of Asian American or Pacific Islander descent. Every presidential Cabinet since 2000 has included an Asian..."
"Millions of voters across the country will cast ballots during Super Tuesday on old, insecure election equipment — even after nearly four years of handwringing and warnings about Russian election interference.
The jurisdictions at risk include three of Tennessee’s biggest counties — Shelby, Knox and Rutherford — where the paperless voting machines at the polls will include devices with security flaws so alarming that voters tried suing to have the equipment removed from precincts. Dozens of small counties in Texas are also sticking with risky touchscreen machines that have no..."

"Ukraine evacuated residents from a besieged city Tuesday along the first safe corridor established with Russia since Moscow invaded its democratic neighbor nearly two weeks ago, sparking a humanitarian crisis and an exodus of refugees that has now reached 2 million.
The Russian assault has stalled on the ground but brought increasing devastation from the air, leaving cities from Mariupol in the southeast to Sumy further north encircled and without heat, electricity, water and food.
The two countries agreed to a cease-fire in Sumy early Tuesday to let civilians escape the northeastern city after another night..."
"Buses carried civilians out of one embattled Ukrainian city Tuesday and supplies toward another, as officials tried to move people away from a Russian onslaught and ease the dire humanitarian situation for those still stuck. But reports of renewed Russian attacks on the port of Mariupol threatened to again derail the efforts.
On the 13th day of the invasion, Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War II grew even more severe, with U.N. officials reporting that 2 million people have now fled Ukraine.
Demands for ways to safely evacuate civilians have surged along with intensifying shelling..."
"Post-flyby images from NASA's New Horizons probe show Pluto is a surprisingly active world in the deep freeze of the outer solar system, with jagged 11,000-foot-high mountains of frozen water dusted with a veneer of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide ice amid smooth plains and jumbled terrain that defies easy explanation, scientists reported Wednesday.
A distinct paucity of impact craters implies processes at work now or in the geologically recent past that have resurfaced large areas of Pluto, smoothing out the pockmarks so familiar on other small bodies. What powers..."
"Monica Lewinsky is taking to the pages of Vanity Fair to address her affair with former President Bill Clinton, writing that she avoided the spotlight for fear of becoming an issue during Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, but adding that the time has come to stop “tiptoeing around my past — and other people’s futures.”"
"The House Republican leadership is reaching out to top House Democrats to assess their support for a piecemeal approach to immigration reform, according to sources involved in the discussions.
The House’s immigration gameplan is to pass individual bills rather than take the comprehensive approach advocated by the Senate. Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) team isn’t trying to cut a deal with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), these aides caution. But deeply-divided Republicans want to get a read on what members of the minority party would back when immigration reform comes..."
"Immigration reform entered an uncertain new phase on Wednesday as House Republicans signaled some willingness to compromise with President Barack Obama and Democrats but rejected a Senate-passed bill and insisted they would take their time drafting their own version.
Following more than two hours of talks on how to proceed, GOP legislators said the biggest question was whether to give the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States a path to eventual citizenship, as provided by the Senate measure."
"According to the Republican nominee for president, his opponents were ""on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history."" In an ad, his campaign warned of ""nationwide voter fraud"" that could swing the election. His running mate worried, in a fundraising letter, that ""leftist groups"" were trying to ""steal the election."""
"President Obama set the tone for his second term Tuesday, going through a litany of policy proposals that he will pursue in the months and years ahead.
And polls suggest most of his big proposals have broad public support.
That doesnt mean, of course, that Congress will pass the bills, but it does suggest that the president is pushing ideas that the American public is broadly receptive to."
"It is sometimes said of a great actor that he could hold an audience spellbound while reading a laundry list. This is essentially what President Obama tried to do on Tuesday night. As State of the Union addresses go, his was artless. It lacked inspired phrases or compelling narrative. Save for the energy he gave it at key moments, it was pedestrian."
"The mutually beneficial campaign detente between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) came to an end on the debate stage here Thursday.
The two Republican presidential candidates, locked in a tight race to win the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, argued over whether Cruz meets the constitutional requirements to serve as president and whether Trump is a trustworthy conservative or is tainted by what Cruz called “New York values.”
Theirs was far from the only battle that broke out in the sixth GOP debate of the 2016 campaign season. Sen...."

"Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer and fixer, says he is being forced to take responsibility for Trump's ""dirty deeds."" In an interview with ABC News, Cohen says that during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump directed him to arrange hush-money payments to two women and that the candidate knew it was illegal."
"Americans are again battling over history.
Is the year 1619 as important as 1776? Shall we tear down statues of Robert E. Lee — or go further and topple Thomas Jefferson too? Is the left telling a “twisted web of lies” (as President Trump put it) about America’s “magnificent” history, or was the U.S. indeed built on a rotten foundation of genocide, disenfranchisement, bigotry and oppression?
Angry debates have spread from social media to school board meetings to state capitols to the White House, as Americans haggle over who we..."
"Once upon a time there was a cable news network that nobody liked. Nobody except the loons, that is: those very special people who willfully eschew logical reasoning and the established corpus of knowledge in favor of febrile theories, weird cultural grievances, and other made-up bullshit. As luck would have it, there were enough loons out there for the network to be aired by many cable providers, and to reap millions of dollars in carriage fees year after year after year. Then, in a shocking development, one of America’s foremost..."
"Two Capitol Hill panels that police the ethics of members of Congress appear to be battling about which has authority over 10 lawmakers accused of unwittingly accepting improper travel and gifts from the state oil company of Azerbaijan.
A Washington Post story published Wednesday detailed the contents of a confidential Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation of a 2013 trip to Azerbaijan, a former republic of the Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The OCE was created in 2008 to vet ethics cases and recommend action to the Ethics Committee. The..."
"The state-owned oil company of Azerbaijan secretly funded an all-expenses-paid trip to a conference in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in 2013 for 10 members of Congress and 32 staff members, according to a confidential ethics report obtained by The Washington Post. Three former top aides to President Obama appeared as speakers at the event.
Lawmakers and their staff members received hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of travel expenses, silk scarves, crystal tea sets and Azerbaijani rugs valued at $2,500 to $10,000, according to the ethics report. Airfare for..."
"Amid the latest COVID-19 resurgence sweeping the nation, some top health officials are asking Americans to wear face masks again in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
Officials such as White House COVID-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky have repeatedly encouraged jurisdictions to use the CDC’s community level COVID-19 map, which seeks to identify the risk level of COVID-19 in communities across the country, to help them decide if they should reimplement mitigation measures.

"French voters on Sunday rejected the two political parties that dominated France’s post-World War II political life, pitting an anti-immigrant firebrand against an unconventional centrist in a presidential election that could determine the future of the European Union and France’s place in the world."
"For President Trump, it may have been the best day of his tenure so far. The darkest, most ominous cloud hanging over his presidency was all but lifted on Sunday with the release of the special counsel’s conclusions, which undercut the threat of impeachment and provided him with a powerful boost for the final 22 months of his term.
There are still other clouds overhead and no one outside the Justice Department has actually read the report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, which may yet disclose damning..."
"Special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation in large part has defined the first half of President Trump's tenure, was spied in front of the White House on Sunday morning as he and his wife walked across Lafayette Square toward St. John's Episcopal Church.
The former FBI director looked, finally, relaxed.
That wasn't exactly the impact his long-awaited and confidential report had on the rest of official Washington. On a balmy spring Sunday, as Attorney General William Barr delivered the ""principal conclusions"" of the report to Congress, Republicans declared the president..."
"Congress averted a catastrophic debt default early Wednesday morning after Democratic majorities in both chambers voted to send a $2.5 trillion increase in the nation’s borrowing authority to President Joe Biden over lockstep Republican opposition.
Capping a marathon day, the House gave final approval to the legislation early Wednesday morning on a near-party-line 221-209 vote, defusing a volatile issue until after the 2022 midterm elections. The action came just hours shy of a deadline set by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who warned last month that she was running out of..."
"Lawmakers in the House have agreed to a deal that will allow the federal government to avoid defaulting on its loans until early 2023.
The House voted 221 to 209 Wednesday to increase the federal borrowing limit by $2.5 trillion.
NPR's Kelsey Snell reports the vote was mostly along party lines; Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois was the only Republican to join Democrats in voting to approve the measure. Pushing the deadline to 2023 likely means whatever party controls Congress after the 2022 midterm elections will decide how to address the..."
"Democrats are well-positioned, according to early voting data and sparse polling, but Republicans could win with strong Election Day turnout.
The most tightly divided state in the nation will decide on Tuesday which party controls the Senate — and in true 2020 fashion, we might not know who won on election night.
All signs point to a photo finish in Georgia’s twin Senate runoffs, two months after President-elect Joe Biden carried the state by two-tenths of a percentage point. The limited polling slightly favors Democrats, but most surveys are well..."
"Georgia voters head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate, marking the end of the tumultuous 2020 election cycle that saw Republicans make gains in Congress while losing the White House.
The elections are being held as President Donald Trump continues to allege without evidence that widespread voter fraud in Georgia caused his loss to Joe Biden on Nov. 3. Republicans are worried those claims – punctuated by Trump's extraordinary phone call Saturday when he tried to pressure GOP..."
"Twenty-one years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, Americans across the political spectrum share many of the same feelings when it comes to their memories and sentiments related to the attacks. 
However, younger adults demonstrate less connection to the event — and the feelings of unity that many Americans felt following the attacks — than their older counterparts, according to a new poll by nonprofit More In Common and research firm YouGov.
The poll also found nuance in American attitudes related to patriotism, safety and Islamophobia following the..."
"It may not be a pardon. But the Justice Department has dropped charges against Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
Retired Army Lt. Gen. Flynn, an important figure in the war on terror who gave Trump’s 2016 run military validation, will avoid prison time after the Justice Department provided a deliverance on Thursday that Flynn had long sought. It is also the second redemption that Trump has provided the general, who served as his first national security adviser for less..."
"Under sustained pressure from Donald Trump, the Justice Department took the highly unusual step of dropping its prosecution of Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, even though he had pleaded guilty more than two years ago to lying to FBI agents.
The move was disclosed in a court filing on Thursday shortly after the career prosecutor in charge of the case withdrew without explanation. Attorney General William Barr publicly backed the decision, which came after weeks of demands by Trump and his allies to redress what the president..."
"Police firing tear gas after an Indonesian soccer match in an attempt to stop violence triggered a disastrous crush of fans making a panicked, chaotic run for the exits, leaving at least 125 people dead, most of them trampled upon or suffocated.
Attention immediately focused on police crowd-control measures at Saturday night’s match between host Arema FC of East Java’s Malang city and Persebaya Surabaya. Witnesses described officers beating them with sticks and shields before shooting tear gas canisters directly into the crowds.
It was among the deadliest disasters ever..."
"President Joe Biden reveled in his party’s success on Wednesday, declaring it a good day for democracy and “a good day for America.”
His comments came after Democrats defied expectations of a red wave washing across the country and exceeded their most optimistic predictions about the midterms.
“Our democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are,” he said after walking into the State Dining Room to address reporters.

"For the fifth time, the U.S. Supreme Court has sided with religious adherents and against California's COVID-19 restrictions. This time, the court barred the state from enforcing a rule that for now limits both religious and non-religious gatherings in homes to no more than three households.
The court's unsigned order came on a 5-4 vote. Chief Justice John Roberts cast his lot with the dissenters, but failed to join their opinion. He noted simply that he would have left the lower court order intact.
A panel of the 9th Circuit..."
"In another late-night ruling, the Supreme Court on Friday blocked another California coronavirus restriction on religious gatherings, saying the state’s limits on home-based Bible study and prayer sessions violated constitutional rights.
The 5-to-4 order on an emergency petition illustrates how a new majority on the court — with Justice Amy Coney Barrett playing a decisive role — is now in control when the court considers if pandemic-related restrictions cross the line to endanger religious rights.
Constitutional protections are implicated any time a state treats “any comparable secular activity more favorably..."
"Asked by a reporter during Thursday’s White House press briefing what the president would say to parents who have kids in schools districts that are planning to go online-only in the fall, Kayleigh McEnany warned against using science to make decisions about the health of students, teachers, and families.

"Alabama sent the most restrictive abortion bill in the country to the governor's desk Tuesday night, with the state's Senate passing legislation that could punish doctors who perform abortions with life in prison.
The state's Republican backers have pushed the legislation, which amounts to a near-total ban on abortion in the state, forward with the express goal of overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case legalizing abortion. Alabama lawmakers join legislators in several other states in putting forth legislation to restrict abortion, such as Georgia's recent fetal heartbeat bill...."

"The top NSA official tasked with assessing the damage from Edward Snowden's leaks says he would consider amnesty for the former contractor in exchange for a halt to the flow of top secret information about U.S. spying.
Snowden, currently in Moscow evading a U.S. warrant for his arrest on espionage charges, leaked information on widespread data collection that's spurred outcry and forced President Barack Obama to review the spy agency's powers.

"SEATTLE — Faizel Khan was being told by the news media and his own mayor that the protests in his hometown were peaceful, with “a block party atmosphere.”
But that was not what he saw through the windows of his Seattle coffee shop. He saw encampments overtaking the sidewalks. He saw roving bands of masked protesters smashing windows and looting.
Young white men wielding guns would harangue customers as well as Mr. Khan, a gay man of Middle Eastern descent who moved here from Texas so he could more comfortably..."

"A New York judge ruled Tuesday that ExxonMobil did not make misleading statements in public disclosures about the company’s climate change risks, delivering a major win to the oil giant in the highly anticipated climate fraud case.
New York Supreme Court Judge Barry Ostrager found that the New York attorney general “failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence” that the oil giant violated the law “in connection with its public disclosures concerning how ExxonMobil accounted for past, present, and future climate change risks,” according to his decision.

"A judge has handed Exxon Mobil a victory in only the second climate change lawsuit to reach trial in the United States. The decision was a blow for the New York Attorney General's Office, which brought the case.
Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court said that the attorney general failed to prove that the oil giant broke the law.
""Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses in the production of its..."

"A federal judge in the United States ruled Saturday that former national security adviser John Bolton may proceed with the publication of his book despite efforts by the White House to block it on the grounds that secret information could be exposed.
Judge Royce Lamberth's decision is a victory for Bolton in a case that involved the constitutional right to free expression and national security reasons. But the judge also made clear that he was concerned that Bolton had ""played with the national security of the United States"" by not..."
"President Trump took a hard 180 from comments in his joint press conference Monday with Vladimir Putin where he said he believed Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 election. In a special presser Tuesday, Trump told reporters that he meant to say the opposite of what he'd said just a day earlier."
"Another day, another bombshell.
The ever-turbulent presidential race took another dramatic turn on Sunday afternoon as FBI Director James Comey revealed in a letter to Congress that newly-discovered messages would not affect his bureau’s decision that Hillary Clinton did not deserve prosecution — a revelation that comes a little more than a week after Comey first set the race into a frenzy."
"The New York Times has obtained video interviews and private group text messages recorded with the colleagues of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who was accused of war crimes, including murder. Gallagher was acquitted by a military jury in July of all but a single relatively minor charge, and was cleared of all punishment in November by President Trump. In one video of questioning by Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents, a SEAL broke the force’s self-imposed code of silence to describe Gallagher as “freaking evil,” while another says: “You could tell..."
"President Trump unloaded on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a heated cabinet meeting this week, railing against her for failing to stop illegal border crossings. Trump, who has growing increasingly frustrated by a spike in apprehensions at the border and other legal setbacks, blamed Nielsen Wednesday for failing to do enough to stop them, according to people familiar with the exchange."
"The Supreme Court opens its 2022 term on Oct. 3 with its lowest public approval rating in modern history, which the justices are acutely aware of. One reason is that the court issued some highly controversial decisions last term — most notably, the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.
But this is only part of the story.
Other important political officials have tarnished Americans’ opinions of the court, and public trust in democratic institutions and processes has dropped more generally as well.
That matters. With no independent enforcement power for their decisions, the justices rely on public respect for the court’s legitimacy. Yet..."
"The political war over President Obama's controversial policy changes on deportation escalated Friday as the White House pledged to forcefully sell the overhauls to the American people, while many Republicans vowed to derail his efforts.
Obama went to Nevada on Friday to begin what the White House described as a ""very aggressive"" effort to promote the changes but also to chide his Republican critics for opposing immigration reform.
""We're not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American dream,"" Obama said...."
"House Speaker John Boehner said Friday he has sued the Obama Administration in federal court over its decisions to make changes to the President's health care law, which congressional Republicans argue were unconstitutional.
The move was expected for months -- the GOP-controlled House of Representatives voted to approve the lawsuit in July. But Boehner had trouble retaining a law firm that would take the case because of the political furor over the controversial health care law.
""Time after time, the President has chosen to ignore the will of..."
"The House passed a resolution Tuesday to expel Confederate statues from the US Capitol and replace its bust of Roger B. Taney, the chief justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision, with one honoring Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice.
The vote was 285 to 120. Sixty-seven Republicans voted with 218 Democrats in support of the bill.
The House passed a similar resolution last year on a bipartisan basis but it stalled after Republicans in the Senate argued that the states should decide which statues they'd like to display in the..."
"With its aspirations for a quick victory dashed by a stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has increasingly focused on grinding down Ukraine’s military in the east in the hope of forcing Kyiv into surrendering part of the country’s territory to possibly end the war.
The bulk of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in eastern Ukraine, where it has been locked up in fighting with Moscow-backed separatists in a nearly eight-year conflict. If Russia succeeds in encircling and destroying the Ukrainian forces in the country’s industrial heartland called Donbas, it could try..."
"Just over a month after the first ballistic missiles slammed into Kyiv's international airport, the Russian campaign has been disrupted and derailed by stubborn Ukrainian resistance -- and in the last few days by agile Ukrainian counterattacks on several fronts.
Russian forces retain considerable -- but not overwhelming -- numerical superiority. Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of US-made Stinger missiles.
Poor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups..."
"South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott delivered the official Republican response to President Biden's address to Congress.
Scott, the lone Black GOP senator, spoke after Biden concluded his remarks Wednesday night.
When Scott was announced for the role, he said in a statement that he would be ""sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families."" In his address, he sought to offer an alternative to the Biden agenda while defending the GOP, and the nation at large, against charges of racism."
"The GOP, an increasingly extremist party whose members still can’t all admit that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, has a message for Joe Biden: Stop being so radical and divisive. That was the gist of Senator Tim Scott’s rebuttal to the president’s first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. Painting Biden’s calls for unity as “empty platitudes,” the South Carolina Republican accused Democrats of dividing Americans in pursuit of a far-left agenda, and of abandoning GOP lawmakers who sincerely want to come together to advance..."
"No member of the House has served as long as Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan. So it resonated when Mr. Dingell announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election to a seat he has held since the Eisenhower administration in part because the institution he once revered had become “obnoxious,” riven by acrimony and marked by lack of productivity.
“There is going to be a lot of blaming and finger-pointing back and forth, but all of us are at fault,” Mr. Dingell said in remarks to a..."
"A federal judge in California on Friday overturned the state’s three-decade-old ban on assault weapons, which he called a “failed experiment,” prompting a sharp retort from the state’s governor.
California prohibited the sale of assault weapons in 1989. The law was challenged in a suit filed in 2019 against the state’s attorney general by plaintiffs including James Miller, a California resident, and the San Diego County Gun Owners, a political action committee.
The judge, Roger T. Benitez of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, wrote that sections of the..."
"If it weren’t for a certain virus plaguing the world at this moment, more than half the American population — an estimated 57 percent — would be celebrating St. Patrick’s Day on Tuesday. Cabbage consumption would have increased by 70 percent; 13 million pints of Guinness would have been consumed; rivers would have been dyed green; 70 percent of revelers would have worn green; and an estimated $245 million would have been spent worldwide on beer — much of which would have, of course, been green.
As an Irish-born immigrant,..."
"After weeks of delay, the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, acknowledged on Tuesday that Joe Biden will be the next president, following an Electoral College vote that officially certified his win on Monday.
""The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,"" McConnell said Tuesday on the Senate floor, in a speech that heralded President Donald Trump's achievements.
Members of McConnell's leadership team also acknowledged the result.
""I was proud to join thousands of people in Wyoming in voting for President Trump. I..."
"The Justice Department told the Treasury Department that it ""must"" turn over former President Donald Trump's tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee, which first requested them more than two years ago.
The direction came in an opinion released Friday by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the executive branch.
""The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has invoked sufficient reasons for requesting the former President's tax information."" Under the department's interpretation of federal law, according to the opinion, ""Treasury must furnish..."
"In yet another unexpected and unwelcome twist in the pandemic, fully immunized people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant may spread the virus to others just as easily as unvaccinated people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report published on Friday.
The vaccines remain powerfully effective against severe illness and death, and infections in vaccinated people are thought to be comparatively rare. But the revelation follows a series of other findings this week about the Delta variant, all of which have upended scientists’ understanding of the..."
"The Obama administration announced on Friday a new accommodation for religious nonprofits that object to covering the full range of contraceptives in their employee health care plans.
The new accommodation will allow religious nonprofits, such as Catholic schools and hospitals, to opt out of covering birth control by notifying the Department of Health and Human Services of their objections. HHS and the Department of Labor will then arrange for a third-party insurer to pay for and administer the coverage for the nonpr"
"The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine remains 90% effective at reducing a person's risk of hospitalization from the virus six months after it is administered, a new study has found. This is true even in the face of the delta variant as well as if the person has not received a booster shot.
Still, when it comes to preventing infections, the vaccine's effectiveness wanes rapidly as time passes, the study found. After five months, it is just 47% effective at preventing infection.
In the study, funded by Pfizer, researchers assessed data from Kaiser Permanente and calculated the percentages..."
"At least nine protesters were arrested and five police officers injured during May Day clashes in Seattle where flares, bricks and Molotov cocktails were thrown, authorities said.
The anti-capitalist disorder followed a peaceful march earlier in the day by advocates for workers and immigrants — one of several nationwide events Sunday calling for better wages for workers and work permits for undocumented migrants.
One officer was struck by a rock, one was hit by a Molotov and a third was bitten, the Seattle Police Department said. The nature of the..."
"As thousands across the world rallied for workers and immigration rights in celebration of May Day, some protests in Seattle, Paris and Istanbul went from peaceful to violent as protesters clashed with police.
Anti-Capitalists In Seattle Turn Violent
In Seattle, Washington, what began as peaceful protests for immigration and workers rights turned ugly when anti-capitalist demonstrators began throwing rocks and bottles, the Seattle police department said.
Two Seattle police officers were injured and at least seven people arrested on Sunday after a group of unruly demonstrators hurled rocks,..."
"It was a stunning thing to say, even if it is in many ways true.
“They’re killing people,” President Biden said loudly enough to be heard under the roar of his Marine One helicopter idling on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday.
He was talking not about terrorists or leaders of rogue nations or even gun manufacturers. He was talking Silicon Valley tech moguls, most specifically people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the top two leaders of Facebook, and their platform’s role in allowing dangerous misinformation..."
"President Biden stressed Tuesday that his policy toward Taiwan had not changed, one day after forcefully pledging — as he has done before — that the United States would defend the island if it came under assault by neighboring China.
At a meeting here of leaders from the United States, India, Australia and Japan, Biden was asked to elaborate on his unequivocal remarks that were an apparent change to long-standing U.S. policy of deliberately staying unclear about what it would do in such a scenario, a principle known as “strategic..."
"Democratic surrogates in the cable TV spin rooms Wednesday night seemed to have trouble explaining President Barack Obama's weak debate performance. By Thursday morning, however, the Obama campaign had settled on a explanation for why their guy lost: Mitt Romney lied.
""On Wednesday night, some saw Mitt Romney sounding polished,"" a 4:15 AM press release conceded. ""But when the dust settles, Romney's dozen flat-out falsehoods will be the only thing remaining from his debate performance -- because avoiding the truth has been the very definition of Romney's candidacy, and he..."
"I have spent the past few days sequestered with a crack team of political pros — actually, curled into a fetal ball, clutching a fading 1980 John Anderson poster — to gird myself for the vital first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney.
So many questions lingered:
Would Romney offer to wager Obama $10,000 on who wins the race?
Would Obama tell Romney, ""You're taxable enough, Mitt""?
Would the two men reveal the secret handshake taught only to graduates of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School? (Didn't remember..."
"For weeks, a Russian invasion had been feared, but once the sweeping attacks began on Thursday, hitting seemingly every corner of Ukraine, the war became unavoidably tangible for its people, a hovering cloud of darkness that once seemed unimaginable in the post-Cold War era.
Hearing the booms of missile explosions and air attacks, and reports of battles that had killed both civilians and soldiers, some vowed to fight the intruders however they could. Most also realized, though, that life defying Russia’s overwhelming might was likely to be unsettled and treacherous.
In parts of Ukraine, people..."
"(CNN)Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday announced a plan to expand the use of deferred action immigration programs as president and use executive actions to remove the threat of deportation of millions of undocumented people in the United States.
The plan, which the California Democrat is rolling out ahead of a trip to Nevada on Friday, would work within the current confines of immigration law and assumes Congress would be unable to pass immigration reform, something the body has failed to do for years. Her plan, should she be elected in..."
"Well, it was a good idea while it lasted.
I’m referring to the removal of public monuments of known racists.
But the law—in that comfortable cradle of great virtue the world knows as Charlottesville, Va.,—has prevailed.
And it’s the celebration of racist business as usual.
On Wednesday, a judge in the fair, ahem, city ruled the controversial statues of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Stonewall Jackson must stay where they are.
This is a slap in the face to the February 2017 vote by the Charlottesville City..."
"A Virginia judge has blocked efforts to remove the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that was at the center of the deadly violence that erupted in Charlottesville in 2017.
In a ruling issued this week, Judge Richard E. Moore said that any effort to remove the Lee statue would violate a state historic preservation statute and issued a permanent injunction preventing its removal. His decision extended to a separate monument to Confederate general Stonewall Jackson that city leaders and local activists had hoped to get rid of.

"Floridians will save on items ranging from diapers and gasoline to auto racing tickets and energy efficient appliances under a $1 billion tax cut package signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday.
The tax cut includes a one-year sales tax exemption on diapers and baby clothes, as well as a three-month exemption on children’s books. It also eliminates sales tax on tickets for the Daytona 500, any World Cup soccer matches and Formula One Grand Prix races.
DeSantis signed the bill in Ocala in front of a..."
"Floridians will get more than $1.2 billion in tax breaks on a slew of items from diapers to mobile homes thanks to a bill Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Friday. 
As he prepared to sign the bill at a Sam's Club in Ocala, Florida, DeSantis blamed President Joe Biden for the state's need to provide financial relief amid record-high inflation. He has also warned in recent weeks that the country may be heading into a recession. 
""We have done more than any other state to step up against Bidenflation headwinds, to give relief..."
"Rush Limbaugh, the talk radio host who ripped into liberals and laid waste to political correctness with a merry brand of malice that made him one of the most powerful voices on the American right, influencing the rightward push of conservatism and the rise of Donald Trump, died Wednesday. He was 70.
Limbaugh said a year ago that he had lung cancer. His death was announced on his show by his wife, Kathryn.
Unflinchingly conservative, wildly partisan, bombastically self-promoting and larger than life, Limbaugh galvanized listeners for more than 30..."
"Rush Limbaugh, the talk titan who made right-wing radio financially viable in American media and himself a Republican kingmaker years before Fox News, died Wednesday, after he revealed in 2020 that his lung cancer was terminal. He was 70.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Kathryn, at the beginning of Limbaugh's radio show, from which he's been absent for almost two weeks.
A longtime cigar smoker who stocked the humidors in his homes and studios with the finest, Limbaugh succumbed to cancer after battling drug addiction and loss..."
"BEIRUT — A ""colossal"" explosion rocked the port area of Lebanon's capital, Beirut, on Tuesday, injuring thousands and causing widespread damage in a densely populated part of the city.
At least 3,000 people have been injured and 50 killed, Minister of Health Hassan Hamad said at a press conference. Those numbers are likely to rise with hospitals filling up fast.
Images and videos on social media appear to show large plumes of smoke and damaged buildings in the Middle Eastern country, but the cause of the blast and its exact..."
"President Trump said Friday morning that the United States military had been “cocked and loaded” for a strike against Iran on Thursday night, but that he called it off with 10 minutes to spare when a general told him that 150 people would likely die in the attack.
The president said in a series of tweets just after 9 a.m. that he was prepared to retaliate against three sites in Iran for that country’s shooting down an American drone, but that he was “in no hurry.” He indicated that the..."
"Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated on Wednesday at his home by a group of unidentified gunmen, interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said. Joseph said the security situation in the country was ""under the control"" of Haiti's police and military.
Haiti has suffered for years from political instability, and Moïse had been governing by decree. Critics had accused the 53-year-old of ruling like an autocrat.
""An unidentified group of individuals, some of whom were speaking in Spanish, attacked the private residence of the President of the Republic and mortally wounded..."
"The first day of early voting in Georgia set a midterm turnout record, with over 133,000 in-person voters casting their ballots, an early sign of strong interest in this year’s elections.
Turnout on Monday far exceeded the last midterms in 2018, when about 71,000 people showed up at the start of early voting, according to state election data.
The fast start put Georgia on pace to surpass the 3.9 million voters who cast ballots four years ago, though turnout appears unlikely to reach the 5 million voters who participated in the 2020..."
"Goya, which says it's the nation's largest Hispanic-owned food brand, is facing a backlash after its chief executive met with and heaped praise on President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday.
On Twitter, #BoycottGoya and #GoyaFoods were trending in the United States, and some Latinos were also using the hashtag #goyaway.
Trump reached out to Latino voters Thursday with a promised expansion of his ""Hispanic Prosperity Initiative,"" an effort said to include more taxpayer support for charter and private schools, and added tax benefits for ""Opportunity Zone"" development..."
"The Strategic National Stockpile, a once little-known resource, has turned into a political tug-of-war as states scramble for gowns, masks, ventilators and other equipment during the coronavirus pandemic.
But it was never intended to be able to meet massive, simultaneous demand from 50 states, its former director said.
“The Strategic National Stockpile is great as a fallback"" that can be tapped after private sector supplies and state and local government supplies are exhausted, said Greg Burel, who is now president and principal consultant at Hamilton Grace, a consulting firm focused..."
"President Joe Biden is planning to increase the maximum number of refugees allowed into the United States next fiscal year to 125,000 beginning in October after years of cuts by the previous administration.
“It’s going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged,” Biden said in a speech Thursday, “but that’s precisely what we’re going to do.”
The plan to dramatically increase the cap comes after former president Donald Trump decimated the country’s refugee program, designed to take in people fleeing dangerous conditions, and forced US-based aid..."
"Democrats went into Election Day hoping to reclaim the White House and majorities in both chambers of Congress in a victory that would demonstrate an unmistakable repudiation of President Donald Trump and a Republican Party remade in his image.
It didn’t work out that way.
More than 12 hours after polls closed, Biden held a narrow lead in some key states with hundreds of thousands of votes yet to be counted, and he has a comfortable advantage in the national popular vote. But as of midday Wednesday, there was no..."
"I have finally seen enough. Donald Trump will be indicted by a federal grand jury.
You heard me right: I believe Trump will actually be indicted for a criminal offense. Even with all its redactions, the probable cause affidavit published today by the magistrate judge in Florida makes clear to me three essential points:
(1) Trump was in unauthorized possession of national defense information, namely properly marked classified documents.
(2) He was put on notice by the U.S. Government that he was not permitted to retain those documents at Mar-a-Lago...."
"The Navy announced it was considering kicking Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher out of the SEALs Wednesday even though President Donald Trump had recently reversed his demotion. It was a stunning move.
Trump clearly seemed outraged by the prospect. He tweeted in response Thursday morning that “the Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin” (the official sign of membership in the SEALs), though whether that will lead to the cancellation of the Navy's review remains unclear.
The Navy’s willingness to try to discipline..."
"The U.S. Navy said Thursday that it will proceed with a hearing to consider the expulsion of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher from the Navy SEALs, despite his support from President Trump.
Gallagher and three supervising officers were informed of the administrative review board hearing, set for Dec. 2, on Wednesday.
""The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin,"" said Trump in a tweet earlier Thursday. ""This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!""
The Trident Pin is..."
"I have never heard anyone refer to Bernie Sanders' ""handlers,"" like they have referred to Hillary Clinton's handlers here, here and here, because unlike Hillary Clinton whose every step seems deliberate, Bernie Sanders appears raw, honest and real as evidenced by his trademark unkempt hair and his vigorously delivered, unscripted rhetoric. Unlike his key Democratic opponent whom he refuses to bash, Sanders appears both honest and trustworthy. Although some perceive his style as unconventional as he delivers his message without the drab, planned and rehearsed monotony of his rival, this..."
"The summer of Sanders is heating up.
In just the past week, 28,000 people showed up to see Bernie Sanders in Portland, Oregon, including about 9,000 people who were content to watch the Vermont senator on giant screens in the overflow area. Another 28,000 people joined him in Los Angeles.
All told, Sanders has brought his wonky brand of populism to 100,000"
"Her name is Frances Haugen. That is a fact that Facebook has been anxious to know since last month when an anonymous former employee filed complaints with federal law enforcement. The complaints say Facebook's own research shows that it amplifies hate, misinformation and political unrest—but the company hides what it knows. One complaint alleges that Facebook's Instagram harms teenage girls. What makes Haugen's complaints unprecedented is the trove of private Facebook research she took when she quit in May. The documents appeared first, last month, in the Wall Street Journal...."
"More than $8bn has been pledged by private corporations and non-profit groups to help Joe Biden achieve his goal to end hunger and cut diet-related diseases, White House officials announced on Wednesday.
Donors include food industry lobby groups, pharmaceutical companies, the world’s second largest meat packing company, medical associations, a film studio, as well as philanthropic foundations and universities.
The announcement comes as the White House hosts the first conference on hunger, nutrition and health in 53 years. Since then food insecurity has improved but remains shockingly high with one in 10..."
"More than 1.5 million American workers filed jobless claims last week as the coronavirus crisis wages on, the Department of Labor said Thursday, the fewest number of filings since the crisis began.
The number of new unemployment filings has leveled off since peaking in late March even though millions of workers are still out of work as pandemic restrictions ease and states begin to reopen.
Still, some 43 million American workers have filed for unemployment insurance since mid-March. COVID-19 has pushed the U.S. unemployment rate to levels not seen since..."
"President Trump announced Tuesday that Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) has withdrawn his name from consideration for the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ""Tom is a fine man and a great congressman,"" Trump tweeted while sharing the news. On Sunday night, 60 Minutes and The Washington Post reported that Marino had worked for two years to push through a bill promoted and apparently written by the pharmaceutical industry that stripped the Drug Enforcement Administration of its biggest tool to fight prescription opioids entering the black market."
"President Trump said Tuesday that his nominee to be the nation's drug czar is withdrawing from consideration for the job. Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) was under fire in the wake of revelations in a Washington Post/""60 Minutes” investigation that the lawmaker helped steer legislation in Congress making it harder to act against giant drug companies."
"Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson is suing former President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and two far-right groups — the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers — for allegedly conspiring to incite the deadly violence on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol.
The lawsuit, filed on Thompson's behalf by the NAACP and the civil rights law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, accuses Trump and the other defendants of violating the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act by trying to interfere in Congress' certification of the Electoral College count. The legislation was part..."
"The House Homeland Security chairman accused Donald Trump in a federal lawsuit Tuesday of inciting the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and conspiring with his lawyer and extremist groups to try to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the presidential election he lost to Joe Biden.
The lawsuit from Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson is part of an expected wave of litigation over the Jan. 6 riot and is believed to be the first filed by a member of Congress. It seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages. It also..."
"Virginia will have the eyes of the political world on it Tuesday night. Most of the attention will be on the marquee gubernatorial election between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin. Less watched, but important for its national implications, are the elections for the 100 seats in the House of Delegates.
If the polls are to be believed, Republicans are going to do very well in Virginia given the political baseline in the state. Traditionally, this would foretell a strong Republican performance in next year's midterms. In fact, given Virginia is more blue than..."
"Several members of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s leadership team pressed her to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump in a series of Monday night meetings, according to multiple officials in the rooms — an effort the speaker rebuffed each time.
At least five members of Pelosi’s leadership team — four of whom also sit on the House Judiciary Committee, with jurisdiction over impeachment — pressed Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a closed-door leadership meeting to allow the panel to start an inquiry, which they argued would help investigators attain documents and..."
"The White House is expected to announce plans Friday to reinstate a Reagan-era gag rule that would prohibit health care organizations who provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funding through Title X. The Title X program provides funding for contraception, Pap smears, cancer screenings, breast and pelvic exams, and pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease testing among other reproductive health services. Trump's domestic gag rule would impact Planned Parenthood's funding directly despite the fact that federal family planning funds are already barred from being used to cover the cost..."
"President Obama plans to propose raising $ 320 billion over the next 10 years in new taxes targeting wealthy individuals and big financial institutions to pay for new programs designed to help lower- and middle-income families, senior administration officials said Saturday.
In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Obama will propose raising the capital gains and dividend tax rates to 28 percent for high earners; imposing a fee on the liabilities of about 100 big financial institutions; and"
"The billionaire Elon Musk has taken an almost $3bn (£2.3bn) stake in Twitter to become the social media platform’s largest shareholder.
The world’s richest man, who has a penchant for eccentric behaviour frequently involving posts on Twitter, has built a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to filings made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday.
The boss of Tesla and SpaceX, who with more than 80 million followers ranks in the top 10 most popular Twitter users globally, paid $2.89bn for the stake at Twitter’s closing share price on Friday.

"The Senate prepared for a rare Saturday session as it struggled to pass a $1.1 trillion spending package notable for its expansive spending on military and disease fighting abroad, as well as its scaling back of financial and environmental regulations at home.
Partisan maneuvering on Friday disrupted what both Democratic and Republican leaders had expected to be a relatively smooth path toward final passage, a late-night twist that is emblematic of the dysfunction plaguing the 113th Congress."
"For most people, it's not that partisan loyalty is all that meaningful. It's more that firmly-held positions on issues — particularly social issues such as abortion and gay marriage — are wrapped up tight with their overall world views, says Peter Hatemi, a political scientist at Penn State University."
"The Obama administration has expressed deep concerns to the governors of New York and New Jersey and is consulting with them to modify their orders to quarantine medical volunteers returning from West Africa as President Obama seeks to quickly develop a new, nationwide policy for the workers, according to two senior administration officials.
One administration official said the federal government has been pressing the governors to back off their decisions, which quarantine all medical workers who had contact with Ebola patients. But another official said the administration has not specifically..."
"The White House on Sunday said that it is working on new guidelines for health care workers returning from Ebola-stricken areas, according to a senior administration official.
The decision comes as governors in Illinois, New Jersey and New York announced over the weekend that they were instituting quarantines for aid workers returning from Ebola-stricken West Africa.
The White House stopped short of calling on the governors to reverse their quarantine rules, but administration officials have made clear to the governors that they have concerns with uninten"
"With both major-party presidential candidates vying for working-class voters, Hillary Clinton on Thursday followed Donald J. Trump to Michigan to outline her job-creation plans, answering his economic address on Monday in Detroit. Mrs. Clinton spoke at Futuramic Tool & Engineering Company in Macomb County, long known as a home to political ticket-splitters. Some of her statements deserved a closer look. Here are a few."
"White House officials moved quickly on Wednesday to calm fears of a potential trade war with China, saying the administration’s proposed tariffs were a “threat” that would ultimately help, not hurt, the United States economy, hours after China said it would punish American products with similar levies."
"North Korea's Internet is offline — days after President Obama pledged a ""proportional response"" to the communist country's alleged hacking of Sony Pictures, multiple news reports say.
Doug Madory, the director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, told The New York Times and other news organizations that North Korea's Internet access became unstable late Friday. By Monday, it was offline, he said.
San Francisco-based CloudFlare, a network and security company that monitors global Web access, told The Times that North Korea's Internet access was ""toast.""
It's unclear what caused the..."
"North Korea experienced a widespread Internet outage on Monday, less than a week after the FBI accused the country of being behind the hack that forced Sony Pictures to cancel the release of 'The Interview.' The Internet blackout began sometime Monday morning Eastern Time, a U.S. official confirmed to NBC News. A second U.S. official strongly denied any U.S. involvement in the outage. It was not immediately clear what had caused the outage, which came after President Barack Obama promised that the United States would ""respond proportionally"" to what he..."
"In 2005, my colleagues at The American Prospect, Sam Rosenfeld and Matt Yglesias, wrote an essay I think about often. It was called “The Incompetence Dodge,” and it argued that American policymakers and pundits routinely try to rescue the reputation of bad ideas by attributing their failure to poor execution. At the time, they were writing about the liberal hawks who were blaming the catastrophe of the Iraq war on the Bush administration’s maladministration rather than rethinking the enterprise in its totality. But the same dynamic suffuses the recriminations over..."
"Kyle Rittenhouse testified Wednesday he was under attack when he killed two men and wounded a third with his rifle during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, saying: “I didn’t do anything wrong. I defended myself.”
In a high-stakes gamble, the 18-year-old took the stand at his murder trial to tell his side of what happened on the streets that day in the summer of 2020, sobbing so hard at one point that the judge called a break.
In an account largely corroborated by video and the prosecution’s own..."
"Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who shot at protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year and killed two people, took the stand in his murder trial Wednesday, testifying that he ""didn't do anything wrong"" and was acting in self-defense.
""I didn't intend to kill them. I intended to stop the people who were attacking me,"" Rittenhouse said about the shooting on Aug. 25, 2020.
Rittenhouse, who was 17 years old at the time, told prosecutors that he ""used deadly force"" against the victims because he perceived them to be a threat to..."
"When Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas announced last week a vague ambition to pick up where former President Donald J. Trump left off and complete the construction of a multibillion-dollar wall along the border with Mexico, many in the state were puzzled. A wall is costly and, in Texas, would require cutting a swath across private ranches, difficult terrain and some urban areas.
On Wednesday, Mr. Abbott revealed how he would pay for it: Donations.
Flanked by lawmakers at the State Capitol, Mr. Abbott, a staunch Republican who has found..."
"On Tuesday night, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot three people in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with an AR-15-style rifle, killing two. Videos of the event tell us an incomplete story of what, exactly, happened that night. But they appear to clearly show this much: Rittenhouse traveled to the protests in illegal possession of an assault weapon to act as a vigilante. He placed himself at the center of the violence, then escalated it by shooting a man in the head. Minutes later, he shot two more people who appeared to be trying..."
"Hiring around the U.S. slowed sharply last month as the coronavirus battered the economy, the Labor Department said Friday. Employers added 245,000 jobs in November — the slowest pace of monthly job growth since April, and about half what economists had expected.
Payroll gains last month amount a sharp drop from the 610,000 jobs added in October and 710,000 in September. The nation's unemployment rate, which has steadily declined since peaking at nearly 15% in April, ticked down to 6.7%. But it fell for a bad reason — 400,000 people..."
"Now that Joe Manchin has once again pulled the rug out from under him, essentially nixing the possibility of getting any climate legislation through for the near future, Joe Biden is under pressure to do whatever he can through executive action to combat climate change. Democrats have renewed calls on Biden to take “forceful, firm, and wide-ranging” action on the environment in recent days — and the president appears ready to to do just that, with White House officials telling reporters that he could declare a climate emergency as soon as this week.

"Anna Ruch had never met Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo before encountering him at a crowded New York City wedding reception in September 2019. Her first impression was positive enough.
The governor was working the room after toasting the newlyweds, and when he came upon Ms. Ruch, now 33, she thanked him for his kind words about her friends. But what happened next instantly unsettled her: Mr. Cuomo put his hand on Ms. Ruch’s bare lower back, she said in an interview on Monday.

"A third woman came forward late Monday to accuse Gov. Andrew Cuomo of an unwanted advance, this time at a wedding in 2019.
The latest case comes after a former aide to Cuomo earlier Monday ripped his explanation Sunday of ""playful"" banter with his staff, saying he is failing to take responsibility for sexually harassing her.

"America’s employers added just 266,000 jobs last month, sharply lower than in March and a sign that some businesses are struggling to find enough workers as the economic recovery strengthens.

At the same time, optimism about the economic recovery is growing. Many Americans are flush with cash after having received $1,400 federal relief checks, along..."
"The US economy added only 266,000 jobs in April at the anniversary of the worst job loss for any month on record. This was far less than forecasts of economists, who had predicted America would add 1 million jobs last month.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in April, up from 6% a month earlier.
It was the slowest improvement for jobs since January. Experts predicted that the vaccine rollout and the reopening of the economy would jolt hiring. But the April jobs number show that the road to recovery..."

"President Donald Trump returned from his forced Twitter hiatus on Thursday with a nearly three-minute video in which he finally condemned the violence his supporters carried out at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.
“Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem,” he said. It was a far cry from the supportive messages he sent to the rioters acting in his name the day before, when he told them, “We love you, you’re very special.”
The outgoing president also acknowledged that “a new administration will be inaugurated..."
"The Biden administration on Tuesday announced U.S. immigration authorities will no longer carry out mass arrests of unauthorized immigrants at work sites, saying law enforcement efforts should focus on holding exploitative employers accountable.
In a memo, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should prioritize combating illegal acts committed by ""unscrupulous"" employers, whom he noted often pay workers substandard wages, subject them to unsafe working conditions and facilitate human trafficking and child exploitation.
""Our worksite enforcement efforts can have a significant impact on the well-being of individuals and..."
"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday signed a massive overhaul of election laws, shortly after the Republican-controlled state legislature approved it. The bill enacts new limitations on mail-in voting, expands most voters' access to in-person early voting and caps a months-long battle over voting in a battleground state.
""With Senate bill 202, Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair,"" Kemp told reporters Thursday evening.
Kemp's remarks during the signing appeared to have been cut short as Democratic state Rep. Park Cannon was escorted..."
"Georgia lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to impose sweeping new restrictions on voting access in the state that make it harder to vote by mail and give the state legislature more power over elections.
The measure was signed into law by Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, on Thursday evening. “Significant reforms to our state elections were needed. There’s no doubt there were many alarming issues with how the election was handled, and those problems, understandably, led to a crisis of confidence,” Kemp said during prepared remarks shortly..."
"Weeks ago, as President Donald Trump warned that ICE agents were preparing raids across the country, a 41-year-old housekeeper and babysitter in Miami headed to the grocery store with her daughter.
They knew they'd be staying inside and needed to stock up on supplies.
""I felt that day like it was a hurricane coming,"" the undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua told CNN.
Since then, the raids Trump threatened haven't happened. But for millions of undocumented immigrants living across the United States, the storm is still brewing.
With a new threat of..."
"Secretary of State John Kerry was right to push this week for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. All outside parties should do everything they can to end a war in which both Israel and Hamas have seemed willing to fight to the death of the last Palestinian civilian. Perhaps a path out of the madness can be found during the 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire set to begin early Friday today.
Kerry has been slammed as naive for pressing Israel to end its attack, which as of this writing has cost the..."
"The Manhattan district attorney can obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday, dealing the President another setback in his effort to shield his tax returns from investigators but the case is likely to head to the Supreme Court.
The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals broadly rejected Trump's arguments that the subpoena for his records was overly broad and issued in bad faith.
""We have considered all of the President's remaining contentions on appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal,"" the..."
"President Trump’s purge of the nation’s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration, including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents, current and former administration officials said Monday.
Mr. Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to..."
"A voting technology company swept up in baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election filed a monster $2.7 billion lawsuit on Thursday against Fox News, some of the network's star hosts, and pro-Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, alleging the parties worked in concert to wage a ""disinformation campaign"" that has jeopardized its very survival.
""We have no choice,"" Antonio Mugica, the chief executive and founder of Smartmatic, told CNN Business in an interview about the company's decision to file the lawsuit. ""The disinformation campaign that was launched against..."
"America’s attempt to replicate the Canadian trucker protest movement got off to a slow start Wednesday as a modest number of trucks hit the road on their way to Washington, DC.
Loosely connected organizers are trying to replicate the success of the anti–vaccine mandate Freedom Convoy, which traveled from Western Canada to the capital city of Ottawa. Hundreds of vehicles and thousands of protesters effectively took over downtown Ottawa for three weeks before police cleared them out.
A lightly rebranded People’s Convoy took off from Southern California Wednesday in the same spirit. Around a dozen..."
"There are three different types of long Covid and each has its own set of symptoms, according to researchers.
Experts from King’s College London examined 1,459 people living with long Covid - defined by the study authors as suffering symptoms for at least 84 days after infection - and found there appeared to be three “subtypes” of the condition.
A pre-print of the study, published on medRxiv, revealed people with long Covid appeared to be split into three main groups, including:
Those with neurological symptoms including fatigue, brain fog

"The strike on the al-Asad and Erbil bases represent the first known retaliation to Trump’s killing of an Iranian commander. Reportedly no Americans were killed.
Iran attacked at least two bases in Iraq that house American military forces on Wednesday morning local time, Iranian and U.S. officials said.
It launched ballistic missiles in its first move against the U.S. since President Donald Trump ordered an American drone strike to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, dramatically escalating tensions between the two countries. The offensive did not cause any casualties among American..."
"President Barack Obama wants to be remembered as the president who saved the world from climate change. But the 195-nation accord aimed at curbing global warming may be the most fragile of his presidential achievements so far.
More than any of his other top accomplishments—economic recovery, health care reform, the Iran deal, all of which involved Congress to some extent—Obama’s environmental legacy rests on the exercise of executive power over the objections of Republican lawmakers."
"After two weeks of bleary all-nighters in Paris, diplomats from around the world have hammered out a major global agreement to address climate change. Here's the full 31-page document, which was approved by 195 countries on Saturday.
It's important to be clear on what this wad of paper actually does. The Paris climate agreement hasn't saved the planet and it hasn't solved global warming. Not by itself. Instead, the deal is supposed to add structure and momentum to efforts that are currently u"
"Special counsel John Durham accused a lawyer for the Democrats of sharing with the CIA in 2017 internet data purported to show Russian-made phones being used in the vicinity of the White House complex, as part of a broader effort to raise the intelligence community's suspicions of Donald Trump's ties to Russia shortly after he took office.
The accusation -- which Durham couched in vague, technical language in a court filing late Friday -- has been seized upon by Trump and his supporters, who claim the former President was subjected to a..."
"Days after a national eviction moratorium expired, the Biden administration on Tuesday issued a new, more limited freeze that remains in effect through Oct. 3.
Like the previous order, the two-month moratorium issued Tuesday comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The new ban on evictions covers parts of the United States that are experiencing what the CDC calls ""substantial"" and ""high"" spread of the coronavirus.
As of Tuesday afternoon, that's the vast majority of U.S. counties.
The order, which cites the rise of the delta variant, says: ""Without this Order, evictions in..."
"A new member of the liberal “Squad” stepped to the forefront this week, leading a Capitol steps sit-in that forced the White House to act.
Cori Bush arrived in Congress as an heir to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now the political neophyte is coming into her own.
Bush has led a one-woman protest on the Capitol steps over the last several days that forced the eviction crisis to the top of the nation's agenda even after the House left town without taking action on the issue. Under intense pressure from the left,..."
"The Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation on Tuesday that would pour nearly a quarter-trillion dollars over the next five years into scientific research and development to bolster competitiveness against China.
Republicans and Democrats — overcoming their traditional partisan differences over economic policy — banded together to endorse what would be the most significant government intervention in industrial policy in decades. It includes federal investments in a slew of emerging technologies as well as the semiconductor industry."
"In an attempt to salvage stalled negotiations, Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a revised counteroffer for infrastructure spending, outlining roughly $928 billion in a package that’s still far short of what the White House has proposed.
Only about a quarter of the total price tag appears to represent new spending above baseline levels under the “roadmap” put forward by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and her GOP counterparts. But lawmakers still stressed that their retooled approach “delivers on much” of what Biden had recommended in earlier talks between the two..."
"As the fall semester approaches, the decision of whether to bring millions of students and staff back to school has fallen largely on local school districts and university administrators.
But in order to prepare for the eventuality of coronavirus surges on campus, and avoid shuttering campus gates once more, a former administration official says that the Trump White House needs to implement a national COVID-19 testing strategy in order to safely reopen and return to ""normal.""
""A national approach to testing is the way that we will get to..."
"It probably made sense on paper: invite presidential candidates to visit the Iowa Republican Party’s tent in the parking lot before the big Iowa vs. Iowa State football game on Saturday.
What planners did not anticipate was the portable mob scene that characterizes the candidacy of Donald J. Trump.
Arriving more than an hour late, Mr. Trump offered a speech of less than a minute on the state party’s stage. But that was beside the point, as star-struck supporters greeted him like a stadium rocker during a sprawling tailgate party..."
"With still months to go before the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump hopped in a golf cart here at Iowa State University and took a victory lap.
Hundreds of rowdy football fans swarmed the businessman-turned-presidential candidate Saturday as he zipped around the football stadium -- each extending a hand, hoping for a high-five, and maybe a selfie.
""Go get 'em Donald!"" one man shouted as Trump worked the tailgating crowd before the day's Iowa-Iowa State game."
"Former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon has been convicted for refusing to testify and provide documents to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
A federal court jury in Washington deliberated for less than three hours before finding Bannon guilty Friday afternoon on two counts of contempt of Congress, which the Justice Department brought last year after he defied a subpoena from the House panel. The committee sought his testimony related to his contacts with Donald Trump amid Trump’s effort to overturn his defeat..."
"MANCHESTER, N.H — Joe Biden's and Elizabeth Warren's poor finishes in New Hampshire raise daunting questions about the future of their campaigns after both former front-runners were denied podium positions by a late-surging Amy Klobuchar.
Biden appears set to finish fifth and Warren fourth — a stunning result for two candidates who were neck and neck for national front-runner status as recently as October — and NBC News projected Tuesday that neither of them would meet the threshold to collect any delegates.
Klobuchar impressed at the last debate and a..."
"In a month of terrible anti-Semitic attacks, including a stabbing yesterday of multiple people at a Hanukkah celebration at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, New York, the news that most depressed me did not involve violence. It was not something done to Jews but something Jews did. A synagogue in the Netherlands is no longer publicly posting the times of prayer services. If you want to join a service, you have to know someone who is a member of the community."
"The Supreme Court on Friday offered a short-term compromise that would continue to exempt a group of Denver nuns that operates charity nursing homes from the birth control mandate of the nation's health care law if they declare their objections in writing.
The nuns will take the court up on its offer and provide a written notice, officials said.
The justices asked the nuns to write the Department of Health and Human Services declaring themselves a religiou"
"The Education Department on Monday opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions.
The department’s Office for Civil Rights announced the investigations in letters to education chiefs in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. Those states have issued varying prohibitions on universal mask requirements, which the office says could prevent some students from safely attending school.
Education Secretary Miguel Cardona accused the states of “putting politics..."
"Federal education authorities launched five investigations into statewide school mask bans on Monday, ratcheting up the Biden administration's feud with Republican governors as Covid-19 infections disrupt the fall back-to-school season in some communities.
The Department of Education’s civil rights office will review indoor masking prohibitions in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, and examine whether bans in those states violate the rights of students with disabilities.
“It’s simply unacceptable that state leaders are putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement...."
"Democracy is facing a moment of reckoning.
For 15 years, global freedom has declined, according to the human rights organization Freedom House. It’s happening in authoritarian countries, where rulers have restricted people’s freedoms, canceled and postponed elections, and cracked down on political opponents with increasing brutality – and in democratic countries, where mis- and disinformation have eroded trust in public institutions, political polarization has widened, and long-standing challenges like economic inequality and systemic sexism and racism have left many feeling like the system won’t ever work for them.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made these problems more acute. Unscrupulous leaders have seized the opportunity to crush freedom of assembly and crank up surveillance,..."
"Inflation came in strong and wage growth remained elevated at the end of 2021. At the same time, consumer spending fell in December as spiraling coronavirus caseloads kept many Americans at home and persistent supply chain bottlenecks disrupted holiday shopping.
Those indicators, released on Friday, underline that despite plummeting unemployment and a strong rebound in growth, the economy — like the country itself — has yet to break free of the pandemic’s grip. That is making for a confusing and contradictory moment headed into 2022.
Rising prices and an unflagging pandemic are..."
"A 15-count indictment for tax fraud and other charges filed in New York on Thursday against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, has already stimulated as much hand-wringing as satisfaction from those who have called for accountability for Donald Trump.
Some express concern that Mr. Trump himself was not charged and may never be. Others note that these are “only” state tax fraud counts against his business and an associate — rather than bold federal action against Mr. Trump himself by the Justice Department.
As former federal..."
"After days of intense negotiations, the United States and Russia reached agreement Saturday on a framework to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014 and impose U.N. penalties if the Assad government fails to comply.
The deal, announced by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, includes what Kerry called ""a shared assessment"" of the weapons stockpile, and a timetable and measures for Syrian President Bashar Assad to follow so that the full inventory can be identified and seized.
The U.S. and..."
"Even as they trade barbs publicly -- and even as artillery shells and accusations continue to fly in Syria -- the United States and Russia could take solace Friday in at least one respect: They are still talking.
Discussions between the two in Geneva -- centered around Moscow's proposal to have Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government hand over its chemical weapons stockpile -- were supposed to end Friday. They continued through the night and were extended into Saturday for a reason, U.S. officials said.
""If there was no..."
"The Biden administration on Monday transferred a Guantánamo Bay detainee to his home country for the first time, a policy shift from the Trump presidency that repatriated a Moroccan man years after he was recommended for discharge.
The prisoner, Abdullatif Nasser, who’s in his mid-50s, was cleared for repatriation by a review board in July 2016 but remained at Guantánamo under President Donald Trump. In announcing his transfer Monday, the Pentagon cited the board’s determination that Nasser’s detention was no longer necessary to protect U.S. national security.
Nasser, also known as Abdul..."
"President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts will be locked through at least Inauguration Day, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday, amid Democratic calls for social media companies to expel him permanently for inciting Wednesday's deadly violence in the Capitol.
But a leading House Republican on tech issues warned against ""censoring"" the president, saying Trump should instead use his access to tens of millions of followers to ""lower the temperature"" on social media."
"After originally planning to block President Donald Trump from posting to his Facebook and Instagram account for 24 hours, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that the blocks have been extended ""indefinitely.""
""We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post Thursday. ""Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is..."
"The first nurse to test positive for the Ebola virus will be transferred from a Dallas hospital to a state-of-the-art National Institutes of Health facility in Bethesda, Md., for treatment, federal and local health officials say.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Nina Pham would be transferred later Thursday. Pham, 26, has been reported in good condition by officials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where she contracted the virus while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died Oct. 8."
"When Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola two weeks ago, authorities said not to worry — he had no symptoms during his flights from Liberia to Dallas. They said the disease could be spread only by someone who was showing signs such as fever and only through bodily fluids such as vomit. They told passengers who rode with Duncan they couldn’t catch it because it isn’t transmitted through the air.
And, they said, if a passenger is sick or has a fever, the person won’t fly.
Now the Centers..."

In a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision, Comey said ""the FBI cannot yet assess"" whether the information is ""significant"" nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make..."
"The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.
In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a..."

"A second COVID-19 candidate vaccine looks to be even more effective than the first, with both protecting more than 90% of those who get the shots.
Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, announced early Monday that its candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, developed in collaboration with the U.S. government, appears to be 94.5% effective against the disease.
Earlier this month, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, announced early effectiveness data, showing their vaccine, called BNT162b2, had protected more than 90% of those who received it.
Both results are preliminary, with final..."

"(CNN) -- For months and months, Republicans -- led by President Donald Trump -- have pointed to an ongoing probe into the origins of the FBI's counterintelligence Russia meddling investigation as the smoking gun of the 2020 (and 2016) election.

To repeat Biden’s feat in a pair of Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, with control of the Senate on the line, the Democratic Party will have to defy a long track record of failure in overtime elections. They’ll need to overcome the entire weight of the Republican Party descending on the state — from organizers and operatives to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.

Rittenhouse and his lawyers have argued that he was acting in self-defense when he shot three people with his AR-15-style rifle. In a dramatic turn on the stand last week, Rittenhouse testified that he feared for his life.
In his closing arguments Monday, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger argued that Rittenhouse created the peril he faced..."
"A prosecutor hoping to send Kyle Rittenhouse to prison made closing arguments in his homicide trial on Monday. The jury was expected to begin weighing later in the day whether Mr. Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense, or needlessly and illegally, when he shot three men in Kenosha last summer, two of them fatally, during a night of unrest.

Fearing more deaths statewide from Covid-19, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, reissued several mask mandates recently, only to be rebuffed at every interval by Republicans in the Legislature.

"The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is investigating as a hate crime an altercation Tuesday night near Hollywood where witness reports said Jewish people dining at a restaurant were targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian men driving past in vehicles.
Officers responded to an altercation outside a sushi restaurant around 9:50 p.m. on Tuesday, where five victims suffered minor injuries, LAPD Public Information Officer Jeff Lee confirmed to CNN. No arrests were made and three suspects are outstanding, Lee said. They were last seen leaving the scene in a Jeep,..."
"Senate Democrats suffered a loss on Tuesday when Republican opposition sunk their signature voting and election bill during a key test vote, underscoring the limits of the party's power with the narrowest possible Senate majority.
A procedural vote to open debate on the legislation was defeated by a tally of 50-50, falling short of the 60 votes needed to succeed. Democrats were united in favor of the vote after securing support from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, but Republicans were united against it, causing the measure to fail to..."
"John Kerry, a former secretary of state, said on Monday that he had never discussed covert Israeli airstrikes in Syria with Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, contrary to Mr. Zarif’s claim in a leaked conversation.
Mr. Zarif and Mr. Kerry spoke constantly when the two were negotiating the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The Iranian foreign minister said in the recording, reported by The New York Times on Sunday, that Mr. Kerry had informed him that Israel had attacked Iranian interests in Syria at least 200 times.
The claim sparked..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will shift his focus to American energy dominance during a stop in Texas later this week that will include his first visit to an oil rig.
During the stop Wednesday at Double Eagle Energy in the west Texas city of Midland, Trump will discuss how the U.S. is achieving energy dominance by cutting regulations, simplifying permitting and encouraging private investment in energy infrastructure, the White House said.
Trump will also tour an oil rig in Midland, the city where former President George W. Bush..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders has called off all campaign events “until further notice” after being hospitalized with chest pain, a spokesman said Wednesday.
According to Sanders’ senior adviser Jeff Weaver, the 78-year-old candidate “experienced some chest discomfort” at a Tuesday night campaign event in Nevada. Doctors found a “blockage” in one of his arteries, and the senator had two stents inserted.
“Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,” Weaver said. “He will be resting up over the next few days.”"
"President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday boosting America's cyber defenses following a ransomware attack on a company that operates a pipeline that provides nearly half of the gasoline and jet fuel for the country's East Coast.
The broad order, which the administration had been working on for months, aims to strengthen cybersecurity for federal networks and outline new security standards for commercial software used by both business and the public.
""Recent cybersecurity incidents such as SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, and the Colonial Pipeline incident are a sobering reminder that U.S...."
"President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at shoring up the federal government’s digital defenses as his administration grapples with cybersecurity crises, including a ransomware strike on a major fuel pipeline that has caused gas shortages.
Less than four months into his tenure, Biden has had to respond to a Russian cyberespionage operation that affected nine federal agencies and about 100 American companies, as well as a Chinese cyberhacking campaign that compromised tens of thousands of small and midsize firms that used Microsoft Exchange email servers.
On Saturday, Colonial..."
"Kenia Alcocer is used to sitting down at the kitchen table to crunch her family's monthly budget and figure out how she can make ends meet.
But this month is different. Alcocer, 34, gave birth in January to her second child, a boy named Genaro, whose numerous health issues have added a huge financial strain on her family. Now, with the coronavirus pandemic putting millions of people out of work and increasing financial anxiety across the country, she doesn't think she'll be able to make rent.

"Mounting economic fallout from the pandemic is fueling apartment landlords’ concerns that more tenants will struggle to make their rent payments, even after most managed to come up with the money for April.
“May 1 will be a bigger watershed,” said John Pawlowski, a senior analyst at real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. “Think about when the job losses started accelerating.”
Only 69% of renters had made a full or partial payment during the first week of April, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday sharply cut back the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to reduce the carbon output of existing power plants, a blow to the Biden administration’s plans for combating climate change.
The vote was 6 to 3, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing for the court’s conservatives.
“Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible ‘solution to the crisis of the day,’ ” Roberts wrote, referring to a..."
"The Supreme Court began its new term Monday with a new justice on the bench, the public back in the courtroom and a spirited debate in a case that pits environmental protections against property rights.
The new member of the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, wasted no time joining the lively give-and-take, asking questions throughout nearly two hours of arguments in the dispute over the nation’s main anti-water pollution law, the Clean Water Act.
Jackson, appointed by President Joe Biden, seemed to be generally aligned with the court’s other two liberal justices in..."
"Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Wednesday that the federal government had agreed to withdraw its law enforcement officers from Portland, where violent protests have persisted for weeks — but the Department of Homeland Security indicated it would keep its officers on the ground for the time being.
The dueling statements mark another twist in the increasingly fractious communications between local and federal officials about the violence in Portland.
In a series of tweets Wednesday morning, Brown said that the Trump administration had “agreed to withdraw federal officers from Portland” starting..."
"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Federal agents who have clashed with protesters in Portland, Oregon, will begin a “phased withdrawal” from the city, Gov. Kate Brown said Wednesday.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement the plan negotiated with Brown over the last 24 hours includes a “robust presence” of Oregon State Police in the downtown of the state’s largest city.
“State and local law enforcement will begin securing properties and streets, especially those surrounding federal properties, that have been under nightly attack for the past two months,”..."
"Timothy Stanley: Pugnacious Biden took on a wonkish Ryan. This was a strange debate, even an ugly one. The two men looked like they were taking part in separate discussions. Ryan was speaking in the economics seminar at some obscure think tank. Biden was shouting answers in the middle of a loud sports bar."
"Tonight was a battle for voters in the middle. Both parties put their finest soldiers in the field. Better equipped than Obama and Romney -- distant and aloof standard-bearers -- Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan grew up among the ranks of the people they need to win. And tonight on the TVs across middle-class America, Joe Biden was a hero."
"Jackson, Wyoming (CNN)Former President Donald Trump's campaign to purge the Republican Party of his opponents could reach its most dramatic moment of the 2022 midterm election cycle on Tuesday in Wyoming.
Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House committee investigating January 6, 2021, who was booted from her House leadership position and censured by the GOP organization in her state after voting to impeach Trump, faces the Trump-backed Harriet Hageman and three other candidates in the GOP primary for the state's lone House seat.
A Cheney loss would be a demonstration that..."
"REPUBLICANS COLLECTED a significant victory in Tuesday’s midterm elections, gaining control of the Senate to go with their control of the House. With that win comes an increased level of responsibility for the nation’s fortunes. They can no longer behave like a petty opposition party. If the GOP wants to prove before 2016 that it is better at governing than the Democrats, this is its chance to address a backlog of problems — to seek results, rather than continue to blame others for failure."
"George Pataki announced his presidential candidacy in Exeter, N.H., Thursday, the eighth official Republican entrant in the 2016 race for the White House. The field is expected to double over the next couple of months. Pataki has made numerous visits and a few friends in recent months in the Granite State, home of the first primary in 2016. Still, the mention of his name in most of the country might prompt questions of, ""Who?"" and possibly, ""Why?""
That is remark"
"Kamala Harris’s broadside against Joe Biden’s record on busing during last week’s Democratic presidential debate has done more than just re-energize the California senator’s presidential campaign.
Experts who study the country's school system say Harris renewed attention on an issue still roiling America's public schools in a way that hasn't been seen in decades. And the 2020 presidential candidates are divided about how they feel about the continuing practice of trying to integrate the education system by moving diverse kids from one part of town to another to get an..."
"They've known for months that Congress would face a late February deadline to keep the Department of Homeland Security running.
Yet the top Republican leaders in Congress -- House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- haven't talked to each other for two weeks until Wednesday.
That revelation was a clear sign that Congress is on the verge of letting the agency run out of money at the end of the day on Friday, furloughing some workers while requiring other to show up to work without being..."
"The Senate made its first move on Wednesday to prevent a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, with just two days remaining until the agency runs out of money.
The upper chamber voted 98-2 on a procedural hurdle that would pave the way for a ""clean"" funding bill to be brought to the floor, following a deal announced by Senate Democratic leaders earlier in the day. Only Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) voted against moving forward with the agreement, which would fund DHS without any measures..."
"Tensions between the U.S. and China have flared in recent days as the Biden administration rebuked Beijing for its military aggression against Taiwan, prompting a fierce backlash from Chinese officials.
The verbal sparring serves as a stark illustration of China's mounting aggression against its neighbors and highlights President Joe Biden's quandary as he tries to counter China's military expansion.
Some experts fear that if the brewing ""cold war"" between Washington and Beijing turns hot, Taiwan will be the spark. China views Taiwan as part of its territory; Taiwan sees itself as an..."
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday signaled that he wanted to ease up on coronavirus-related restrictions in a matter of weeks, even as his top experts say it could take months for life to go back to normal.
""I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" Trump said during a Fox News town-hall event at the White House. Easter is on April 12, in 19 days.

"David McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, conceded the exceedingly close race for the Republican nomination for Senate in Pennsylvania on Friday to Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity television physician, with a statewide recount underway and no official race call.
Dr. Oz had a lead of fewer than 1,000 votes, or .07 percent, before the county-by-county recount began last week. The unexpected early concession — five days before the recount’s full results were to be released — was a recognition that Mr. McCormick had gained only handfuls of votes so..."
"The Senate — in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote on Thursday — sent Congress’s strongest message yet condemning anti-Asian hate crimes by passing a bill aimed at improving data collection.
The legislation, while somewhat narrow, intends to bolster hate crime tracking by designating a Justice Department official to specifically review potential hate crime incidents, providing grants for regional law enforcement agencies to set up reporting hotlines, and offering training to police on how to handle hate crime response.
It ultimately passed 94-1 with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) as the lone vote..."
"Capping nearly two weeks of talks between Democrats and Republicans, the Senate approved legislation on Thursday to ramp up law enforcement efforts to better protect the Asian American and Pacific Islander community from hate crimes.
The move marks a rare moment of bipartisan unity needed to approve the Senate legislation despite a new political era marked by increasingly bitter party divisions.
The bill, which needed 60 votes for passage in the evenly divided Senate, was approved by a 94-1 vote. Only GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voted no.

"The bitter and increasingly tight contest between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden turned on a handful of battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, dashing hopes for a decisive victory for either candidate.
Trump was projected to win the battleground states of Florida and Texas while the Democratic former vice president secured an early lead in Arizona. But many states remained up for grabs early Wednesday as ballots were being counted, and some state officials began to signal the tallying would continue well into the day.
Democrats' hope..."
"With millions of votes yet to be counted, President Trump falsely asserted election fraud, pledged to mount a legal challenge to official state results and made a premature claim of victory. In remarks at the White House early Wednesday, Trump claimed that he’d won several states that are still counting ballots, including Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
His Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, insisted earlier that “we believe we’re on track to win this election,” citing Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where votes were still being tallied in a bitterly contested presidential..."
"Now that his massive coronavirus relief package is law, President Joe Biden is laying out his next big proposal: A roughly $2 trillion plan for improving the nation's infrastructure and shifting to greener energy over the next 8 years.
He is set to unveil the effort, dubbed the American Jobs Plan, on Wednesday at an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania -- the opening move in what's expected to be a months-long negotiation with Congress.
The nation's infrastructure is sorely in need of repair. It recently earned a C- score from the..."
"It was a stunning rout.  
A year ago Monday, a ragtag army of extremists swept into Kabul without firing a shot after having seized most of Afghanistan. After spending trillions on military and humanitarian aid, the two-decade U.S.-led international campaign to remake the desperately poor and violence-ridden country was over.
Western nations raced to depart in a largely chaotic and embarrassing exit, and the victorious Taliban, whose previous government was toppled in the aftermath of 9/11 after refusing to hand over the author of the attack, Osama bin Laden, promised to form an “open, inclusive Islamic government.” 
Instead,..."
"In a moment of unrestrained demagoguery, President Donald Trump presided Wednesday over a crowd chanting ""Send her back! Send her back!"" about an American Muslim congresswoman who he targeted with racist attacks.
The scenes at a North Carolina rally provided an ugly overture to a 2020 election campaign already soaked in hate. They exemplified the tribal politics and white nationalism that Trump is making clear he plans to ride to reelection, no matter their impact on America's fragile societal harmony.
The chants of ""Send her back!"" referred to Somalia-born, American..."
"The 2016 Democratic primary moved inexorably toward its conclusion Tuesday night, with Hillary Clinton stopping just short of declaring victory and Bernie Sanders declining to concede.
For Clinton, double-digit victories across the battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio provided deliverance from a humbling loss in Michigan a week earlier and finally gave her the space to begin her pivot to Donald Trump and the general election. That left the Vermont senator to deliver his stan"
"Tuesday night was an amazing night for Hillary Clinton, and not just because her wins in Florida and Ohio made Bernie Sanders's path to the nomination nearly impossible.
Tuesday night was an amazing night for Hillary Clinton because Marco Rubio dropped out of the race and virtually ensured she will face either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in the general election.
A couple of months ago, Rubio's general-election strength was conventional wisdom. ""I sometimes want to run"
"Last June, President Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday, proclaiming it as a day for all Americans to commemorate the end of slavery.
One year later, only 18 states have passed legislation that would provide funding to let state employees observe the day as a paid state holiday, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Opponents of bills that would create funding for the permanent holiday have complained of the costs associated with giving workers another paid day off. Some have said that not enough people know about the holiday to make the..."
"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is seriously considering a possible independent presidential run and is looking at making a decision sometime in March, a source familiar with Bloomberg's thinking told CNN on Saturday.
The source said aides to the three-term mayor are looking at ballot access issues, but the source refused to speak specifically about what Bloomberg, 73, asked to be done."
"Michael R. Bloomberg has instructed advisers to draw up plans for a potential independent campaign in this year’s presidential race. His advisers and associates said he was galled by Donald J. Trump’s dominance of the Republican field, and troubled by Hillary Clinton’s stumbles and the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the Democratic side.
Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has in the past contemplated running for the White House on a third-party ticket, but always concluded he could not win. A confluence of..."
"The US National Archives confirmed on Friday that officials found classified materials in boxes of documents Donald Trump improperly removed from the White House – and that they had alerted the Department of Justice (DoJ).
The disclosure is expected to escalate an investigation by the House oversight committee into whether Trump violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978 by removing and destroying White House documents.
In a letter to the committee, David Ferriero, of the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara), said it had “identified items marked as classified national security information in the boxes”."
"US employers added a solid 128,000 jobs in October, a figure that was held down by a now-settled strike against General Motors that caused several thousand workers to be temporarily counted as unemployed.
The labor department says the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.5% to 3.6%, still near a five-decade low. For the second straight month, average hourly wages rose 3% from a year ago."
"More people flew out of airports in the United States on Sunday — 2.46 million according to the Transportation Security Administration — than on any other day so far this year. The Fourth of July holiday is expected to be even busier, with Hopper, a travel booking app, predicting that nearly 13 million passengers will fly to, from and within the United States this weekend.
The question for many travelers is whether they can trust airlines to get them where they want to go on time."

"Fireworks manufacturers have been on something of a winning streak of late: Sales of both low-and high-grade celebratory explosives in the U.S. are projected to top $1 billion this year; more states than ever now allow consumers to buy sparklers, Roman candles and other do-it-yourself pyrotechnics. Obscure regulations are being scaled back to help light up the country's summertime skies."
"On Friday morning, the third day in his four-day New England campaign swing, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson told a joke. He was the punch line.

"Illinois authorities have determined the AR-15 rifle used to kill two people and injure a third during unrest in Kenosha was purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin, and that Kyle Rittenhouse never possessed it in Illinois.
That bit of information came from the Lake County State's Attorney's Office in a news release issued Tuesday. The release said police in Antioch, Rittenhouse's hometown — and where he turned himself in — investigated any possible crimes Rittenhouse may have committed in Illinois, but found none."
"“That” was Donald J. Trump’s inaugural news conference as a duly elected United States president-to-be, in which he called BuzzFeed a “failing pile of garbage,” called CNN “fake news” and more or less told the whole lot of reporters at Trump Tower to stuff it when it comes to his unreleased tax returns because everyday Americans don’t care and, anyway, “I won.”"
"The media is sinking to Donald Trump's level.
Reeling from their inability to stop his election, envious of his power to make people believe his most ridiculous statements, and rinsed by a needy mood for self-soothing, the media and other American institutions are greeting the era of Trump by lowering their ethical and professional standards and indulging in attention-seeking hysteria."
"Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland died early Tuesday due to complications stemming from longtime health issues, the Democratic leader’s office announced. He was 68. Cummings, who has played a high-profile role in a myriad of investigations into President Donald Trump as the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, underwent a medical procedure last month but had not yet returned to his office this week when the House was back in session.

"President Obamas campaign is working feverishly to restore its momentum after a lackluster debate performance last week, an effort that began with a conference call 10 minutes before the debate even ended and led to new advertisements, a rewritten stump speech, a carefully timed leak and a reversal of months-old strategy."
"The Supreme Court will allow Texas to enforce its new voter ID law in next month’s election, the court said in an unusual Saturday morning order.
Rejecting requests from the Obama administration and civil rights groups, the justices declined to re-impose an injunction against the law granted last week by a district court judge but lifted Tuesday by the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals."
"The Supreme Court on Saturday allowed Texas to use its strict voter identification law in the November election. The court’s order, issued just after 5 a.m., was unsigned and contained no reasoning.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a six-page dissent saying the court’s action “risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters.”
Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent.
The law, enacted in 2011, requires voters seeking to cast their ballots at the polls to present photo identification like a Texas driver’s or..."

"Recreational marijuana is now roughly six months away from being legal across Illinois.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the bill into law Tuesday.
That means residents 21 and over will be able to buy marijuana at dispensaries as soon as Jan. 1.
Illinois now joins 10 other states that have legalized recreational marijuana.
In Vermont and Washington, D.C., cannabis possession and cultivation is legal but sales are not regulated. Illinois and Vermont both legalized the drug through the legislative process, and not via a ballot initiative."

First House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) bragged that Gowdy’s committee had succeeded in bringing down Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers in her bid for the White House. Then New York House Republican Richard Hanna confirmed the same partisan purpose of Gowdy’s committee: “This may not be politically correct,” he said during a radio interview last week, “ but I think there is a big part of this..."

"Since she became the first female minority governor of South Carolina six years ago, Nikki Haley has been on the shortlist of Republican state officials with possible national futures.

"President Barack Obama on Monday repeated his call for deficit reduction but warned against the potentially catastrophic effect on the economy by tying cuts to raising the debt ceiling.
“While Im willing to compromise and find common ground over how to reduce our deficit, America cannot afford another debate with this Congress over how to pay the bills theyve already racked up, Obama said in the East Room of the White House at what aides have billed as the final news conference of his first term. “To even entertain..."
"At a news conference dominated by discussion of what's expected to be Washington's next big political battle, President Obama insisted Monday that he will not let Republicans tie an increase in the federal government's borrowing limit to negotiations over cuts in future federal spending.

The tension between the two men -- Barr, the public face of the Justice Department, and Mueller, an outwardly silent figure who's spoken publicly only through written documents -- has been building for weeks and was on full display Wednesday as the attorney general testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Barr's final two minutes of testimony before the Judiciary Committee prompted him to call Mueller's March 27 letter criticizing Barr's..."
"The economy continued to advance at a sturdy pace in July, the government reported Friday, creating 209,000 jobs and adding to a string of generally positive economic reports in recent weeks pointing to an improved outlook after years of lackluster post-recession growth.
At the same time, last month’s job gains were lower than in recent months and less than Wall Street had expected, helping to calm fears that the economy was about to accelerate to a point where the Federal Reserve might decide to start raising interest rates earlier than..."

That's the word, and the concept, that Mitt Romney's campaign is emphasizing in response to the Obama campaign's new attacks on Romney's tax plan.
President Obama is seizing on a new think-tank study that says Romney's plan to cut tax rates for all brackets, lower the corporate rate, close loopholes and keep taxes low on investments, would require him to eliminate deductions and credits that benefit the lower- and middle-class, such as child credits and mortgage deductions.
The Romney campaign is not engaging on the same playing field. When..."
"A day before the Labor Department releases jobs figures for July, the dueling presidential campaigns turned their attention back to the nation's fragile economy, each blasting the other as bad for middle class Americans.
President Barack Obama's campaign used a 30-second television ad to hit Mitt Romney for his tax plan, saying in the spot that his Republican challenger's proposals would increase taxes on middle class Americans while lowering tax rates for the wealthy. The campaign said the ad would run in New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida,"

"In the moment before Jada Pinkett Smith’s husband strode onstage to slap another man during Sunday night’s Oscars ceremony, the camera panned briefly to her face. Comedian Chris Rock had just made a joke at her expense, and she did not appear happy. She rolled her eyes. She clasped her hands tightly in her lap. She sat ramrod straight, wearing a high-necked emerald gown — there was almost a genteel Victorian sensibility to her restrained displeasure.
Pinkett Smith’s reaction to the joke potentially contained multitudes: Embarrassment? Irritation? Self-consciousness? But instead..."

""Anybody wants to run for president, they can. That doesn’t mean they’ll have my vote,"" Coburn told a handful of reporters just off the Senate floor.
""I don't think we need another Bush. Period. And I like them all. But I don’t think we need another Bush,"" Coburn said.
He was far more..."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the U.N. Security Council that the Russian military must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes.
In a video appearance Tuesday, Zelenskyy accused the Kremlin’s troops of the worst atrocities since World War II and said they are no different from other terrorists like the Islamic State extremist group.
The Ukrainian leader made his plea via video Tuesday as grisly evidence continued to emerge of civilian massacres carried out by Russian forces on the outskirts of Kyiv.
The images, particularly from the town..."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the U.N. Security Council to seek “full accountability” for the actions of Russian forces in Ukraine, which he described as the “most terrible war crimes” since World War II. In a video address, he accused Russia of mass atrocities across the country, including killing unarmed civilians and crushing people with tanks.
“This undermines the whole architecture of global security,” Zelensky said. “They are destroying everything.”
Prior to those remarks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the alleged actions in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha..."
"Twitter has notified employees that it will be “reducing our global workforce” on Friday, November 4th, according to an unsigned internal memo seen by The Verge.
The confirmation comes a week after Elon Musk became Twitter’s new owner and quickly started changing how the company operates and its product roadmap. Since then, speculation about the timing and scope of the expected layoffs has run rampant inside Twitter.
Employees will receive an email by 9AM PST on November 4th confirming whether they have been laid off or not, according to the internal memo, which also..."
"WASHINGTON ― Democrats on Capitol Hill are preparing to push through a large coronavirus relief package ― without Republican support, if necessary ― in order to confront what they’re calling a historic health and economic crisis in America.
“Only big, bold action is called for,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Thursday, pledging to “move forward” and pass a bill even if Republicans object to the measure.
Democrats can muscle through spending legislation with only 51 votes in the Senate through a special..."
"He threatened any country that interfered in his invasion of Ukraine with “consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” He placed his nuclear forces on high alert and held exercises with them. And then he proclaimed that Western sanctions amounted to a “declaration of war” against Russia.
The fate of humanity suddenly seems to be in the unsteady hands of an isolated, frustrated, and potentially unhinged Vladimir Putin. And people are understandably panicked about that prospect. “The fact that there’s a very short path from, say, Putin feeling humiliated to the end of life as we know it,” the sociologist Kieran Healy wrote, “is..."
"Florida on Sunday reported more than 15,000 new coronavirus cases, smashing the daily record reported by any single state and once again putting an international spotlight on a place that does not have the virus under control.
The eye-popping topline figure does come with some caveats.
The Florida Department of Health received 135,992 results from people who have never been tested before, and 15,299 of those tests came back positive for Covid-19. The positivity rate of new infections was 11.25 percent, which is at least a two-week low and down..."
"The Biden administration proposed new standards Tuesday that could make it more difficult to classify millions of workers as independent contractors and deny them minimum wage and benefits.
The U.S. Department of Labor rule, which could take months to take effect, would replace a scrapped Trump-era standard that had lowered the bar for classifying employees as contractors, workers who are not covered by federal minimum wage laws and are not entitled to benefits including health insurance and paid sick days.
The reaction in markets for major gig companies was immediate...."

"Investigators combed through social media and backtracked through the life of the gunman whose rampage left four Marines dead, seeking clues Friday on how a popular engineering student drifted to apparent despair in a world he described as a “prison.”
While no clear motive has been determined for Thursday’s bloodshed in Chattanooga, the probe delved into possible ties to Islamist terrorist groups or whether the attacker — 24-year-old Mohammad Youssef Abdul­azeez — acted independently in a half-hour spree of violence that ended with his death by apparent police gunfire."
"A day after a gunman opened fire at two military centers in Chattanooga, Tenn., and killed four Marines, authorities are trying to answer the big question: Why?
At a late-night press conference, authorities said they had yet to pin down a motive. But earlier, officials identified the shooter as 24-year-old Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, who died during the course of the attack."
"Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) has mustered the 30 votes necessary to force a vote on the FCC’s decision to repeal net neutrality. Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) announced that she’s signed onto Markey’s request to overturn the new rules, under the Congressional Review Act — which lets Congress nullify recently passed regulations with a simple majority."
"Joe Biden has told Barack Obama he will run for re-election in 2024, according to a Washington website, the Hill.
The site cited two anonymous sources. One was quoted as saying Biden “wants to run and he’s clearly letting everyone know”.
It was not clear when Biden told Obama his plans. But Obama visited the White House earlier this month, to celebrate the Affordable Care Act.
Introducing his host, Obama called him “Vice-President Biden”.
“That was a joke,” he said, to laughter.
Biden was vice-president to Obama from 2009 to 2017. He won the..."
"NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) ― Two dozen U.S. states and municipalities sued the Trump administration on Tuesday to stop it from enforcing a rule that would make it easier for doctors and nurses to avoid performing abortions on religious or moral grounds.
A lawsuit led by New York Attorney General Letitia James said the expanded “conscience” protections could undermine the ability of states and cities to provide effective healthcare without jeopardizing billions of dollars a year in federal aid."
"The most famous scientist in America is facing retirement.
After more than five decades of federal service under seven presidents, Anthony Fauci says he’s leaving by the end of President Joe Biden’s term.

Trump added:..."
"President Donald Trump threatened Monday to pull the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina if the state’s Democratic governor doesn’t immediately sign off on allowing a full-capacity gathering in August despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump’s tweets about the upcoming RNC in Charlotte come two days after North Carolina’s largest daily increase in virus cases yet.
On Friday, Gov. Roy Cooper moved the state into a second reopening phase by loosening restrictions on hair salons, barbers and restaurants. But he said the state must move cautiously, and he kept..."

"Thousands of protesters shut down Hong Kong’s international airport Monday, defying an intensifying police crackdown, as China issued ominous warnings that described the protests as “terrorism” and began massing a paramilitary force in a southern border city.
Some of the protesters who had been occupying the airport’s arrivals hall swarmed into the departures area Monday, prompting authorities to cancel all flights and advise travelers to leave one of the world’s busiest hubs.
The action came in response to a sharp increase in the level of force employed by Hong Kong’s..."
"President Biden made his way on Sunday around a quiet room at Dover Air Force Base, a chamber filled with couches and chairs, with dignitaries and grieving families huddling together as the president came to speak to them privately, one family at a time.
Mark Schmitz had told a military officer the night before that he wasn’t much interested in speaking to a president he did not vote for, one whose execution of the Afghan pullout he disdains — and one he now blames for the death of his 20-year-old..."
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will force a vote next Wednesday on advancing the bipartisan infrastructure package, a hardball tactic aimed at moving President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda forward before the August recess.
“Everyone has been having productive conversations and it’s important to keep the two-track process moving,” Schumer said in a floor speech Thursday. “All parties involved in the bipartisan infrastructure bill talks must now finalize their agreement so that the Senate can begin considering that legislation next week.”"
"Republican voters in Georgia ignored Donald Trump's endorsements in congressional primary runoffs for safe GOP House seats on Tuesday night, but sided with the Senate candidate in Alabama who had his blessing over one of the former President's earliest and most loyal supporters.
Tuesday's elections also set the matchups for several key House races in Virginia and Georgia. And in Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser won her Democratic primary and is now poised to win a third term.

Appearing with Fauci are Stephen Hahn,..."
"President Biden’s coronavirus response team warned Americans on Tuesday that they must do more to protect themselves against Covid-19, as the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant known as BA.5 fuels a new wave of infections, re-infections and hospitalizations across the country.
But their new strategy to combat the threat sounded a lot like the old one, couched as advice that they hope more people will follow: Get vaccinated or boosted even if you have already been infected; test if you feel sick; seek out therapeutics if you test positive and wear masks in..."
"MEXICO CITY — Mexican soldiers, armed police and migration officials blocked hundreds of migrants after they crossed the border from Guatemala in a caravan into southern Mexico on Wednesday, and detained dozens of them, a witness from a migrant aid group and an official said.
The Mexican response in the border town of Metapa, which included dozens of soldiers, marked a toughening of the government's efforts to curb the flow of mainly Central American migrants, said Salva Cruz, a coordinator with Fray Matias de Cordova.

"Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 is believed to have been hit by fire from a Russian-built Tor M-1 (SA-15) surface-to-air missile system operated by the Iranian military, according to multiple reports.
Pentagon officials told Newsweek that the incident was probably an accident, as anti-aircraft systems were likely active at the time of the suspected shoot down. The Pentagon could not confirm the report for Insider."
"The Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, western security officials believe.
UK sources told the Guardian that British officials had seen intelligence that suggested that the plane was hit by an Iranian air defence missile.
Western intelligence agencies are understood to have picked up signals of the missile launch, followed by the traces of an explosion. A British source said: “The assessment is that it looks like it is a tragic accident.” One report suggested..."
"The company behind a contentious oil pipeline that would have stretched between Canada and the United States has officially abandoned the project, months after US President Joe Biden revoked its permit.
In a statement on Wednesday, TC Energy said it had terminated the Keystone XL project “after a comprehensive review of its options” and in consultation with its partner, the government of Alberta, an oil-rich province in western Canada.
“The Company will continue to coordinate with regulators, stakeholders and Indigenous groups to meet its environmental and regulatory commitments and ensure a safe termination..."
Former Rep. Asa Hutchison (R-Ark.) on Tuesday released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association. The report commissioned in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting recommended properly trained armed employees to provide an important layer of security in schools.
"Late on Dec. 20, the Department of Justice sent a batch of documents to the Center for Public Integrity showing communications between the White House and the Pentagon regarding U.S. military aid to Ukraine.
The documents were delivered under court order after Public Integrity won a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Defense Department, seeking details on President Donald Trump’s delay of the aid after he pressed Ukraine’s prime minister to open investigations on the 2016 presidential election and former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter."
"New documents show President Donald Trump asked about U.S. military aid to Ukraine a month before the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that went on to trigger the impeachment investigation into Trump.
The heavily-redacted documents, obtained under a Freedom of Information request by the Center for Public Integrity, also show that administration officials ordered a hold on the aid about an hour after the leaders’ call on July 25."
"The Labor Department’s monthly jobs report has laid bare the devastating economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, showing that the U.S. unemployment rate hit 14.7 percent in April, with 20.5 million people put out of work. That shatters the the post-World War II record of 10.8 percent in November 1982. The rate was 4.4 percent in March, and the spike is a record on a month-to-month basis. The number of unemployed Americans was listed at 23.1 million. The number of people who usually work full-time dropped by 15 million over..."
"Nearly every claim made by Donald Trump and his allies in the Republican Party about Volume 1 of the Mueller Report—that copious volume that deals with accusations Trump or his campaign conspired with the Kremlin—has been false.
Trump and his advocates say Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy? That's not true. They say Mueller found no evidence of coordination? Also false. Mueller found no evidence of collusion? False. Mueller considered the facts from every angle but couldn't establish any conspiracy between Trump or his campaign and Russian nationals? False. Mueller..."
"After years of stagnant climate policy, months of excruciating political negotiations, and a marathon weekend of back-to-back voting, the Senate passed the Democrats’ sweeping climate and health care bill on Sunday. 
The estimated $740 billion package, entitled the Inflation Reduction Act, includes close to $400 billion in climate spending—by far the largest climate investment in the nation’s history. The plan would be largely paid for by new taxes, including a 15 percent minimum tax on the handful of corporations with annual profits about $1 billion.
The bill represents a fraction..."

Hundreds of people turned out to pay their respects at a public viewing at the church Monday afternoon. Memorial services were also..."
"WASHINGTON — Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said late Thursday that although he believed that Democrats had proved their case that President Trump acted “inappropriately” in his dealings with Ukraine, he did not think the president’s actions were impeachable and would vote against considering new evidence in the impeachment trial.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee will oppose calling more witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, all but dashing Democratic efforts to hear more testimony and pushing the Senate toward a vote to acquit Trump as soon as Friday.
A vote on witnesses, expected Friday, could lead to an abrupt end and assured acquittal in only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. Trump was pressing for action in time for his State of the Union address, and that now seems likely. As the Senate..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. warship on Thursday destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after it threatened the ship, President Donald Trump said. The incident marked a new escalation of tensions between the countries less than one month after Iran downed an American drone and Trump came close to retaliating with a military strike.
In remarks at the White House, Trump blamed Iran for a “provocative and hostile” action and said the U.S. responded in self-defense."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday said that a U.S. Navy ship ""destroyed"" an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz — the latest in a series of tense incidents between Washington and Tehran.
Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that the USS Boxer — a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship — “took defensive action” against the Iranian drone that had “closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards” and ignored “multiple calls to stand down.”
The drone was “threatening safety of the ship and the..."

"In April, Gov. Greg Abbott ordered state police to inspect every commercial vehicle entering Texas through a port of entry, saying the painful step was needed because the Biden administration was not doing its job to secure the border.
Drug cartels, Abbott said, were using “dangerous commercial trucks” to smuggle “immigrants, deadly fentanyl and other illegal cargo” into the state. The “enhanced commercial vehicle inspections” at the border caused hourslong delays at the inland ports, essentially grinding trade with Mexico to a halt and costing Texas businesses millions in losses.

"From the moment North American sports leagues announced their plans to start or restart their season while masked and sanitized and playing before eerily empty stands, the question wasn’t if some athletes would test positive for COVID-19, but when.
The second question was how many positives tests would be too many for that team — or a league — to continue playing. One? Probably not. A player could be isolated and replaced. Two? Still not many and not enough for everything to come crashing down, because rosters were expanded to..."
"President Biden formally announced his American Families Plan on Wednesday, a $1.8 trillion proposal to give all Americans access to community college, preschool, affordable child care and paid leave, among other initiatives. He wants to fund it by increasing taxes on the rich.
Supporters and detractors are already lining up, but most agree on this: It’s an ambitious plan. And it will be a challenge to get Congress to pass it, especially after the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that was enacted in March and Biden’s more than $2 trillion infrastructure..."
"Republicans seized control of the U.S. Senate and were on track to expand their grip on the House of Representatives and governorships in the 2014 elections, marking a dramatic midterm rout that cut deep into territory President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party won by commanding margins only two years ago.
With several Democratic-held Senate seats still up for grabs, the GOP has already captured more than the six seats required to take the upper chamber of Congress. Their candidates ousted Democratic incumbents in North Carolina, Arkansas and Colorado..."
"Resurgent Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday night, expanded their hold on the House, and defended some of the most closely contested governors’ races, in a repudiation of President Obama that will reorder the political map in his final years in office.
Propelled by economic dissatisfaction and anger toward the president, Republicans grabbed Democratic Senate seats in North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, West Virginia, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota to gain their first Senate majority since 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a shrewd Republican tactician, cruised to re-election..."
"As the world scrambles to contain the new variant, some are hopefully seizing on anecdotal reports from South Africa that it may cause only mild illness. But although previous variants of the coronavirus have been associated with different symptoms and severity, it would be dangerous to assume that Omicron is a viral pussy cat, experts say.
At a briefing convened by South Africa’s Department of Health on Monday, Unben Pillay, a GP from practising in Midrand on the outskirts of Johannesburg, said that while “it is still early days” the cases he..."
"The forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is not just the usual story of an administration racked by chaos and the short shelf life of almost everyone who works for an imperious and grudge-bearing President.
Nielsen was hardly a moderate out of step with President Donald Trump on his signature issue of immigration. She became the administration's public face of the zero-tolerance policy that caused widespread outrage after hundreds of migrant children were separated from their parents.
But she is nonetheless paying the price for a crisis exacerbated..."

Some restaurants, such as Burger King, are already selling versions of..."
"A white bar owner charged in the fatal shooting of a Black man during a protest in Nebraska in May — less than a week after the killing of George Floyd — has died by suicide, the man’s lawyer said on Sunday.
The bar owner, Jacob Gardner, was indicted by a grand jury on Sept. 15 in connection with the deadly confrontation with James Scurlock on May 30 in Omaha, one that initially appeared would not lead to criminal charges.
The case touched off large protests and prompted the appointment..."

"That his sexist manifesto even gained traction at the company suggests its workplace culture has a long way to go. On Saturday, Motherboard reported that an anti-diversity manifesto penned by James Damore, a software engineer at Google, had gone “internally viral” at the company—and then, after Gizmodo obtained and published the 10-page document, it went viral-viral. The screed aired its author’s qualms with diversity and inclusion initiatives at Google, programs he deemed a waste of time because women are inherently less suited for technical roles than men. Or as he..."
"Global hunger and the chronic inability to access food skyrocketed in 2021, with 2.3 billion people facing moderate or severe food insecurity around the world, the United Nations said in a report released Wednesday.
“The world is moving backward in its efforts to end hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms,” the report said, in part as a result of the war in Ukraine, which is disrupting supply chains and contributing to the rising prices in energy, grain and fertilizers."
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to block New York’s requirement that health care workers be vaccinated against the coronavirus even when they cite religious objections.
As is often the court’s practice in rulings on emergency applications, its unsigned order included no reasoning. But Justice Neil M. Gorsuch filed a 14-page dissent saying that the majority had betrayed the court’s commitment to religious liberty.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Justice Gorsuch’s dissent. Justice Clarence Thomas also said he would have blocked the vaccine requirement, but he gave no reasons...."
"Democrats have a lot riding on Tuesday’s primaries. The Republican primaries, that is.
Facing hurricane-force electoral headwinds in November, Democrats have launched an unprecedented effort to meddle in GOP nominating contests across the country, elevating extreme candidates and attacking Republican hopefuls they view as greater threats in the general election.
Tuesday’s races feature four races in which Democratic candidates or groups are seeking to influence Republican primary voters, including a more-than-$30-million effort in the Illinois governor’s race. There are also multi-million-dollar campaigns to boost far-right Republican statewide candidates in Colorado,..."
"A federal appeals court ruled in June that the government improperly diverted $2.5 billion of the Pentagon's counter-drug program money to build more than 100 miles of border wall.
The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear a challenge to the Trump administration's use of Pentagon money to build the southern border wall and also its appeal of a ruling that blocked the sending of asylum applicants to Mexico while they wait for their appeals to be heard.
A federal appeals court ruled in June that the government..."

"It's no secret that John Eastman, a Republican lawyer on Donald Trump's team in the aftermath of the former president's defeat, wrote an infamous memo intended to help overturn the results. What's less known is why Eastman thought his scheme would work.
As regular readers know, the GOP attorney was convinced that then-Vice President Mike Pence, rather than honor the results of the election, could exploit ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and set aside the Electoral College votes of seven states.
Eastman's scheme, obviously, didn't work — but that doesn't mean the..."
"Documents released by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday indicate that Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine is overall safe and highly effective — 86 percent — against the most severe outcomes of the illness.
The favorable review comes two days before a panel of independent advisers to the FDA is scheduled to discuss the company's application for emergency use. It is widely expected that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will vote to recommend authorization of the vaccine."
"As of 2022, rising inflation has become a shared trend worldwide. The overall inflation rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow to 12.2 per cent, and this is because many countries on the continent lack a sufficient central banking system, which in turn results in the manipulation of currency to achieve short-term economic goals. Furthermore, the global supply disruptions caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are also some of the major drivers responsible for inflation. In fact, prices are set to rise even further,..."
"The Wall Street Journal's Adam Entous dropped a huge story Tuesday morning: Israel acquired classified US information while spying on the Iranian nuclear negotiations, and leaked the stolen information about the emerging deal to American lawmakers in an attempt to sabotage the Obama administration's outreach to Tehran.
This is yet another disaster for US-Israel relations. But that's not because Israel acquired classified US information, which honestly isn't that surprising. What's really outrageous is that Israel used the information in a deliberate attempt to manipulate American politics."
"House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""shocked"" by a recent report that the Israeli government spied on Iranian nuclear talks and leaked information on the developing deal to lawmakers, and that he hadn't heard anything from the Israelis himself.
""I'm not sure what the information was. But I'm baffled by it,"" Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.
He said that ""no information (was) revealed to me whatsoever"" on the talks.
The number two House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer, also said he hadn't received any information from the..."
"To state the obvious, there’s never a good time for a pandemic. But among the things that make this a particularly bad time is that the United States is in the middle not only of a presidential election, but of the decennial census.

"ROME — The Vatican on Monday released its first extensive official document on gender theory, rejecting the notion that individuals can choose their own gender identity.
The document, issued by the Vatican department overseeing Catholic education, argued that increasing acceptance of fluid definitions of gender by schools and legal systems posed a threat to traditional families and ignored the natural differences between men and women.
It lamented “calls for public recognition of the right to choose one’s gender, and of a plurality of new types of unions, in direct contradiction..."
"The United States on Monday topped 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has reported a million more coronavirus cases and about 21,000 more deaths in just the past three weeks.
The grim milestone continues a trend that sees the U.S. reporting far more confirmed cases and higher numbers of coronavirus-related deaths than any other country in the world. Brazil and India both have more than 3.5 million cases and Russia has nearly 1 million, though critics have cast doubt..."
"Opinions on the decision reached by a grand jury last week not to indict the police officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown largely broke down along partisan lines, with many conservatives agreeing that Darren Wilson should not have faced a trial. But another grand jury's decision not to indict a New York City police officer who placed 43-year-old Eric Garner into a chokehold, resulting in his death, seems to be playing out much differently so far.
The fact that Garner's death was captured on video and that Officer Daniel Pantaleo..."
"Pharmacies and state governments in the United States have thrown away at least 15.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines since March 1, according to government data obtained by NBC News — a far larger number than previously known and still probably an undercount.
Four national pharmacy chains reported more than 1 million wasted doses each, according to data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in response to a public records request. Walgreens reported the most waste of any pharmacy, state or other vaccine provider, with nearly 2.6 million..."
"A slew of nations moved to stop air travel from southern Africa on Friday, and stocks plunged in Asia and Europe in reaction to news of a new, potentially more transmissible COVID-19 variant.
“The last thing we need is to bring in a new variant that will cause even more problems,” said German Health Minister Jens Spahn, amid a massive spike in cases in the 27-nation European Union.
Within a few days of the discovery of the new variant, it has already impacted on a jittery society that is sensitive..."
"South Africa's health minister announced Thursday the discovery of a new coronavirus variant that appears to be spreading rapidly in parts of the country.
""Initially it looked like some cluster outbreaks, but from yesterday, the indication came from our scientists from the Network of Genomic Surveillance that they were observing a new variant,"" Minister of Health Joe Phaahla said, stressing that it is currently unclear where the variant -- currently dubbed B.1.1.529 -- first emerged.
It has so far been detected in South Africa, Botswana and in a traveler to Hong Kong from South..."
"The Senate voted to end its debate over the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Sunday afternoon, a move that sets the stage for a final Senate floor vote for her confirmation on Monday.
Despite efforts by Democratic lawmakers to use procedural maneuvers to slow her appointment, Barrett is on track to be confirmed to the court just about a week before Election Day with almost unanimous support from Senate Republicans.
Republicans have moved quickly to seat Barrett on the court, following her nomination by..."
"Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter.
One of the world's richest men delivered a letter to the company with a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of Twitter for $54.20 each, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Thursday.
The letter, delivered Wednesday, amounts to an offer to take Twitter private, a move that would give Musk greater control of the company. The offer values Twitter at more than $40 billion.

"The House vote to censure Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona was the only appropriate thing for members of Congress to do. It signaled that violence and misogyny have no place in our politics -- and neither do politicians like Gosar who promote them. While all 221 House Democrats voted for censure, they were joined by only two of their Republican colleagues.
What prompted the vote was Gosar's tweet of a photoshopped anime video showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and attacking the President of the United..."
"In an address at Georgetown University in Washington, President Obama laid out a sweeping new plan to address climate change.
As expected, Obama said his plan seeks to cap the carbon emissions of power plants.

"Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a divisive arch-conservative and one of his nation’s most powerful and influential figures, has died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in western Japan, hospital officials said.
Abe, 67, was shot from behind minutes after he started his speech in Nara. He was airlifted to a hospital for emergency treatment but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was later pronounced dead despite emergency treatment that included massive blood transfusions, hospital officials said.
Police arrested the suspected gunman at the scene..."
"Former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe died on Friday after being shot at a campaign event, in an attack that shocked a country where gun violence is virtually nonexistent.
Abe, 67, was a towering political presence even after he stepped down as Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, and he was campaigning ahead of elections scheduled for Sunday. He had just begun a speech in the western city of Nara, near Kyoto, when gunfire was heard around 11:30 a.m. local time (10:30 p.m. Thursday ET).
Officials said that one person had been apprehended in relation to the shooting...."

"Mitt Romney's ""off-the-cuff"" remarks that nearly half of Americans are ""dependent"" on government and believe they are ""victims"" who are ""entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to-you-name-it,"" were widely publicized. This is in fact old saw for a certain kind of anti-government conservative. I have given talks deep in conservative territory where courteous memebers of the audience would come up to me afterwards and say they agree we should pay taxes for infrastructure but not for giveaways ""to those people."""
"Before a critical round of primaries on Tuesday, the Republican presidential field gathered for a debate in Florida, site of perhaps next week's most pivotal contest.
Here are the top takeaways from Thursday night's debate:
'Little Marco!' 'Lyin' Ted!' Not in this debate
You'd be forgiven if you assumed Thursday's debate would be something akin to a professional wrestling cagematch. After all, it was just a week ago that Trump was not-too-subtly defending his manhood in response to a recent jab from Marco Rubio about the size of his hands...."
"A week after one of the most unruly debates in modern political history, the four remaining contenders for the Republican presidential nomination engaged in a polite parsing of their differences Thursday night over radical Islam, Social Security and other weighty matters.
There was no discussion of genitals, no schoolyard taunts, no candidates screaming to be heard over the shouting of others.
The two hours on a stage at the University of Miami in Coral Gables was one of the lowest-key sessions since the early, friendlier days of the GOP contest..."
"In response to last year’s near-total (and temporarily blocked) abortion ban in Alabama, a state legislator has introduced a bill that would require a man to undergo a vasectomy, at his own expense, “within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.”
House Bill 238, introduced on Thursday by Rep. Rolanda Hollis (D) notes, “Under existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men.”

"A 19-year-old man was in custody in a series of shootings, including one broadcast on social media, that left four dead, three wounded and the city of Memphis on edge late Wednesday, police said.
The suspected shooter was identified by police as Ezekiel Dejuan Kelly. He was apprehended around 9:20 p.m., more than two hours after police issued an urgent warning that prompted calls for residents of the Tennessee city of around 630,000 to stay indoors.
Kelly was charged with first-degree murder early Thursday.

"Manipulated videos of Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made it seem as if she were stumbling over and slurring her words continued to spread across social media on Friday, fueled by President Trump’s feud with the Democratic leader.
One of the videos, which showed Ms. Pelosi speaking at a conference this week, appeared to be slowed down to make her speech sound continually garbled."
"The United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in action in the Ukraine war, according to senior American officials.
Ukrainian officials said they have killed approximately 12 generals on the front lines, a number that has astonished military analysts.
The targeting help is part of a classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine. That intelligence also includes anticipated Russian troop movements gleaned from recent American assessments of..."
"In the first such action in the nation, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a mandate Friday requiring all eligible public and private schoolchildren in California to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a policy the state expects to affect millions of students.
The mandate would take effect for grades 7 through 12 as soon as the semester following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s full approval of the vaccine for children ages 12 and older, Newsom said. Students in kindergarten through sixth grade would be phased in after the vaccine is formally approved..."
"California is the first state in the country that will require schoolchildren to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday.

The mandate will apply to all who receive in-person instruction, Newsom said, and will begin in the first school term that follows full authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine for children by the US Food and Drug Administration — either in January..."
"Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement in Istanbul on Friday to free more than 20 million metric tons of grain stuck in blockaded Black Sea ports in Ukraine, a deal aimed at bringing down soaring grain prices and alleviating a mounting global hunger crisis.
The breakthrough comes after months of talks and was brokered with the help of the United Nations and Turkey. The agreement provides a method for exporting Ukrainian grain through Turkey, and it comes after the United Nations gave Russia assurances that it can export its grain..."
"After former President Donald Trump’s acquittal at his second Senate impeachment trial, bipartisan support appears to be growing for an independent Sept. 11-style commission into the deadly insurrection that took place at the U.S. Capitol.
Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Senate Rules Committee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to lead an immediate review of the Capitol’s security process.
Lawmakers from both parties, speaking on Sunday’s news shows, signaled that even more..."
"For more than five hours on Monday, the world got a taste of life without Facebook and its apps.
People in many places discovered that Facebook and its apps had burrowed their way into nearly every facet of existence.
In Mexico, politicians were cut off from their constituents. In Turkey, shopkeepers couldn’t sell their wares. And in Colombia, a nonprofit organization that uses WhatsApp to connect victims of gender-based violence to lifesaving services found its work impaired.
“Because we have a field team, we were able to mitigate some of..."

The rule, expected to go into effect on Tuesday, also applies to children who have crossed the border alone. The new rule will affect asylum seekers coming through..."
"On Thursday, #CancelNetflix trended on Twitter amid a new wave of calls to boycott the streaming service after a scene from the movie Cuties went viral.
The movie, about a group of eleven-year-old girls who form a twerking dance group, previously sparked controversy due to the sexualized poster used by Netflix to promote the movie.
Now, following its Netflix release, a scene from Cuties showing the girls dancing in a sexualized manner for an audience of adults has led to new calls for a boycott."
"Four state attorneys general are calling on Netflix to remove ""Cuties"" from the streaming service, saying the controversial film sexualizes young girls.
In a joint letter sent Monday, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton urged Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to pull the movie, saying ""Cuties"" is “fodder for those with criminal imaginations, serving to normalize the view that children are sexual beings.""

""We've got a guy I know fairly well,"" he later said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""He's not joking when he talks about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,..."
"Cat Thomas used to call herself politically independent. But she registered as a Democrat the moment she turned 18 this summer, fearful that Republicans in Pennsylvania would ban abortion.
Hope Pierotti, 20, hurried to re-register in her new swing-state home days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, similarly anxious about abortion rights. The procedure is legal in Pennsylvania, but Republicans could pass sweeping restrictions if they win the governor’s race and keep control of the statehouse.

Trump has called out TikTok as a national security threat as tensions worsen between his administration and the Chinese government."
"Oregon is the latest state to set plans to lift its statewide mask mandate for schools, following earlier announcements Monday from New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware.
The loosening guidelines are signs that the four states are changing how they manage the COVID-19 pandemic as cases from the omicron surge continue to subside.
Oregon health officials announced Monday its end date for indoor mask requirements for public places and inside schools is March 31.
""The evidence from Oregon and around the country is clear: masks save lives by slowing the spread..."
"As many states see declines in their daily Covid-19 case numbers and hospitalization rates, some have moved forward with plans to lift a significant mitigation measure: mask mandates in schools.
The moves go against guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the agency has remained mum about the states' decisions, simply telling CNN on Monday that it still recommends universal masking for all in schools.
However, some public health experts have questioned whether it's time for the CDC to update its school guidance, especially as the..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the US is ""going in the wrong direction"" as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise, particularly among unvaccinated Americans.
""If you look at the inflection of the curve of new cases and, as you said in the run-in to this interview, that it is among the unvaccinated.

"Stopovers at Scotland airport have tripled since 2015 and overnight stays in the area are up five-fold.
The U.S. Air Force has ordered a world-wide review of how it chooses overnight accommodations on long flights following revelations that air crews had occasionally stayed at President Donald Trump's Scotland resort while refueling at a small commercial airport nearby.
The review comes as additional instances of military personnel staying at Trump properties have been uncovered. The C-17 crew’s overnight stay at Trump’s Turnberry resort in Scotland earlier this year, first reported by..."

"President Donald Trump says he’s willing to help blue-state governors who are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks — but only if they’re willing to stop criticizing him in exchange.
“It’s a two-way street,” Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. “They have to treat us well, also. They can’t say, ‘Oh, gee, we should get this, we should get that.’”
Trump’s comments came as Andrew Cuomo — the Democratic governor of New York, the state currently at the heart of America’s coronavirus outbreak — pleaded with Trump to do more to..."
"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — At first, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tried to play nice. He limited criticisms of the federal government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and asked for medical supplies through official channels.
But nothing came, so he went on television. The first-term Democrat blasted the Trump administration on Sunday on CNN for failing to help states obtain masks, gloves and other protective gear.
It got President Donald Trump’s attention. After a Twitter feud and some mudslinging (Pritzker compared Trump to a “carnival barker”), the two got on the..."
"Around the midpoint of his first 100 days in office, President Biden is closing in on his first legislative triumph: congressional approval of his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.
After the Senate passed the plan on Saturday, it is set to return to the House for final approval as soon as Tuesday. It was also possible that the vote could slip to Wednesday depending on when the House received the sprawling measure from the Senate.
Whether the vote takes place Tuesday or Wednesday, it will still beat the March 14..."

"Libertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees.
Both are former Republican governors — Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts — and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues.
""We want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom, and the polling shows that a majority of Americans think..."
"In Gary Johnson’s first run for the presidency in 2012, as the Libertarian Party candidate, he won just under 1 percent of the popular vote. He did not surpass 3 percent in any state.
That’s not exactly a strong showing. But 2016 could prove more favorable because of the unpopularity of both major party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Mr. Johnson is at roughly 10 percent in recent polls, well above where he was in 2012. The question, of course, is whether it will have any impact.
Is This..."
"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday sought to lend credence to the partisan audit of presidential ballots cast in Arizona, holding his first rally there since the 2020 election.
Speaking in Phoenix at a Turning Point USA gathering, Trump hailed what he called Arizona Senate Republicans' “full forensic audit” of results in Maricopa County, while continuing to promulgate baseless conspiracy theories about the election he lost to Joe Biden.
“I predict when the votes come in … I think they’re going to be so horrible. They will be, in my..."
"Russia and Ukraine traded claims of rocket and artillery strikes at or near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant on Sunday, intensifying fears that the fighting could cause a massive radiation leak.
Ukraine’s atomic energy agency painted an ominous picture of the threat Sunday by issuing a map forecasting where radiation could spread from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Russian forces have controlled since soon after the war began.
Attacks were reported over the weekend not only in Russian-controlled territory adjacent to the plant along the left bank of the..."

"When Billy was working warehouse night shifts during the pandemic, he had a lot of free time. His responsibilities were straightforward, and basically just involved making sure everything was running as it should.
He was bored.
That's when the Ireland-based, 30-something decided to pivot from letting his mind be idle during work. Instead he turned to a list of books he wanted to read, but had never found the time — and started listening to audiobooks throughout the night."
"A federal district court has ruled that one abortion restriction passed by the Texas state Legislature over the summer is unconstitutional and has partially blocked another.
District Judge Lee Yeakel has blocked the state from enforcing a requirement that abortion-providing doctors obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals — a restriction that would have ended abortion services at one-third of the health centers currently providing them. He also blocked restrictions on the use of medication abortion. Both restrictions would have gone into effect on Tuesday."
"A federal judge has determined that new Texas abortion restrictions violate the U.S. Constitution, a ruling that keeps open — at least for now — dozens of abortion clinics that were set to halt operations Tuesday had key parts of the law taken effect.
In a decision released Monday that the state is certain to appeal, District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote that the regulations requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital creates an undue obstacle to women seeking an abortion.
""The admitting-privileges provision of House Bill 2..."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed an executive order Friday that prohibits schools in the state from requiring students to wear face masks when they return to classrooms in the fall.
The executive order, released Friday, is ""effective immediately"" and directs the Florida Departments of Health and Education to release emergency rules that stipulate that decisions over whether students will be masked in classrooms will be left up to parents rather than school officials.
According to the order, schools that do not comply with the directives from the Education and..."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday barred local school districts from requiring students to wear masks even as the nation fights a resurgence of coronavirus.

"The Department of Homeland Security officially published a change to what’s known as the “public charge” rule on Monday that would make it much harder to apply for a green card or earn a visa. The new policy, which is set to go into effect in mid-October, expands the definition of what would make an applicant likely to become a “public charge,” someone who the government has deemed would be dependent on it, thus rendering them ineligible for legal permanent residency status."
"President Barack Obama, after urging Congress to take a “prompt” vote authorizing military action against Syria, won endorsement for the cause from House Speaker John Boehner.
Backing from Republican Boehner brings Obama closer to overcoming objections being raised by some House members who’ve questioned the evidence presented by the administration that the Syrian government was behind a sarin gas attack last month or whether the U.S. has a vital interest in the region."
"President Obama said Tuesday he believes Congress will vote to authorize military action against Syria over the use of chemical weapons, and he won the support of the top two Republicans in the U.S. House.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said after a White House meeting that he supports the president's ""call for action"" against Syria, and he believes most other congressional Republicans will do so as well."
"Speaker John A. Boehner said on Tuesday that he would “support the president’s call to action” in Syria after meeting with President Obama, giving the president a crucial ally in the quest for votes in the House.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, quickly joined Mr. Boehner to say he also backed Mr. Obama."
"U.S. President Joe Biden declared Tuesday he is sticking to his Aug. 31 deadline for completing a risky airlift of Americans, endangered Afghans and others seeking to escape Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The decision defies allied leaders who want to give the evacuation more time, and opens Biden to criticism that he caved to Taliban deadline demands.
“Every day we’re on the ground is another day that we know ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both us and allied forces and innocent civilians,” Biden said at the White House,..."
"Herman Cain’s chances to win confirmation to the Federal Reserve plummeted on Thursday as at least four Republican senators indicated they would not back President Trump’s choice to fill a Fed seat.
Those defections would be enough to defeat Mr. Cain in a divided Senate, should Mr. Trump follow through with his plans to formally nominate him.
Mr. Cain, a former pizza magnate whose 2012 presidential run was upended by claims of sexual harassment, is currently undergoing a background check and President Trump has said he will wait for that..."

"The economy added 4.8 million jobs last month, based on a survey taken mid-month, sending the unemployment rate down to 11.1 percent — a sign of how many businesses were scrambling to emerge from the depths of the recession.
But new data also released Thursday by the Labor Department showed that 1.4 million people filed unemployment claims for the first time last week as many businesses reversed themselves and closed again during the surge in coronavirus cases. This trend has not fallen off in recent weeks.
This marked the 15th..."
"A Russian court heading the investigation into Brittney Griner’s drug charge extended the American basketball star’s detention until May 19, according to a report by Russian state news agency TASS. With no indication whether she could be released then, the latest news means Griner, 31, will have spent more than three months, at least, in Russian custody."
"CIA Director William J. Burns held a secret meeting Monday in Kabul with the Taliban’s de facto leader, Abdul Ghani Baradar, in the highest-level face-to-face encounter between the Taliban and the Biden administration since the militants seized the Afghan capital, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.
President Biden dispatched his top spy, a veteran of the Foreign Service and the most decorated diplomat in his Cabinet, amid a frantic effort to evacuate people from Kabul international airport in what..."
"The director of the CIA met with the Taliban’s top political leader in Kabul, an official said Tuesday, as more reports emerged of abuses in areas held by the fighters, fueling concerns about Afghanistan’s future and the fate of those racing to leave the country before the looming U.S. withdrawal.
Recent days have seen a flurry of efforts to speed a chaotic evacuation of foreigners and vulnerable Afghans from Kabul’s airport, where scenes of desperation have highlighted both the disarray of the American pullout and fears that the Taliban will..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday announced that it had deadlocked in a case challenging 
President Obama
’s plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation and allow them to work. The 4-4 tie left in place an appeals court ruling blocking the plan, dealing a sharp blow to an ambitious program that Mr. Obama had hoped would become one of his central legacies. Instead, even as the court deadlocked, it amplified the already contentious election-year debate over the nation’s immigration policy and..."
"WASHINGTON — Congress is trying to rush $4.5 billion in emergency humanitarian aid to the southwestern border while placing new restrictions on President Trump’s immigration crackdown, spurred on by disturbing images of suffering migrant families and of children living in squalor in overcrowded detention facilities.
But with a House vote on the package planned for Tuesday, some Democrats are revolting over the measure, fearing that the aid will be used to carry out Mr. Trump’s aggressive tactics, including deportation raids that he has promised will begin within two weeks. Republicans..."
"J.D. Vance, the author and first-time candidate who nabbed former President Donald Trump’s endorsement, won Ohio’s GOP Senate primary on Tuesday, settling a tumultuous race for the Republican nomination.
Vance’s campaign had stagnated until last month, when Trump made his pick in Ohio’s crowded contest. The move bumped the “Hillbilly Elegy” author out ahead of his opponents, including Josh Mandel, a former state treasurer and the far-right evangelical candidate, and state Sen. Matt Dolan, a moderate who refused to kiss Trump’s ring.
Ohio’s GOP Senate primary was the first major test of Trump’s..."
"Average daily new coronavirus cases in the United States dipped below 100,000 in recent days for the first time in months, but experts cautioned Sunday that infections remain high and precautions to slow the pandemic must remain in place.
The seven-day rolling average of new infections was well above 200,000 for much of December and went to roughly 250,000 in January, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University, as the pandemic came roaring back after it had been tamed in some places over the summer.
That average dropped below..."
"Hold on to that mask — it’s way too soon to ease mandates requiring face coverings, the new head of the CDC said Sunday.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted the country is still seeing about 100,000 new COVID cases per day and up to 3,500 daily deaths.
“The cases are more than two-and-a-half-fold times what we saw over the summer,” Walensky told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s encouraging to see these trends coming down, but they’re coming down from an extraordinarily high place.”..."
"Midway through the 2022 primary season, many Democratic lawmakers and party officials are venting their frustrations with President Biden’s struggle to advance the bulk of his agenda, doubting his ability to rescue the party from a predicted midterm trouncing and increasingly viewing him as an anchor that should be cut loose in 2024.
As the challenges facing the nation mount and fatigued base voters show low enthusiasm, Democrats in union meetings, the back rooms of Capitol Hill and party gatherings from coast to coast are quietly worrying about Mr. Biden’s leadership, his age and his capability..."
"The White House hit back at Republicans in an uncharacteristic manner Thursday by using its Twitter account to go after GOP lawmakers who are bashing President Joe Biden's move to cancel some student debt after they personally benefited from having Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven during the Covid pandemic.
In a series of tweets, the White House highlighted several congressional Republicans — Reps. Vern Buchanan of Florida, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, and Markwayne Mullin and Kevin Hern of Oklahoma — who it said had six- and seven-figure PPP loans forgiven..."
"Joe Biden has become the first US president declare formal recognition of the Armenian genocide, more than a century after the mass killings by Ottoman troops and opening a rift between the new US administration and Ankara.
“The American people honour all those Armenians who perished in the genocide that began 106 years ago today,” Biden said in a statement on Saturday.
“Beginning on 24 April 1915 with the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople by Ottoman authorities, one and a half million Armenians were deported, massacred..."
"Abortion rights are front and center at the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, but not the way most people expected. The focus will not be on abortion rights, per se, but on the controversial Texas law designed to prevent court challenges.
At issue is whether a state can nullify a constitutional right — in this case the right to abortion — by delegating enforcement not to state officials, but to private citizens who are authorized to sue abortion providers and anyone else who aids or abets an abortion.
This is..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday is taking up two challenges to the nation's most restrictive abortion law: the Texas measure that has all but stopped abortions in the state.
The court's decision to consider the issue on an unusually accelerated schedule ramps up the drama over abortion, as the justices prepare to hear an even more consequential case a month from now. On Dec. 1, Mississippi will urge the court to overrule Roe v. Wade and declare that there is no constitutional right to abortion.
The cases Monday involve two challenges to the..."
"Ukrainian officials say they have photographic proof that Russian forces are operating in eastern Ukraine.
A dossier obtained Monday by CNN shows what Ukrainian officials say are images of well-equipped gunmen operating in eastern Ukraine who look similar to photographs of Russian forces taken in Crimea, Russia and during Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia."
"For two weeks, the mysteriously well-armed, professional gunmen known as “green men” have seized Ukrainian government sites in town after town, igniting a brush fire of separatist unrest across eastern Ukraine. Strenuous denials from the Kremlin have closely followed each accusation by Ukrainian officials that the world was witnessing a stealthy invasion by Russian forces."
"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cannot be legally extradited to the United States to face espionage charges because of concerns over his fragile mental health and the risk of suicide, a British court ruled Monday.
Lawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government have already said they will appeal.
District Judge Vanessa Baraitser delivered her decision at London's Old Bailey court in a case that has pitted national security against freedom of expression. A crowd of reporters gathered outside as a small group of supporters chanted ""Free Julian Assange."""
"American detainee Jeffrey Fowle has been released from North Korea, nearly six months after he was taken into custody on charges of leaving a Bible in a nightclub, the State Department said Tuesday. Two other Americans who have been tried and convicted of crimes in North Korea are still being held.
Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg, Ohio, had been awaiting trial on charges of leaving a Bible at a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin last May. He was flown out of North Korea on a U.S. government jet..."
"The North Korean government has released Jeffrey Fowle, one of three Americans being held captive there, the White House confirmed Tuesday.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the United States welcomes the decision, but also called on North Korea to release two other Americans, Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae. ""The United States government will continue to work actively on their cases,"" he said.
Fowle, a 56-year-old city worker from Miamisburg, Ohio, traveled to North Korea in April on a tourist visa and was detained by state police in May..."
"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on Monday engaged in a mutual admiration exchange with the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), expressed support for restoring elements of the filibuster and suggested that Republicans might win control of the House or Senate in the midterm elections.
Several Democrats were unhappy, criticizing not only her remarks but her timing.
Sinema made the comments during a speech at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville, speaking and answering questions at the invitation of McConnell. There, McConnell effusively praised Sinema in his introduction, saying..."
"Voters on Tuesday took part in the city’s first mayoral election using ranked-choice voting, a system that may delay the declaration of a winner until mid-July.
Eric Adams, who ran for mayor of New York City on a message intensely focused on issues of public safety, emerged on Tuesday with a substantial lead in the Democratic primary, but fell well short of outright victory in a race that will now usher in a new period of uncertainty.
With 82 percent of the results in, Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president,..."
"Eric Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president and former police captain, is waking up Wednesday in the lead to be New York City's next mayor, but even though voting is done, the race is far from over.
It may take several weeks to find out who won the Democratic primary for mayor, with absentee ballots still trickling in and a new ranked choice voting system allowing New Yorkers to list their top five preferences for mayor.
No candidate won an outright majority in the election Tuesday, so the ranked choice preferences of..."
"The nation may not have to wait much longer to learn the future plans of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state who's considered the leading Democrat for the 2016 presidential race.
In a Wednesday interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, who named the former first lady the ""Most Fascinating Person of 2013,"" Clinton said she hadn't yet made up her mind on a presidential run. She assured Walters her announcement would come soon.
""Obviously, I will look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision..."
"Sunday night, I sat in the ballroom of a Miami resort and watched Florida governor Ron DeSantis tell the crowd about how Texas governor Greg Abbott had been sending busloads of migrants* to Washington, D.C. His envy was undisguised. Stunts like this, which use humans as props for a set piece about owning the libs, are the trademark of his own governing style. (He has done this with ex-felons, splashily arresting 20 and charging them with fraud.) You could almost see the wheels turning in his head.
Last night, DeSantis pulled off the stunt...."
"The Justice Department asked a federal judge on Thursday to revisit her decision to temporarily stop prosecutors from gaining access to classified documents seized from former President Donald J. Trump’s Florida home, arguing that her ruling was hindering the government’s effort to determine whether national security had been compromised.
In a pair of filings in federal court, lawyers for the department announced their intention to appeal key parts of Judge Aileen M. Cannon’s ruling. They said they would ask an appeals court to block those sections of her order if..."
"Senate Democrats are expected to introduce a revised version of the Respect for Marriage Act this week. The bill, which would enshrine same-sex marriage rights into law, will need support from at least 10 Republican senators in order to become law.
“We’re confident that we’ll have the votes when it comes to the floor. We’ve been guaranteed that this is going to come up before January,” an unnamed person, identified as being “close to negotiations,” told the international news outlet Semafor."
"President Trump — who gleefully questioned President Barack Obama’s birthplace for years without evidence, long insisted on the guilt of the Central Park Five despite exonerating proof and claimed that millions of illegal ballots cost him the popular vote in 2016 — wanted to have a word with the American public about accuracy in reporting."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took aim at California after Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a federal investigation into DeSantis' actions. 
""The governor of California sent a letter to the Department of Justice to investigate Texas and Florida governors and all I can say is, I think his hair gel is interfering with his brain function,"" the Florida governor said.
In response, Newsom challenged DeSantis to a debate before Election Day.

"The U.S. labor market added 315,000 jobs in August, hitting a 20-month streak in strong job growth that’s powering an economy through ominously high inflation.
The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 3.7 percent, according to a monthly jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, with 344,000 more people unemployed than the previous month.
The August jobs gains were the lowest monthly pick-up so far this year, but the labor market remains an area of strength for the economy, especially as the Federal Reserve raises interest..."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, once again found himself embroiled in a heated back-and-forth with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) during a Tuesday Senate coronavirus hearing, this time over accusations that he funded a Wuhan lab to develop COVID-19.
Paul, who signaled on Monday that he was going to grill Fauci on the subject, alleged that gain-of-function research to mutate animal viruses to infect humans at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been funded by the National Institutes of Health, something that Fauci strongly disputed. “With all..."
"WASHINGTON--Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's re-election campaign was rocked again Thursday as he issued a second apology after another instance of him in dark makeup was reported by the media. After a second picture and a video emerged of him wearing blackface, the Canadian politician asked for forgiveness.
At a campaign appearance in Winnipeg on Thursday, he apologized -- his second apology in as many days -- and added that “Darkening your face is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface. I should have understood that then,..."
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized again on Thursday for wearing blackface in three separate incidents and said he did not know how many times he had put on racist makeup.
""What I did hurt them, hurt people who shouldn't have to face intolerance and discrimination because of their identity. This is something I deeply, deeply regret,"" he said.
Darkening your face, he added, ""is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface. I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it.""
Trudeau still insisted..."
"There's no hyperbole in stating that the 2016 Hillary Clinton-vs.-Donald Trump presidential race has been the craziest we've covered. But does the stability (of a Clinton lead) change after FBI Director James Comey's bombshell Friday that his organization learned of the existence of new emails that appear ""pertinent"" to its previous investigation into Clinton's email practices?"

"Cassidy Hutchinson, a key aide in Donald Trump’s White House, told the House committee investigating the violent Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on Tuesday that Trump was informed that people rallying on the mall that morning had weapons but he told officials to “let my people in” and march to the Capitol.
Hutchinson quoted Trump as directing his staff, in profane terms, to take away the magnetometers that he thought would slow down supporters who’d gathered in Washington. In videotaped testimony played before the committee, she recalled the former president saying..."
"On both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday, the consequences of President Trump’s decision to ban most travel from Europe began to be felt economically, politically and socially.
European Union leaders issued a scathing statement condemning the move even as many nations on the Continent moved to tighten their own restrictions on the movement of people both within their borders and from outside.
“The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,” it said. “The European Union disapproves of the..."

The justices announced their decision to hear the case, known as United States v. Texas, on Tuesday, after their private conference meeting Friday morning. For weeks, the federal government and Texas had fought a procedural battle over whether the justices should take up the case before the end of June, the close of the court's current"
"A far-right Republican who backs Donald Trump’s election fraud lie and has vowed to decertify results in 2024 looked set on Wednesday to be the GOP candidate for US Senate in New Hampshire.
Don Bolduc, a retired special forces general who has said he suffered from PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, was on track to edge out Chuck Morse, the state senate president, to face the incumbent Democrat, Maggie Hassan, in November.
The primary was the last in a series that have seen Republicans select candidates aligned with Trump, causing some to..."
"One could almost hear the sighs of relief, from Paris to Brussels, and all the way to Washington, as French leader Emmanuel Macron clinched another five-year term in the Elysée Palace. Though polls narrowed during some points leading up to Sunday’s runoff, Macron eventually beat out far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen in the presidential elections—a contest that risked shattering the Western alliance against Russia, and jeopardizing the very survival of the European Union.

""There's a shared responsibility, not just across government agencies but across the private sector and even the average..."
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) confronted her critics — both Republicans and Democrats — on Thursday after Democratic losses in Tuesday’s House special elections brought new scrutiny to her leadership and fresh calls for her to step aside lest she drag down her party’s candidates in the 2018 midterms.
"The U.S. will begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines with the world once it clears federal safety reviews, the White House said Monday, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months.

"The US will share up to 60m doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine with other countries, the White House has announced, amid intensifying pressure for it to lead the global fight against the pandemic.
The pledge came as Joe Biden spoke with Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, which is reportedly running out of Covid-19 vaccines just as a deadly second wave continues to devastate the country.

"The second sign-up season under President Barack Obama's health overhaul opened Saturday, with hopes that this time consumers will have a positive experience.
But the fear is that entrenched political opposition and renewed legal challenges may yet collapse the program that's bringing health care to millions of previously uninsured Americans. The administration can't afford another technology meltdown.
With 7 million paying customers in new insurance markets, the Affordable Care Act has shown it is helping to reduce the number of uninsured. Insurers, not known for altruism, have stuck with the..."
"WASHINGTON -- Democrats from the White House and beyond panned the new ""Plan B"" proposal of House Speaker John Boehner avoid at least the tax portion of the fiscal cliff, but anti-tax GOP House members sounded cautiously optimistic about the idea of passing a measure that allows tax hikes only on income over $1 million.
Boehner said on Tuesday that he is working up the proposal in the event that he and President Barack Obama are unable to come to a broader agreement by the looming Dec. 31 deadline, after..."
"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday proposed letting tax rates go up on income above $1 million as a short-term step to avoid some of the fiscal cliff while continuing to negotiate a broader deal with President Barack Obama.
The White House and Democratic leaders immediately rejected Boehner's move, saying the focus of the incremental negotiations should be a comprehensive deficit-reduction agreement.
The back-and-forth in the halls of Congress came two weeks from the end of the year, when au"
"The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a woman’s right to choose is a reminder that state and local penal codes are littered with lots of regulations rendered moot by court rulings. Like a filing cabinet that’s never cleaned out, these dead laws just sit there collecting dust, presumably never to be heard of again.
What the Supreme Court ruling highlights is that laws on the books are never entirely dead. Michigan, West Virginia, and Wisconsin all have old laws on the books banning abortion pre-dating the original Roe v. Wade decision in 1972. The states never..."

The WMO, a United Nations agency, reported the average global air temperature in 2014 was 1.03 degrees above the long-term average of 57.2 degrees. That puts 2014 slightly ahead of both 2010 and 2005, the previous warmest two years.

President Trump said Monday that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug whose effectiveness against the coronavirus is unproven, for about a week and a half as a preventive measure, saying he had no symptoms of Covid-19.
“All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK,” he said, explaining that he takes a daily pill.

"Apple’s splashy new iPhone and AppleWatch rollout was all about big screens and wearable technology, but the new products face serious questions regarding the privacy and security of people’s personal health records.
The company on Tuesday sought to redefine the market for “wearables” — devices that people use to track their fitness and health, and whose technology could ultimately become an integral and profitable part of the U.S. health care system. But exactly what happens to that data is open to question."
"After a two-week long strike, the Minneapolis teachers union and Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) finally came to an agreement. However, it came with a caveat. In regards to layoffs, the new contract suggests white teachers would be considered before teachers of color, per ABC 4 News. You can imagine the outrage that announcement sparked.
In an effort to revise how the district hires and retains teachers of color, the new contract states that teachers will be subject to layoffs or job changes in “order of seniority,” unless the teacher is part of an “underrepresented group.” The Minnesota Reformer reported..."

"First the Obama administration and the intelligence community said there was no program gathering Americans' data. Then they said the government was only gathering focused bits of data and only on foreign targets.
Then they admitted intelligence operatives were gathering large amounts of data but not accessing it unless a court first gave the OK.
Now it appears there are thousands of times each year when the data of Americans not suspected of having anything to do with terrorism are gathered."

"Washington (CNN) - Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told lawmakers Tuesday that the US will be increasing coronavirus testing, saying, ""we're going to be doing more testing, not less,"" in response to President Donald Trump's recent claim that he asked to slow down testing during the pandemic.
Fauci's remarks came during a hearing convened by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic, where he and other government officials are testifying as witnesses.
LIVE UPDATES: Fauci, Redfield testify..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government’s top infectious disease expert said Tuesday he is cautiously optimistic that there will be a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year or early 2021, but warned that the next few weeks will be critical to tamping down coronavirus hot spots around the country.
Dr. Anthony Fauci and other top health officials also said they have not been asked to slow down testing for coronavirus, an issue that became controversial after President Donald Trump said last weekend that he had asked them to do..."
"President Trump on Wednesday decried reported health agency efforts to issue stricter guidelines for evaluating a vaccine against COVID-19, accusing the Food and Drug Administration of playing politics.
Trump was apparently reacting to a Tuesday report in the New York Times that said the agency will soon move to tighten requirements for emergency authorization of any coronavirus vaccine to better ensure its safety and effectiveness.
""That has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it. That sounds like a political move,"" Trump said during..."
"The Food and Drug Administration plans to soon issue stricter guidelines for the emergency authorization of any new coronavirus vaccine, adding a new layer of caution to the vetting process even as President Trump continues to contradict his own scientific experts and promise that a vaccine will be available as early as next month.
The guidelines, which may be formally released as early as this week if approved by the White House, would lay out more specific criteria for clinical trial data and recommend that the data be vetted by..."
"The number of Americans losing jobs to the coronavirus pandemic continued last week to climb steeply, the Labor Department reported Thursday, with 3.2 million new unemployment claims filed.
The latest figure, which covers the week ending May 2, puts job losses over the past seven weeks at nearly 33.5 million, prompting many economists to suggest that unemployment now stands higher than in most Americans' lifetimes.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release its more precise estimate of the April unemployment rate as part of its monthly jobs report...."
"Ms. Conway said she was stepping away from her role as the president’s counselor to spend more time with her four teenage children.
Kellyanne Conway, President Trump’s counselor and one of his longest-serving and most visible aides, said on Sunday night that she planned to leave the White House next week.
In a statement posted on Twitter, Ms. Conway said she was stepping away from a demanding job to spend more time with her four teenage children. “This is completely my choice and my voice,” she said. “In time, I..."
"Kellyanne Conway, one of President Donald Trump’s most influential and longest serving advisers, announced Sunday that she would be leaving the White House at the end of the month.
Conway, Trump’s campaign manager during the stretch run of the 2016 race, was the first woman to successfully steer a White House bid, then became a senior counselor to the president. She informed Trump of her decision in the Oval Office.
Conway cited a need to spend time with her four children in a resignation letter she posted Sunday night. Her..."
"President Biden had promised to halve U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, but an essential tool the administration planned to use to achieve that goal now appears out of reach.
The New York Times reported Friday that Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, has indicated to the White House that he opposes the key climate measure in Biden's multitrillion-dollar climate and social programs package.
The president needs the support of all 50 Democratic senators in order to pass the measure through a process known as reconciliation.
The program in..."
"The Clean Energy Performance Program, the linchpin of President Biden’s proposed climate change legislation, is likely to be dropped from the Democrats’ spending bill because of opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., multiple sources have told NBC News.
The sources say that the program will most likely be removed from the massive spending package known as the “reconciliation bill” that Democrats plan without Republican support, but that negotiations are ongoing and that no final decision has been made.
The $150 billion program, known as the CEPP, is the most sweeping..."
"A NEW PIECE of evidence has emerged buttressing the credibility of Tara Reade’s claim that she told her mother about allegations of sexual harassment and assault related to her former boss, then-Sen. Joe Biden. Biden, through a spokesperson, has denied the allegations. Reade has claimed to various media outlets, including The Intercept, that she told her mother, a close friend, and her brother about both the harassment and, to varying degrees of detail, the assault at the time. Her brother, Collin Moulton, and her friend, who has asked to remain..."
"(CNN)Newly surfaced video from 1993 appears to feature the mother of Tara Reade, a woman who accused presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden of sexual assault, calling into a cable TV show to seek advice around the time of the alleged assault.
In a ""Larry King Live"" segment that aired on August 11, 1993, on CNN, an unnamed woman calls in to the show with her location identified on the screen as San Luis Obispo, California. The show was about the cutthroat nature of Washington, DC, politics and media."
"Saturday's presidential nominating contests have a sense of ""day after the big party"" leftovers. There are some broken pretzels, that strange Jello mold your cousin brought that nobody ate and, somehow, magically, a half rack of ribs that never got out of the fridge.
The contests are also oddly scattered around. While Super Tuesday had a concentrated swath of contests for both parties across the South that were closely watched, Spotty Saturday has"
"The hunt for delegates picks back up on “Super Saturday” as voters head to primaries and caucuses across five states and Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton try to extend their leads in the Republican and Democratic presidential races.

"Americans are losing faith in their schoolteachers.
New polling suggests that fierce debates over what educators should be allowed to do and say in classrooms, an ascendant parents’ rights movement seeking control of what children learn at school, recent criticism of teachers from conservative lawmakers and news outlets and the lingering aftershocks from the pandemic have all sapped public confidence in the teaching profession.
In January, a Gallup poll found that Americans’ belief in grade-school teachers’ honesty had dropped to an all-time low, with 64 percent of adults reporting they believe..."
"A jury on Friday found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on charges related to his shooting dead two people at an anti-racism protest and injuring a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin last year, after a tumultuous trial that gripped America.
Rittenhouse killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, when he shot them with an assault rifle as he roamed the streets of Kenosha with other self-described militia during protests in August 2020, after a white police officer shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.
The trial was seen as..."
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin announced Friday that he will vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, clearing the way to an all-but-certain confirmation.
The West Virginia Democrat has become a pivotal vote in the evenly divided Senate, as he often sides with Republicans, and his opposition could have blocked Jackson from becoming the first Black woman to sit on the bench."
"The U.S.-Saudi relationship has lately endured some of the worst tensions in its history. But President Joe Biden’s first visit to the Middle East next month, with stops in Israel and Saudi Arabia, offers a surprising opportunity — if both sides will take it.
A wide range of issues have stoked disagreement and mistrust between the longtime partners: Iran nuclear talks, the war in Yemen, the Saudi posture on U.S. rivals Russia and China, human rights (including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi), social reform in the Kingdom, oil production and..."
"Top Republicans and witnesses ripped the Obama administration's response to last year's deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, calling key executive branch officials unresponsive in the critical hours after the assault and uncooperative in the investigations that followed.
Our goal ""is to get answers because their families (of the victims) deserve answers,"" said California Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which heard from State Department ""whistleblowers"" at a hearing on Wednesday."
"For anyone looking for evidence that boasts about “America First” — and the need for America to go-it-alone — are over, President Biden’s speech to the Munich Security Conference was meant as an opening argument.
“America is back, the trans-Atlantic alliance is back,” Mr. Biden declared. Trying to expunge the last four years without ever once naming his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden said “we are not looking backward.”
And then he went on to offer a 15-minute ode to the power of alliances.
He talked about an America..."
"The global race to net-zero emissions has begun. But the world has much further to run.
The European Union, Japan, the UK and many other major world economies have set ambitious goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. China, the world's biggest emitter, is aiming to be carbon neutral before 2060. And US President Joe Biden announced the nation's return to the Paris Agreement and is putting the fight against climate change at the heart of his administration's goals.
These announcements must now be backed up by equally ambitious actions..."
"Jeb Bush says he's not reducing his presidential campaign, he is simply refocusing it with an eye toward the early caucus and primary states.
""We've made an adjustment in our campaign,"" Bush said Saturday before conducting a town hall in the pivotal state of South Carolina. ""That's what leaders do.""
Stumping the Palmetto State a day after his campaign announced staff reductions and pay cuts, Bush dismissed critics who said the changes reflect a struggling campaign that is losing ground to any number of rivals.
""Blah, blah, blah,"" Bush said...."
"A beleaguered Jeb Bush slashed his campaign spending. Donald J. Trump lost his lead in Iowa. And a surging Ben Carson galvanized his support among social conservatives.
With Hillary Rodham Clinton emerging as the unrivaled leader in the Democratic contest, the unruly Republican presidential field suddenly seemed to lack a center of political gravity on Friday, leaving party strategists and voters to fear a long nomination fight that could end with a damaged standard-bearer facing a more unified left."
"The Senate tabled an effort by Sen. Rand Paul Tuesday to force a vote on the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, but the vote offered an indicator for how Republican senators -- who overwhelmingly voted for Paul's measure -- feel about the trial.
Paul's motion was killed on a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all Democrats, meaning 45 Republicans voted for Paul's effort. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania..."
"In the chaotic hours after an 18-year-old gunman went on a rampage at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 young children and two teachers, a narrative emerged about a heroic Border Patrol agent who stopped the massacre before it got any worse.
The agent, initial reports said, was off-duty and hurried to the scene of the shooting, then charged in without waiting for backup and single-handedly took out the gunman, who’d barricaded himself inside a classroom. The purported act of selflessness and courage was a balm for an otherwise unthinkable tragedy—at..."
"A late-stage study of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate has been paused while the company investigates whether a study participant’s “unexplained illness” is related to the shot.
The company said in a statement Monday evening that illnesses, accidents and other so-called adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” but that its physicians and a safety monitoring panel would try to determine what might have caused the illness.
The pause is at least the second such hold to occur among several vaccines that have..."
"The coronavirus pandemic has upended lives and disrupted the global economy. The sooner we can get a vaccine, the sooner we have a chance at returning to normal. That doesn’t mean we should needlessly rush it.
Vaccine development and approval normally takes several years, but it has been squeezed into a period of less than year. In Donald Trump’s America, that’s not soon enough -- but there is a way to speed things up even further. The Food and Drug Administration, as the gatekeeper for any new medicine coming to..."
"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul introduced a bill on Thursday to ban no-knock warrants -- the type of warrant that ultimately led to the wrongful shooting death of Breonna Taylor, one of multiple black people who died as a result of excessive police force, prompting protests nationwide.
The Justice for Breonna Taylor Act bans federal law enforcement officers from carrying out a warrant ""until after the officer provides notice of his or her authority and purpose"" and blocks state and local law enforcement agencies that receive Justice Department funding from carrying..."
"White House officials don’t expect President Donald Trump to pardon himself, family members or close aides, but clemency is in the works for a famous rapper and others, according to people familiar with the matter.
Trump is expected to announce a list of pardons on Tuesday -- his final full day in office -- and had discussed with aides the possibility of blanket pardoning himself, in anticipation he might later be charged with federal crimes. Trump has previously claimed such power, though it’s a matter of legal dispute and has..."
"In the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd nearly one month ago, protests continue to unfold as people across the country are examining the role that systemic racism plays in society. And as the Black Lives Matter movement gains support among the public, Fox News and others in right-wing media are focused on demonizing it, fearmongering about the movement’s intentions and using racist dog whistles to discredit it.
Black Lives Matter was initially founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of the man who killed Travyon Martin,..."
"The president of Mexico says he wants to avoid a confrontation with the United States, but had harsh words about President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Mexican goods to pressure the nation to stem the flow of Central American migrants.
""America First is a fallacy,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, often referred to as AMLO, said in a public letter released late Thursday.
López Obrador also announced he was sending his foreign minister to Washington, D.C., on Friday to negotiate with U.S. officials ahead of a June 10..."
"President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday that he would defend the interests of Mexicans but wanted to avoid a clash with Washington, after the Trump administration announced it would slap punitive tariffs on its southern neighbor unless it did more to stop irregular migration.
“There is no need for confrontation,” the leftist president said at his daily morning news conference.
Mexico is heavily dependent on trade and this year has surged to become the No. 1 trading partner of the United States, eclipsing Canada and China. The Mexican peso..."
"In a major legal blow to President Trump’s push to expand offshore oil and gas development, a federal judge ruled that an executive order by Mr. Trump that lifted an Obama-era ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic coast was unlawful.
The decision, by Judge Sharon L. Gleason of the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, concluded late Friday that President Barack Obama’s 2015 and 2016 withdrawal from drilling of about 120 million acres of Arctic Ocean..."
"Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had a testy exchange with a prominent black radio personality on Friday over Biden’s support among black voters and his choosing of a running mate.
Charlamagne Tha God pressed Biden on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be vice president and told him black voters “saved your political life in the primaries” and “have things they want from you.”
“I’m not acknowledging anybody who is being considered,” Biden said. “But I guarantee you there are multiple..."
"Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee and is beating Trump in the latest national polls.
This morning, the 77-year-old former vice president appeared on The Breakfast Club and made surprising comments about Black voters.
During a round of press interviews, Biden did a virtual one-on-one with Charlamagne of The Breakfast Club. As Biden’s rep was trying to close the interview, Charlamagne said, “You can't do that to Black media!”
Biden replied with, “I do that to white media and Black media because my wife has to go on..."
"Massively popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has repeatedly sown doubt about COVID-19 vaccines, admitted this week that he almost got vaccinated a few months ago but scheduling conflicts caused him to miss his appointment.
During a marathon three-hour interview with CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan wanted to make it clear to both Gupta and his audience that he is not actually anti-vaccine. And his proof was that he had planned to get the shot but never actually did."
"Republican leaders are trying to sink legislation establishing an independent commission on the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that would probably scrutinize former president Donald Trump’s role in the riot and his conversations with Republican lawmakers that day.
The bill passed the House on a 252-to-175 vote Wednesday with 35 Republicans supporting the measure, but its chances of clearing the Senate dimmed after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) came out against the bill earlier in the day.
He said he opposes the legislation because it is a..."
"Warning that her city’s services have been overwhelmed, the mayor of Washington, D.C., has asked the Biden administration for the National Guard’s help in assisting migrants being bused to the nation’s capital by Texas and Arizona.
Mayor Muriel Bowser, in two letters sent last week to the Department of Defense and the White House, said that she empathizes with the recently arrived people but that the city needs help processing and housing the migrants until they reach their final destinations.
“The pace of the arriving buses and the volume of..."
"Steve Bannon — currently facing contempt of Congress charges after defying a subpoena to appear before the Jan. 6 committee — has signaled that he is willing to testify in front of the committee.
CNN reported Sunday that Bannon’s lawyer Bob Costello sent a letter to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealing the former Trump strategist’s plans.
Costello wrote in the letter. “Mr. Bannon is willing to, and indeed prefers, to testify at your public hearing.”"
"The Consumer Price index, which tallies the cost of a basket of goods month to month, jumped 1 percent in May compared to the 0.3 percent increase in April — a sign inflation remains red hot.
Compared to one year ago, the index in May hit 8.6 percent, rising from the 8.3 percent year-on-year increase seen a month prior. That's the highest reading since 1981.
And the ""core"" index that excludes the costs of food and energy clocked in at 0.6 percent last month, compared to 0.6 percent in April.

"The costs of gas, food and other necessities jumped in May, raising inflation to a new four-decade high and giving American households no respite from rising costs.
Consumer prices surged 8.6% last month from 12 months earlier, faster than April’s year-over-year surge of 8.3%, the Labor Department said Friday.
On a month-to-month basis, prices jumped 1% from April to May, a steep rise from the 0.3% increase from March to April. Much higher gas prices were to blame for most of that increase.
America’s rampant inflation is imposing severe pressures..."
"WASHINGTON — For more than a week, Samiullah “Sammy” Naderi, a U.S. legal permanent resident, waited days and nights with his wife and son outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, hoping to be let in so that they could leave on one of the dozens of daily flights headed to America.
“It’s 50 feet away,” Mr. Naderi, 23, said Sunday night in a short telephone interview, speaking in halting English, as gunfire crackled in the background. “Maybe the Taliban will let me inside — maybe.”
But on Monday, after being..."
"Seated at the head of his Situation Room conference table, President Donald Trump was adamant: American troops must come home from Syria. He had just announced as much to a crowd in Ohio. The assembled military and national security advisers told him the move was rash and unwise. So he gave them six months."
"Media literacy is clearly not Joe Rogan’s strong suit. The podcast host recently took to Instagram to share a fake CNN report stating that actor Steven Seagal has joined Russian special forces stationed near Kyiv, Ukraine, noting the absurdity of “this fucked up movie we’re living through.” He later took it down, for obvious reasons.
“I deleted my earlier post about Steven Seagal being in Ukraine because it was parody, which isn’t surprising, but honestly it wouldn’t be surprising if it was true either,” he wrote in a follow-up post. “He was..."
"Supreme Court justices on Monday readily put themselves in the shoes of a football coach who wanted to pray at midfield after a game, over those of students who might feel pressure to join him, in an expansive decision focused on the “suppression” of religious voices.
The 6-3 ruling against a Washington state school district that suspended coach Joseph Kennedy reinforces a modern court pattern favoring religious conservatives and a greater mingling of church and state.
Overall, the decision reflected the conservative majority’s view that the voices of religious believers are..."
"A wave of ""smash-and-grab"" crimes is plaguing upscale stores in major US cities, with mobs of thieves making off with expensive goods in brazen, nighttime raids.
At least 18 people broke into a Nordstrom department store in Los Angeles Monday night and stole thousands of dollars in merchandise, the city's police chief said.
The thefts followed a rash of similar incidents over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. A group of thieves swarmed the Southland Mall in Hayward on Sunday evening, wielding hammers to smash cases at a jewelry store before grabbing..."
"Donald Trump’s new memorandum to exclude undocumented immigrants from the next round of congressional apportionment is morally repulsive, illegal, and impossible. It is repulsive because it borrows the logic of the notorious Three-Fifths Clause to declare that undocumented immigrants are not full “persons” under the Constitution. It is illegal because it seeks to exclude these immigrants from a state’s population when counting how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives, which violates the Constitution. And it is impossible because there is no way that the government can..."
"Hillary Rodham Clinton will soon add to the solitary Twitter message she has sent dealing with the controversy over her private email use as secretary of state.
Sources close to Mrs. Clinton say she is preparing to address the controversy in the coming days, and one option is a news conference. Politico and CNN reported on the plans earlier.

"The White House is finalizing expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials.
Members of the White House coronavirus task force and other officials received the guidelines late last week, according to senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the guidelines have not been officially released.
It represents the most detailed guidance to date on the administration’s plan to gradually reopen key sectors of..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Businesses should close break rooms. Restaurants should consider disposable menus and plates. Schools should have students eat lunch in their classrooms.
These are some of the recommendations offered in new federal plans designed to help restaurants, schools, churches and businesses safely reopen as states look to gradually lift their coronavirus restrictions.
The draft guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been sent to Washington but still could be revised before the Trump administration unveils it to the public. The recommendations were obtained from a..."
"Apple will continue to manufacture its Mac Pro computer in Austin, Texas, the company announced today, just days after the Trump administration granted the company tariff exemptions for Mac Pro components made in China.
The U.S. Trade Representative last week granted 10 of the 15 exemptions that Apple requested, Bloomberg reported. Apple CEO Tim Cook today credited the Trump administration for the company’s decision to keep assembling the Mac Pro in Texas.
“We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,” Cook said in a statement.

"The so-called ""Justice for J6"" rally, a right-wing protest Saturday to support the insurrectionists facing criminal charges in the January 6 attack, was smaller than expected. It also lacked the mayhem and violence the Department of Homeland Security feared might break out.
But that doesn't mean it wasn't dangerous.
The rally in Washington, DC, was part of a dangerous attempt to rewrite the history of that dark day in America.
For months, Trump spread baseless lies about widespread election fraud, claimed the election had been ""stolen,"" and urged his followers to take action...."
"WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney insisted on Friday that he has paid taxes every year and repeated that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) needs ""to put up or shut up"" with his accusations that he hasn't.

"A memo from Peter Navarro is the most direct warning known to have circulated at a key moment among top administration officials.
A top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.
The warning, written in a memo by Peter Navarro, President Trump’s trade adviser, is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first..."
"While President Donald Trump played down concerns about the coronavirus in January and February, a top White House adviser warned that a coronavirus pandemic could cost the country trillions of dollars and endanger millions of Americans, according to two new reports.
Peter Navarro, the top trade and manufacturing aide to the president, laid out the warning in two memos - one on Jan. 29 and another on Feb. 23, according to reports from the New York Times and Axios. Trump has repeatedly said that no one could have predicted the..."
"Never let it be said that the Trump administration can't walk and chew gum at the same time. Even as the president's minions work overtime to botch every single aspect of the federal response to the COVID-19 crisis and prepare to cover up the number of cases and the number of deaths in order to make his ""numbers"" look good, they still manage to find the time to complete the purge of Trump critics within the government and destroy all mechanisms for accountability.
Trump's forces have pretty much rendered the..."
"WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's decision Friday to fire his department's inspector general marks the fourth time within the last three months that an internal agency watchdog has been targeted for removal by the Trump administration.
IGs are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Working within the agency they monitor, the inspector generals and their staffs are charged with reporting on government malfeasance and corruption.
Here's a look at the inspector generals who have been ousted recently:
State Department IG Steve Linick was appointed in..."
"Maybe you’ve never heard of Livingston County, Michigan. It’s not Oakland County, the vote-rich behemoth located next door; nor is it Macomb County, the much-mythologized home of the culturally conservative “Reagan Democrats” who began defecting to the Republican Party decades ago. It’s a lot less populated, and a little too far from Detroit, to attract much notice from journalists and pundits. And yet, as the returns rolled in Tuesday night from Michigan’s primary, it was Livingston that told the most compelling story. Not for what it said about Bernie Sanders..."
"Anger and frustration mounted in Congress as a nationwide eviction moratorium expired at midnight Saturday — one Democratic lawmaker even camping outside the Capitol in protest as millions of Americans faced being forced from their homes.
Lawmakers said they were blindsided by President Joe Biden’s inaction as the deadline neared, some furious that he called on Congress to provide a last-minute solution to protect renters. The rare division between the president and his party carried potential lasting political ramifications.
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the chair of the Financial Services Committee, said Saturday..."
"Marco Rubio doesn’t lead in any of the polls, but that didn’t stop his presidential rivals from going after the Florida senator during Saturday night's debate as the candidates battled to be the GOP establishment’s less crazy alternative to Donald Trump.

"Marco Rubio was stuck on repeat Saturday night, and it threatens his momentum in the New Hampshire primary.
The POLITICO Caucus – a panel of operatives, strategists and activists in the early-nominating states – overwhelmingly judged Rubio the loser of the final debate before the first-in-the-nation primary."
"In a night marked by constant interruptions and blatant fact-fudging, it was a moment that sparked a separate online melee.
Moderator Chris Wallace gave President Donald Trump an uninterrupted opportunity to condemn the nation's biggest domestic terrorist groups: white supremacists. Instead, Trump said they should “stand back and stand by.” What's more, he said, the violence in cities like Kenosha and Portland is a “left-wing problem, not a right-wing problem.”"
"A day after federal officials revealed that a woman who took part in the mass shooting in San Bernardino had pledged support for the Islamic State, that extremist group reported over its official online radio service that the man-and-wife team who killed 14 were supporters of the organization.
""Two followers of Islamic State attacked several days ago a center in San Bernardino in California,"" the group reported on its Al-Bayan daily broadcast, according to Reuters. But the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, stopped short of claiming responsibility..."
"Friday morning, multiple news outlets reported some disturbing news: One of the San Bernardino shooters, 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik, apparently pledged allegiance to ISIS in a Facebook post before the shooting.
These reports cite unnamed federal law enforcement officials, so it's important to exercise caution about their veracity at this point. And even if they do turn out to be true, it's important to be cautious about what they mean: The fact that a shooter pledged allegiance to I"

"The Republican nomination is in his grasp. Now the question becomes: Can Donald Trump win the White House?
With a decisive victory in the Indiana primary Tuesday, the billionaire businessman who was initially ridiculed as a fringe candidate was declared the party's presumptive nominee by Republican National Chairman Committee Reince Priebus. Trump has defeated 16 primary rivals, including some of the GOP's top governors and senators, and defied the conventional wisdom that he wouldn't run and couldn't win.
His primary rivals and other senior Republicans have argued that Trump's lack..."
"A general election matchup between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton became all but certain on Tuesday after Mr. Trump’s decisive victory in Indiana. He would begin that matchup at a significant disadvantage.
Yes, it’s still a long way until Election Day. And Mr. Trump has already upended the conventional wisdom many times. But this is when early horse-race polls start to give a rough sense of the November election, and Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton by around 10 percentage points in early general election surveys, both nationally and in..."
"The Trump administration Wednesday issued a sweeping ban on imports of cotton or tomato products from China’s Xinjiang region, saying it had reviewed evidence of forced labor in the region.
The move is the administration’s latest effort to punish China over what Western officials and human rights groups call the country’s campaign of repression against the Muslim Uighur population of Xinjiang, which has included the population’s mass detention in camps.
The ban, which covers everything from cotton apparel to canned tomatoes, will affect a wide array of U.S. importers. Xinjiang..."
"Despite supporters' hopes that this time it's different, President Barack Obama's new call for restricting some semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines will face deeply entrenched resistance in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and could be a long shot even in the Democratic-led Senate.
Any gun legislation sent to the House ""is going to have to pass with most Democrats and a few Republicans,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""This would be an even more high-profile bill."""
"President Donald Trump issued a thinly veiled threat Friday to fired FBI Director James Comey, an extraordinary development in the ongoing feud between the President and the agencies investigating alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.
""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press,"" the President tweeted."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, beginning to venture out on the campaign trail, went to Pittsburgh on Monday to deliver a searing rebuke to President Trump. “This president long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country. He can’t stop the violence — because for years he has fomented it,” Biden declared. “You know, he may believe mouthing the words ‘law and order’ makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he..."
"Bill Clinton spent 13 minutes yesterday forcefully responding to Black Lives Matter activists who were heckling him. Speaking in an overwhelmingly African American neighborhood of Philadelphia, the city that will host this summer’s Democratic National Convention, the former president offered a spirited defense of his record on civil rights, his signature crime bill and his wife."
"As the House of Representatives voted Wednesday to impeach Donald Trump for a second time, some Republicans argued that such a move — a constitutional obligation, really — was unnecessarily divisive at a time when the nation should be healing and proposing unity.
The irony is that this plea is being made by many of the same legislators who just last week were supportive of Trump’s scheme to fraudulently overturn the results of a free and fair election, thereby disenfranchising millions of voters who formed the majority of the electorate...."
"The nation's top infectious diseases expert said Sunday he did not expect the U.S. will need to reenter lockdown, as the Delta strain of the coronavirus drives surges in new cases across the country.
""I don't think we're going to see lockdowns,"" Anthony Fauci said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think we have enough of the percentage of people in the country, not enough to crush the outbreak, but I believe enough to not allow us to get into the situation we were in last winter,"" he added.

"Weeks ago, when Rudy Giuluani first threw the contents of Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop online, he promised a trove of even more damning information 10 days before the election.
Yet with less than a week to go, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is still moving down the conservative media food chain, looking for takers."
"Climate change is changing Earth in ways that are ""unprecedented"" in thousands — and in some cases, hundreds of thousands — of years, according to a blistering report released by the United Nations on Monday.
The sobering assessment also found that some changes that are already playing out, such as warming oceans and rising sea levels, are ""irreversible for centuries to millennia.""
The report is the most comprehensive assessment from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2013 and provides the strongest case yet for human-caused global warming, saying it's..."
"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has made no secret of the fact that he spanks his daughter when she misbehaves. He has also suggested the American people should deliver a “spanking” to Hillary Clinton.
Now, he is prescribing the same discipline for a protester who interrupted him during a rally in Indiana on Sunday.

"The C.D.C. has only published a fraction of the data it has collected since the onset of the pandemic two years ago, withholding significant data and information that could have supported local officials in targeting their pandemic mitigation efforts.
The agency is only now sharing wastewater data with the public, despite having access to state wastewater information since the beginning of the pandemic. Additionally, it has collected hospitalization data according to age, race, and vaccination status for over a year, but most of the information hasn’t been released. According..."
"For more than a year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has collected data on hospitalizations for Covid-19 in the United States and broken it down by age, race and vaccination status. But it has not made most of the information public.
When the C.D.C. published the first significant data on the effectiveness of boosters in adults younger than 65 two weeks ago, it left out the numbers for a huge portion of that population: 18- to 49-year-olds, the group least likely to benefit from extra shots, because the first two..."
"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday the U.S. is expected to reach the highest number of people apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in two decades.
“We are on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years. We are expelling most single adults and families. We are not expelling unaccompanied children,"" Mayorkas said in a statement addressing what he described as a “difficult” situation at the border.
“Our goal is a safe, legal and orderly immigration system that is based on..."
"A Breitbart video touting misinformation about the coronavirus has quickly spread across social-media platforms, where clips were retweeted by President Donald Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr.
The video, which got more than 14 million views on Facebook alone, according to CNN, which cited CrowdTangle data, has since been taken down from Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter — including removing tweets that the president shared.
""Tweets with the video are in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,"" a Twitter representative told Business Insider. ""We are taking action in line with..."
"Twitter has temporarily suspended the account belonging to Donald Trump Jr, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, after he posted content that violated the company’s policies on misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The account will be suspended for 12 hours, during which time Don Jr. will be barred from posting new messages, liking or retweeting other posts. He will still be allowed to use Twitter’s Direct Message service to contact his followers. A Twitter spokesperson said this was not a suspension but rather a ""temporary lockout until the..."
"The Kremlin signaled Monday it is ready to keep talking with the West about security grievances that led to the current Ukraine crisis, offering hope that Russia might not invade its beleaguered neighbor within days as the U.S. and European allies increasingly fear.
Questions remain about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions, however. And countries are evacuating diplomats and on alert for possible imminent war amid the worst East-West tensions since the Cold War.
On a last-ditch diplomatic trip, Germany’s chancellor said there are “no sensible reasons” for the buildup of more than 130,000 Russian..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin and his trusty foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, on Monday signaled that there would be no imminent military strike on Ukraine and that they were prepared to continue diplomatic dialogue with the West, led by the United States.
Coming after the U.S. warned that a major invasion could begin as soon as Wednesday, the geopolitical dance moves were so exquisitely choreographed that a meeting between Putin and Lavrov might have been better held on stage at the Bolshoi Theater, rather than around a huge rectangular conference table..."
"China has committed ""serious human rights violations"" against Uyghur Muslims in its northwestern region of Xinjiang, which may amount to ""crimes against humanity"" according to a long-awaited report released Wednesday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The detailed 45-page report, published just minutes before outgoing commissioner Michelle Bachelet's term in office came to an end at midnight Geneva time, had been repeatedly delayed, and its release vehemently opposed by China.
The report, which documented what it described as arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominately Muslim..."
"Since late fall, 60,000 students and teachers across Greenville County, South Carolina, have been filing into the classroom for school the old-fashioned way: in-person, five days a week.
They've done it, Greenville superintendent Burke Royster said, by enforcing mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing -- mostly by about 3 feet with plexiglass barriers when 6 feet isn't possible -- using high-quality ventilation and launching their own contact-tracing program.
Royster said he believes his schools have lower transmission than its surrounding community -- a finding that is supported by research...."
"The House Judiciary Committee will vote Wednesday to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress, after the Justice Department appeared to miss a Monday deadline to negotiate the delivery of Robert S. Mueller III’s full report, along with key evidence collected by the special counsel."
"Rep. Nancy Mace, a first-term Republican from South Carolina, introduced a bill Monday to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level, which she hopes will garner more GOP support for the legalization movement.
""This legislation, I believe, has something good for everyone, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican,"" Mace told reporters outside the Capitol, where she introduced her States Reform Act.
Even though it is legal in 18 states, with medical use permissible in 37 states, marijuana is illegal under federal law.
Mace's bill would strip cannabis of its classification as a Schedule I..."
"Congress on Thursday approved a measure to fund the government into early December, staving off a shutdown that was set to occur after midnight.
The votes in the House and Senate followed weeks of hand wringing between the two parties, after Democrats initially sought to move the measure along with another proposal to raise the country’s debt ceiling. Senate Republicans blocked that effort, leaving the country’s ability to borrow unresolved just 18 days before the next major fiscal deadline.
The funding stopgap sustains federal agencies’ existing spending until December 3,..."
"New York Attorney General Letitia James' office says it needs the testimony of former President Donald Trump and two of his adult children to determine their knowledge of what investigators say they have identified as numerous ""misleading statements and omissions"" in tax submissions and financial statements used to obtain loans.
In a court filing late Tuesday, investigators stated the office ""intends to make a final determination about who is responsible for those misstatements and omissions,"" adding that ""OAG requires the testimony and evidence sought herein to determine which Trump Organization employees and affiliates — and..."
"The fracturing of society in recent years under the strain of Donald Trump’s presidency and the racial reckoning spurred by George Floyd’s murder has had one positive consequence: A widespread awakening of interest in the American past.
Curiosity about the country’s history has been a pathway to something more bracing: Sharp arguments about the meaning of the past, and about the lessons people living today should draw from the lives of people who died long ago.
Long-forgotten lives, like the dozens of people killed in the Tulsa race massacre, are..."
"Meeting at their first in-person convention since 2018, Texas Republicans on Saturday acted on a raft of resolutions and proposed platform changes to move their party even further to the right. They approved measures declaring that President Joe Biden “was not legitimately elected” and rebuking Sen. John Cornyn for taking part in bipartisan gun talks. They also voted on a platform that declares homosexuality “an abnormal lifestyle choice” and calls for Texas schoolchildren “to learn about the humanity of the preborn child.”
The actions capped a convention that highlighted how adamantly opposed..."
"Despite Bernie Sanders’ best efforts, Hillary Clinton remains on pace to secure her party’s nomination this summer. Assuming the overwhelming Democratic frontrunner makes it to the general election, though, potential trouble may be waiting. A new Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday finds Clinton trailing in a pair of important swing states and locked in too-close-to-call races in a third with the GOP’s Big Three: Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush."
"Hillary Clinton is in trouble in three key swing states, according to new Quinnipiac University polls released Wednesday.
In Colorado, Iowa and Virginia, the former secretary of state trails in hypothetical general-election matchups with three leading Republican candidates: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker."
"The Biden administration is casting conservative opponents of its Covid-19 vaccine campaign as dangerous and extreme, adopting a more aggressive political posture in an attempt to maneuver through the public health conundrum.
The White House has decided to hit back harder on misinformation and scare tactics after Republican lawmakers and conservative activists pledged to fight the administration’s stated plans to go “door-to-door” to increase vaccination rates. The pushback will include directly calling out social media platforms and conservative news shows that promote such tactics."
"President Donald Trump and two of his top public health advisers have taken different stances on the issue of when — and how — the decision to ease social distancing will be made.
Trump has advocated for aggressive goals in recent days, and said Saturday on Fox News that he plans to base his decision on when to adjust federal social distancing guidelines and ask businesses to reopen “on a lot of facts and a lot of instincts.”
But two of his health advisers, director of the National Institute of..."
"In utter defiance of historical trends, people are dying younger and younger in America. But what’s especially troubling is how these people are dying, a new report released this week found.
Life expectancy for Americans overall has dropped the last three years data is available, starting in 2014. Today, an average American can expect to live 78.6 years, down from 78.9 years in 2014.
That reversed a longtime trend of rising life expectancy. Between 1959 and 2016, the average American lifespan shot up from 69.9 years to 78.9 years."
"The engine that powers the world’s most potent economy is dying at a worrisome pace, a “distinctly American phenomenon’’ with no easily discernible cause or simple solution.
Those are some of the conclusions from a comprehensive new study by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University showing that mortality rates for U.S. adults ages 25-64 continue to increase, driving down the general population’s life expectancy for at least three consecutive years."
"Philadelphia has been chosen as the host city of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, party officials announced Thursday.
The decision is a huge disappointment for New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio had made a major effort to land the convention for Brooklyn. The city had put together a rich financial package to lure the Democratic National Committee.

"Democrats will host the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, CNN reported Thursday.
Leading up to the decision, Philadelphia was one of three cities -- including New York and Columbus, Ohio -- vying for the opportunity to host.

"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week even while the economy and the job market appear to be rebounding from the coronavirus recession with sustained energy.
Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims increased by 2,000 from the previous week to 373,000. Weekly applications, which generally track the pace of layoffs, have fallen steadily this year from more than 900,000 at the start of the year. The four-week average of applications, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, is now 394,500 — the lowest such level..."
"Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" that President Barack Obama had been ""too cautious"" in his response to the threat posed by Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
Asked by NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell if Obama's statement that the U.S. did not yet have a strategy to deal with ISIS projected weakness, Feinstein replied, ""I think I've learned one thing about this president, and that is h"
"The chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says President Barack Obama might be taking too long to respond to the growing threat from Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria.
“I’ve learned one thing about this president, and that is he’s very cautious. Maybe, in this instance, too cautious,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
Feinstein said she agrees with an op-ed by Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina over the weekend in The New York..."
"In the spring of 2020, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Jennifer Sey took a hard-line, controversial position: Schools should stay open.
At the time, Sey was chief marketing officer at Levi Strauss & Co., with 21 years at the company. Later in the year, Sey got promoted to Levi's brand president — on a path to potentially become the next CEO. Instead, she has now resigned.
""Ultimately,"" Sey told NPR, ""just about a month ago, the CEO said to me, 'There's just not a path for you here.' You know, 'It's..."
"Jennifer Sey was a rising star at Levi Strauss. The former gymnast spent decades working her way up at the jeans company, eventually even being considered a possible candidate to become CEO. Then COVID-19 happened. In a blog post, she wrote that she decided to leave the apparel maker after it pressured her to stop speaking about her opposition to school closures because of the pandemic. 
Sey also said she turned down $1 million in severance because she feared it would come with a non-disclosure agreement that would prohibit her from talking..."
"Inside Ted Cruz’s second-floor campaign office here on a recent afternoon, there were telltale signs of an operation in overdrive: dozens of volunteers calling voters and re­fueling with Mountain Dew, coffee and snacks; staffers busily working on laptops; and an ambitious message on a whiteboard: “Our Goal Today = 20,000 Calls.”
But there were also indications of trouble. Volunteers said they were hearing misgivings from voters — many rooted in insults that front-runner Donald Trump had hurled at Cruz."
"Donald Trump is raising the stakes in Indiana.
Encouraged by a new poll giving him a double-digit lead in the state and eager to pivot to the general election, the Republican front-runner stressed the importance of Indiana's Tuesday GOP primary more than he or his top advisers have previously.
""Indiana is so important and we have to win it,"" Trump said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a theater here in Terre Haute, Indiana. ""If we win Indiana, it's over.""
While also echoing his top advisers'..."
"A federal watchdog concluded that President Trump broke the law when he froze assistance funds for Ukraine last year, according to a report unveiled on Thursday.
The White House has said that it believed Trump was acting within his legal authority.
Trump's decision to freeze military aid appropriated by Congress is at the heart of impeachment proceedings against the president that are shifting venues this week from the Democrat-controlled House to the majority-Republican Senate."
"The Trump administration violated the law by withholding military aid to Ukraine, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a decision released Thursday.
""In the summer of 2019, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) withheld from obligation funds appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) for security assistance to Ukraine,"" the non-partisan government watchdog's ruling said.
""Faithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law. OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is..."
"The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. began writing the “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” in the margins of newspapers, on scraps of paper, paper towels and slips of yellow legal paper smuggled into his cell, where he was kept in solitary confinement after being arrested April 12, 1963, on charges of violating Alabama’s law against mass public demonstrations."
"As the nation celebrates King's national holiday Monday, it's easy to freeze-frame him as the benevolent dreamer carved in stone on the Washington Mall. Yet the platitudes that frame many King holiday events often fail to mention the most radical aspects of his legacy, says Jeanne Theoharis, a political science professor at Brooklyn College and author of several books on the civil rights movement."
Russian President Vladimir Putin made an unusual and direct appeal to the American people Wednesday night to reject President Obamas calls for possible use of force against Syria using an op-ed in The New York Times to counter many of the arguments Obama made 24 hours earlier in a speech to the nation.
"Almost exactly one year after the first case of the coronavirus was detected in the United States, the country has now reached 25 million confirmed infections. As it has for months, the U.S. remains by far the most coronavirus-riddled country in the world.
Data from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center showed the U.S. passing the tragic marker as of Sunday morning. The true number of cases, however, is likely far higher: Many people become infected but never get tested, so they aren't reflected in the count.
The U.S. has..."
"It took just over a year for the US to go from one to 25 million coronavirus infections.
That's an average of about 67,934 new infections every day, or an average of one new infection every 1.2 seconds since January 21, 2020.
As infections kept soaring this weekend, so did the death toll. As of Sunday, more than 417,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The US death toll could reach 569,000 by May 1, according to the University of..."
"From the moment the HBO series “The Jinx” made its debut, it has been called “the new ‘Serial.’” Both the series and the podcast are about unsolved murders. Both let viewers into the process of uncovering what happened. Both tell stories so compelling, it’s easy to sometimes forget the characters are real."
"Millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst's life is so bizarre that HBO made a documentary series about it called ""The Jinx."" But over the weekend, two major turns of events could end Durst's freedom: his arrest in New Orleans for a 2000 killing, and the broadcast of his restroom mutterings that were picked up on his live microphone."
"Frantically, I shot out of bed. My stomach was in knots, as it often was during those first few months of motherhood. My imagination on overdrive, I braced for the worst. I bent over my newborn’s crib and placed my hand on her chest. With a sigh of relief, I watched it move up and down.
Earlier that day, my infant daughter had received yet another round of what felt like endless vaccinations. I was an anxious, postpartum mess. I bawled each time the doctor poked her squishy thigh.

"The website that's meant to allow Americans to shop and sign up for new medical plans under the Affordable Care Act isn't working as well as it should, President Obama says. But he promised that the problems will be fixed — and he said the Affordable Care Act is bringing many benefits that aren't tied to those problems.
""Nobody is madder than me that the website isn't working as it should — which means that it's going to get fixed,"" Obama told a crowd at an outdoor address at the..."
"President Barack Obama said Monday that there's ""no excuse"" for the technical problems that have plagued the rollout of the Obamacare health insurance website, and promised all Americans would have access to health coverage under his law.
""There's no sugar-coating it. The website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process,"" Obama said from the White House's Rose Garden. ""Nobody's more frustrated than I am."" The president said he is ""confident"" that the myriad problems with the website, HealthCare.gov, will soon be fixed. The site..."

One million Americans have now died from the coronavirus, according to an announcement made Thursday by President Joe Biden, marking a long-dreaded milestone for an incomprehensible tragedy.
""Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19. One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic. Jill and I pray for each of them,"" Biden said in a statement. ""As..."

Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group and a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, tweeted a quote he attributed to Trump on Sunday afternoon.
""President Trump in Tokyo: 'Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden,' "" Bremmer tweeted."
"Russian forces pounded areas around Kyiv and another Ukrainian city overnight, local officials said Wednesday, just hours after Moscow pledged to scale back military operations in those places. The shelling further tempered optimism about possible progress in talks aimed at ending the punishing war.
Russia did not spell out what exactly a reduction in activity would look like, and while the promise initially raised hopes that a path toward ending the bloody war of attrition was at hand, Ukraine’s president and others cautioned that the commitments could merely be bluster.
Moscow, meanwhile, reacted..."
"President Joe Biden and other American officials voiced extreme caution Tuesday at signals Russia is scaling back its military operations near Kyiv, suggesting they were waiting to see stronger signs of de-escalation before making an assessment of Moscow's intentions.
""We'll see. I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through what they're suggesting,"" Biden said at the White House, where officials were busy digesting intelligence and reports from the ground that Russian troops were moving their focus away from Ukraine's capital toward other areas of..."
"In September 2003, a secret transaction took place. The location was Monaco, a tax haven associated with the international rich. Specifically, an exclusive block just beneath its lavish casino. An apartment changed hands. A local notary signed the deal. Purchase price: €3.6m (£3.1m). For this, the buyer got a luxury fourth-floor flat, two parking spaces, a storeroom, and the use of a pool in the Monte Carlo Star complex.
From the balcony the new owner could gaze down on Monaco’s sparkling marina, stuffed during the summer with floating superyachts. Security ensured..."
"The United States will have enough coronavirus vaccine doses for every adult in the country by the end of May, President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday, as production of a third vaccine is set to ramp up.
During a news conference at the White House, Biden said he had invoked a wartime production law to require pharmaceutical company Merck & Co to help produce a newly approved vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson.
The US already had contracts with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to supply 300 million COVID-19 vaccine doses –..."
"President Biden will meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Geneva on June 16, the White House said Tuesday, the first face-to-face session between the two leaders at a time of extraordinary tension over Ukraine, cyberattacks and a raft of new nuclear weapons Mr. Putin is deploying.
The meeting is expected to focus heavily on preventing nuclear escalation. Geneva was also the site of the 1985 summit between Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and Ronald Reagan, also focused on the nuclear arms race."
"Rosalia Manuel Luna began working at McDonald’s when she was 17 years old. 
Twenty-three years later, on July 8 this year, she was fired from her job. Luna alleges she was let go was in retaliation for speaking up in defense of a co-worker who was allegedly being sexually harassed as well as for her own dispute with McDonald’s over quarantine wages, which got her involved in the Fight for $15 and a Union, the SEIU-aligned movement of food and retail workers that’s been instrumental in improving local and state minimum..."

"Former President Barack Obama delivered a virtual commencement address on Saturday, urging the tens of thousands of graduates from historically black colleges and universities to ""seize the initiative"" amid what he described as a lack of leadership from leaders in the United States to the coronavirus pandemic.
""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said in remarks that were streamed online. ""A lot of them aren't even pretending to..."
"Barack Obama attacked the Trump administration’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic during a speech on Saturday.
The comments are a rare rebuke of a sitting president from one of his predecessors, and come in the midst of a pandemic that has had devastating and disproportionate effects on communities of color in the United States."
"Launching a fresh attack on President Obama's immigration policies, the House voted 236 to 191 Wednesday to block immigration actions he took last year, passing the bill after adding a series of amendments gutting most of his immigration policy.
But the votes exposed the new political contours of the expanded Republican majority. Ten Republicans, mostly from suburban swing districts, voted against the final bill after 26 had voted against a proposal to end Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects hundreds of thousands of ""dreamers."" The children have..."
"The Department of Justice sued the state of Idaho on Tuesday over its six-week abortion ban ― the first litigation filed by the Biden administration to protect reproductive rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday morning in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, states that Idaho’s six-week abortion ban is in direct violation of federal law because the restriction does not comply with the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The EMTALA statute requires that all patients receive appropriate medical care and stabilizing treatment in an emergency..."
"Joe Biden has announced a goal of ensuring 70% of American adults receive at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine by Independence Day on 4 July.
The US president urged people in their 20s and 30s in particular to get inoculated and said his administration was “ready to move immediately” if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 to 15.
“Our goal by July 4th is to have 70% of adult Americans with at least one shot and 160 million Americans fully..."
"WASHINGTON – As many as 3.1 million recipients could lose their food stamp benefits under a proposal unveiled Tuesday. The Trump administration said the rule was designed to eliminate ""loopholes,"" but it was immediately assailed by anti-poverty advocates.
Under the proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would no longer provide benefits to families solely because they are enrolled in food assistance programs run by the states where they live."
"About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.
The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close ""a loophole"" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.
""For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,""..."
"A day after going at each other in a third presidential debate, some Republican presidential candidates spent Thursday going after the debate process itself.
“It became irritating,” Marco Rubio told Fox News.
From “gotcha” questions that were deemed too snarky or biased to the crowded nature of the debate stage, some candidates said the Republican Party should consider changes to the format in the weeks and months ahead."
"Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein has been released on $1 million dollar bail, following his arraignment Friday.
He was charged in Manhattan court with rape, criminal sex act and other sex charges stemming from encounters with two women.
Accused by more than 80 women, Weinstein surrendered to the New York Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney's office Friday morning.
At the arraignment, Weinstein agreed to wear an electronic monitoring device, paid for at his own expense."
"More than 80 women have come forward to report sexual misconduct by producer Harvey Weinstein since October of last year. He has been fired from his company, kicked out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and pushed out of the Directors Guild of America. But Weinstein had never faced any criminal charges in connection with the many allegations of sexual harassment and assault against him. Until now.
Weinstein surrendered to authorities in New York the morning of Friday, May 25, and was arraigned shortly thereafter. Bond was..."
"'Everything is burning': History ablaze at Notre Dame
The famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris went up in flames Monday as shocked crowds gathered in the streets to watch one of the globe's most iconic churches burn. Smoke flowed from the 850-year-old structure before the cathedral's spire tumbled over, engulfed by flames. The fire burned basically unabated for hours despite hundreds of firefighters' efforts. It continued to glow when darkness fell. French President Emmanuel Macron summed up the emotions: ""I am sad tonight to see this part of all..."
"New York (CNN Business)In Paris, people gathered in plazas and street corners, eyes trained on the all-consuming fire. The rest of the world gathered via screens big and small. United in helplessness. Unsure of what to say. But compelled to watch.
Monday's outbreak of fire at the Notre Dame cathedral was first captured by the camera phones of tourists and local journalists.
One of the first social media posts came from a user named Ally, who tweeted a video of the smoke and wrote, in French, ""Smoke escapes from..."

"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a major reason that US drivers are paying record prices for gasoline. But it’s not the only cause of the spike.
Numerous factors are pushing prices up, with regular gasoline hitting a record $4.87 a gallon Monday according to AAA’s survey — up 25 cents a gallon in just the last week.

"Lawyers for the whistleblower behind the complaint related to President Donald Trump’s call with the leader of Ukraine said this weekend that they have “serious concerns” regarding their client’s safety.
In a letter addressed to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, the lead attorney for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj, alluded that the whistleblower is currently under federal protection.
The legal team, he wrote, only expects “this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers” who come forward.

"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump called on supporters Friday to ""liberate"" states that have experienced protests over coronavirus lockdowns, a day after he unveiled guidelines aimed at reopening the nation's economy.
Less than 24 hoursafter declining to name states he felt are prepared to begin easing social distancing guidelines to halt the spread of the virus, Trump named Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota as states that could benefit from what he described asliberation."
"When President Donald Trump tweeted ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA!"" on Friday morning, some of his most fervent supporters in far-right communities — including those who have agitated for violent insurrection — heard a call to arms.
The tweet was one of three sent from the president's account, along with ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"" and ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!"""

"The first major real-world study of the omicron Covid-19 variant found that it appeared to cause less severe illness in South Africa, where it was first discovered last month, but that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offer reduced protection against it.
The analysis, released Tuesday by the country's largest healthcare administrator, found that on average 29 percent fewer people were being admitted to hospital in the region than previously with the delta variant.  However, the study also found that two Pfizer jabs gave 70 percent protection against hospitalization from the new variant, compared with 90..."

Ahead of the report, most economists expected that payrolls gains would decrease in December after surging in November, when General Motors (GM) employees striking between September and October returned to work and pushed up results. But the end of the strike only accounted for a net revised 39,300 of November’s payroll gains in..."

One of the shooters is believed to have written a racist screed echoing some of Trump’s incendiary language about immigrants.
Bullock said Trump’s rhetoric and behavior —..."
"Britain has been through the wringer since last month’s mini-budget. Not only was Kwasi Kwarteng’s not-so-mini plan the trigger for a domestic financial crisis and higher mortgage costs for millions, it lit the blue touchpaper for his political downfall and that of his close friend, Liz Truss.
It was all supposed to be so different. Truss had spent the summer promising to cancel the rise in national insurance and corporation tax in the Conservative leadership race. Those pledges, plus her popular energy price freeze, would have been plenty for the new..."

"Should we all be wearing masks? That simple question is under review by officials in the U.S. government and has sparked a grass-roots pro-mask movement. But there’s still no consensus on whether widespread use of facial coverings would make a significant difference, and some infectious disease experts worry that masks could lull people into a false sense of security and make them less disciplined about social distancing.
In recent days, more people have taken to covering their faces, although it remains a scattershot strategy driven by personal choice. The government..."

"The cancellation Wednesday of a speech by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley was, according to a university spokesman, “not a proud night for this campus, the home of the free speech movement.” That’s putting it mildly. Even if the cancellation was justified by concerns about public safety after an outbreak of violence and property destruction, the fact that Yiannopoulos was prevented from speaking to a willing audience of campus Republicans should make supporters of free speech shiver.
In a characteristically knee-jerk reaction to Wednesday’s events, President Trump tweeted:..."
"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off Wednesday on the use of updated Covid-19 boosters for children as young as 5. Earlier in the day, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the shots’ emergency use authorization to include this age group.

"From Wall Street to the White House, everyone is watching GameStop shares.
What's happening: Stock in the left-for-dead video game retailer shot up an astonishing 135% to $347.51 on Wednesday, bringing gains since the start of January to 1,745%. In the battle between day traders coordinating on Reddit and legacy hedge funds betting GameStop shares will crash, the rag-tag internet crew is winning the day — at least for now.
It's not just about GameStop (GME) anymore. Shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC), Nokia (NOK), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and the..."
"Gov. John R. Kasich, a blunt-spoken and unorthodox Republican who bucked his party by expanding Medicaid under President Obama’s health care law and says politicians must “reach out and help those who live in the shadows,” is expected to announce Tuesday that he is joining his party’s long list of candidates for president.
Mr. Kasich, 63, would become the 16th prominent Republican to enter the 2016 field. As a two-term governor in a critical swing state — no candidate since John F. Kennedy in 1960 has won the White House..."
"BOSTON — As Samantha Shelton, an accomplished Harvard swimmer, churned through the water in the 100-yard women’s freestyle on Saturday afternoon, the University of Pennsylvania’s Lia Thomas seemed content to sit on her hip in the adjacent lane.
Shelton chugged ahead from the start, plowing through the water and carrying the lead. But as she did, Thomas cruised along beside her, seeming as unhurried as if on a training swim. Thomas’s broad shoulders and long arms, hallmark features of an elite swimmer, mimicked a windmill with the ease in which..."
"The one common thread is this presidential election is how much voters dislike the presumptive candidates of our political duopoly. The reality is — voters want more choices.
Sadly, one area where Republicans and Democrats are most willing to cooperate is stopping third party efforts with rules and regulations meant to protect the duopoly. One such reform in California now means many areas are effectively one-party states. For instance, my choice for Congress was limited to Republican A or Republican B. No other option allowed.
The big parties rig the..."
"President Trump's allies in the Senate are set to resume a public investigation on Wednesday that aims to tie former Vice President Joe Biden with what Republicans call abuses of power.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wants to question former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates about her actions and those of the Justice Department and FBI as President Barack Obama's era closed and Trump's began.
Yates headed the Justice Department for part of the time covered by the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and was..."
"The former deputy attorney general Sally Q. Yates on Wednesday adamantly defended the Justice Department’s investigation of Michael T. Flynn, clashing with Senate Republicans who accused her of being part of a politically motivated ploy by the Obama administration to frame President Trump’s former national security adviser.
In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ms. Yates described how top White House officials became deeply alarmed when they learned in the waning days of President Barack Obama’s tenure that the top national security adviser to the incoming president was conducting secretive..."

"The Pentagon under President-elect Joe Biden will face the same threats as it has under the Trump administration but will likely approach them in a different way, analysts say.
The Pentagon's massive $700 billion budget is unlikely to take deep cuts given those threats, they say. Clear breaks with Trump's approach to the military, however, are likely on social issues.
Trump's defense strategy, authored in large part by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, views China and Russia as the nation's principal adversaries with lesser threats posed by Iran, North Korea..."
"Legislation aimed at safeguarding abortion rights across the country failed in the Senate for the second time this year as a conservative majority on the Supreme Court prepares to strike down its landmark 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade.
The Women’s Health Protection Act would create federal protections for providing and accessing abortion services. The House already passed the bill, but Senate Republicans blocked it from advancing earlier this year.
Faced with few legislative options in the narrowly divided Senate, Democrats are hoping their renewed effort to codify abortion rights will..."
"Facebook and Twitter took action on Wednesday to limit the distribution of New York Post reporting with unconfirmed claims about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, leading President Trump's campaign and allies to charge the companies with censorship.
Both social media companies said the moves were aimed at slowing the spread of potentially false information. But they gave few details about how they reached their decisions, sparking criticism about the lack of clarity and consistency with which they apply their rules.
The New York Post published a series of stories on..."
"On Wednesday, Facebook and Twitter took steps to limit the spread of a controversial New York Post story about Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s son’s work in Ukraine—and in response, conservative figures are decrying the platforms for improperly censoring speech.
The unverified article claims that a “smoking gun” email shows Hunter Biden introducing his father to an executive at a Ukrainian company that Hunter used to work for. The information supposedly comes from a hard drive left at a computer repair shop in Delaware that made its way to Rudy Giuliani...."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday denounced school curricula that emphasize the impact of slavery and racism on American history and blamed “left-wing indoctrination” for nationwide protests against police brutality.
“Patriotic moms and dads are going to demand that their children are no longer fed hateful lies about this country,” Trump said in a speech at the National Archives in Washington."
"Many of us political scribes are sizing up the meaning of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office with long essays about foreign policy evolutions or executive orders or presidential temperament. But I thought: What better way to mark the milestone than with a good old-fashioned ranking—a list, from best to worst, smooth to chaotic, squeaky-clean to scandalous, of all the president’s days in the White House so far? So, I developed a highly subjective objective points system, and began to count."
"Neither Abraham Lincoln nor the Republican Party freed the slaves. They helped set freedom in motion and eventually codified it into law with the 13th Amendment, but they were not themselves responsible for the end of slavery. They were not the ones who brought about its final destruction.
Who freed the slaves? The slaves freed the slaves.
“Slave resistance,” as the historian Manisha Sinha points out in “The Slave’s Cause: A History of Abolition,” “lay at the heart of the abolition movement.”
“Prominent slave revolts marked the turn toward immediate..."
"The day after suffering a political blow in the Alabama special Senate election, congressional Republicans sped forward with the most sweeping tax rewrite in decades, announcing an agreement on a final bill that would cut taxes for businesses and individuals and signal the party’s first major legislative achievement since assuming political control this year."
"Two Pinocchios - The policy differences on Medicare are substantial, but that still does not justify using out-of-date figures from last years plan Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially because the plan has been updated and made more generous to deal with some of the original criticisms made by Democrats. The president should avoid claiming such specifics unless he can cite new data to make his case."
"The political battle over Medicare, brewing since Mitt Romney named Paul Ryan as his running mate, showed no signs of easing Sunday, with operatives from each campaign claiming their side had an advantage with senior citizens concerned about their government-funded health benefits.
Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom, speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" said his campaign wasn't worried that seniors would be turned off by Ryan's House budget plan, which proposes allowing private insurers to compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange."
"A historic deal was struck early Sunday between Iran and six world powers over Tehran's nuclear program that freezes the country's nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanction while a more formal agreement is worked out.
The agreement -- described as an ""initial, six-month"" deal -- includes ""substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address."
"The French and Iranian foreign ministers said early Sunday that a deal between six world powers and Iran has been struck that calls on Tehran to limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, ""Yes, we have a deal,"" as he walked past reporters crowding the hotel lobby where marathon negotiations had taken place over the past five days.
Asked if there was a deal, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said ""Yes"" and gave a thumbs up sign."
"North Korea conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on Friday, its government said, despite threats of more sanctions from the United States and the United Nations. The latest test, according to South Korean officials, produced a more powerful explosive yield than the North’s previous detonations, indicating that the country was making progress in its efforts to build a functional nuclear warhead."
"President Biden’s announcement this week of a deal to help Australia deploy nuclear-powered submarines has strained the Western alliance, infuriating France and foreshadowing how the conflicting American and European responses to confrontation with China may redraw the global strategic map.
In announcing the deal on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said it was meant to reinforce alliances and update them as strategic priorities shift. But in drawing a Pacific ally closer to meet the China challenge, he appears to have alienated an important European one and aggravated already tense relations with Beijing."
"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Portland’s nightly protests turned violent again even after the city’s mayor pleaded for demonstrators to stay off the streets and a police officer hit by a rock early Friday suffered what was described as a serious injury.
The protesters who came out Thursday night clashed with officers near a police precinct station and also used metal bars to disable police vehicles, police said in a statement.
The nightly clashes this week have ratcheted up tensions in the city after an agreement was reached last week between..."
"Perhaps Jared Kushner really believed that his New York real-estate skills set him up to bring peace to the Middle East, solve the opioid crisis, run a government SWAT team of business experts and protect his father-in-law from disloyal White House advisers. And that he could do it all while observing the Jewish Sabbath and reserving enough time for family ski vacations with Ivanka and their three children."
"Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday that laboratory tests suggest that three doses of their coronavirus vaccine offer significant protection against the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the virus.
The companies said that tests of blood from people who received only two doses found much lower antibody levels against the Omicron variant compared with an earlier version of the virus. That finding indicates that two doses alone “may not be sufficient to protect against infection” by the new variant, the companies said.
But the blood samples obtained from people one month after they..."
"Police have used tear gas to disperse large crowds protesting a new citizenship law in India's capital New Delhi just a day before US President Donald Trump begins a two-day visit of the country.
In the latest eruption of violence at protests on Sunday, hundreds of people supporting the new law clashed with those opposing it, with the two groups pelting each other with stones in the Maujpur area in the northeastern part of the city, according to television footage."
"The U.S. Secret Service is coming under intense scrutiny after a man who hopped the White House fence made it all the way through the front door before being apprehended.
President Barack Obama and his daughters had just departed the White House on Friday evening when an intruder scaled the north fence, darted across the lawn and into the presidential residence, where agents nabbed him. The security breach triggered a rare evacuation of much of the White House, with Secret Service officers drawing their guns as they rushed staffers and..."
"Some employees of The Walt Disney Company walked off the job Tuesday to protest what they said was the company's tepid response to a Florida bill that would restrict discussion of gender and sexuality in schools.
Hundreds of employees were seen marching out of the company's headquarters in Burbank, Calif., Tuesday morning, according to CNBC field producer Steve Desaulniers.
The full-scale walkout came after Disney employees planned a series of smaller walkouts during their 15-minute breaks to urge the company to take a stronger stance against the Parental Rights in Education legislation, which advocates have dubbed the ""Don't Say..."
"It’s no great credit to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he finally recused himself from all Justice Department investigations relating to the 2016 presidential campaign — and specifically from all current or future inquiries into Russian attempts to influence the election. Short of tendering his resignation, he had no other real choice."
"In an effort to slow the nation's contribution to climate change, President Biden will begin halting oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters.
The much-anticipated move is one of several executive actions the president is scheduled to make Wednesday to address the worsening climate crisis and the broader decline of the natural world, but it won't come without pushback.
According to White House officials, Biden will order the Department of the Interior to ""pause"" new oil and gas leasing on public land and offshore water ""to the extent..."
"In the most ambitious U.S. effort to stave off the worst effects of climate change, President Joe Biden is aiming to cut oil, gas and coal emissions and double energy production from offshore wind turbines through executive orders Wednesday.
The orders awaiting his signature target federal subsidies for oil and other fossil fuels and halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. They also intend to conserve 30 percent of the country’s lands and ocean waters in the next 10 years and move to an all-electric federal..."
"A coronavirus vaccine made by Maryland biotech company Novavax proved effective at stopping symptomatic infections in global hot spots where concerning variants are dominant, the company announced Thursday. But warning signs lurked amid those findings: The protective effect of the vaccine was substantially muted in South Africa, where a worrisome virus variant is in wide circulation.
The data, presented by a company news release, is ominous news for other vaccine developers. They have been scrambling to determine whether current vaccines would remain effective against the variant found in South Africa..."
"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon plans to divert $3.8 billion intended for military equipment to the construction of a wall at the southwestern border, it informed lawmakers on Thursday, drawing bipartisan outrage and reviving a long-running battle with Congress over funding for President Trump’s signature campaign promise.
The formal notification to Congress on Thursday, which was obtained by The New York Times, was the latest bid by Mr. Trump’s administration to circumvent congressional control of federal spending and unilaterally seize funds that lawmakers had designated for other purposes to finance the..."
"MUNICH, Germany (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday defended his decision to divert billions of dollars in funding for Navy and Air Force aircraft and other military programs to help pay for President Donald Trump’s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Esper was asked by a reporter about criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, who called the diversion of funds contrary to the constitutional authority of Congress.
“Border security is national security,” Esper said, “and national security is..."
"President Donald Trump's reelection campaign announced Sunday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will address this week's Republican National Convention—news that sparked swift criticism both because it's unprecedented for the nation's top diplomat to participate in this type of political event and because he will reportedlyspeak from ""an undisclosed location"" in Jerusalem while he's there on official travel.
Before meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, Pompeo—a former congressman from Kansas who previously served as CIA director under Trump—wrote Sunday on his personal Twitter account: ""Looking..."
"Democrats this week have the chance to validate their monopoly on political power in Washington, create a legacy of true significance for President Joe Biden and even boost their hopes in daunting midterm elections in three months.
But first they must push a back-from-the-dead climate and health care initiative through the Senate using their tiny majority, notably by locking in the crucial vote of moderate Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who has yet to sign off on a bill that may not save Democrats in November but may at least give them a big new win to..."
"The former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein defended during congressional testimony on Wednesday his decision to appoint a special counsel for the Trump-Russia investigation, as Republican allies of President Trump sought to keep a skeptical spotlight on the inquiry heading into the November election.
“I still believe it was the right decision under the circumstances,” Mr. Rosenstein said to the Senate Judiciary Committee about appointing Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel. “I recognize that people can criticize me for them. That’s the consequence of being in these jobs,..."
"A commercial flight took off from Kabul airport on Thursday for the first time since the Taliban seized Afghanistan, hours after the militants cleared a group of Americans and other foreign nationals to leave the country.
It is unclear at this stage whether or how many Americans were on board the Qatar Airways flight, reported earlier to be bound for Doha, or the nationalities of the other passengers.
A US official and a source with knowledge of the matter had earlier said the Taliban had cleared around 200 people, including..."
"Some 200 foreigners, including Americans, left Afghanistan on a commercial flight out of Kabul on Thursday, the first such large-scale departure since U.S. and other forces completed their frantic withdrawal over a week ago.
The Qatar Airways flight to Doha marked a breakthrough in the bumpy coordination between the U.S. and Afghanistan’s new Taliban rulers. A dayslong standoff over charter planes at another airport has left dozens of passengers stranded.
A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media, provided..."
"John Ratcliffe, the Texas congressman whose bid to be director of national intelligence fell apart last summer amid evidence he exaggerated his biography, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday that if confirmed he would “speak truth to power” and protect spy agencies from political pressure.
“Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,” Ratcliffe said in opening remarks at his confirmation hearing in the Capitol. “Above all, my fidelity and..."
"Voters in Chicago on Tuesday elected former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot to become their next mayor, making Chicago the largest city to elect an African-American woman as its top elected official.
With votes in 95% of precincts counted, Lightfoot had 73.7% of the vote and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle 26.3%.
The win by Lightfoot, who identifies as a lesbian and will be Chicago’s first woman of color to serve as mayor, also means the Windy City is the biggest U.S. city to pick an openly gay mayor.
""Out..."
"Former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot took home the victory in Chicago's mayoral race on Tuesday, making her the city's first African American female mayor.
The 56-year-old political newcomer defeated Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, a 72-year-old former school teacher with nearly two decades of experience in public office.
The two Democrats took the lead in a crowded field of 14 candidates in the February general election to succeed two-term Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel was not seeking re-election.
Lightfoot, also slated to become the city's first openly gay mayor, will..."
"A shooting that erupted in the early hours of Wednesday morning at a light rail maintenance yard in San Jose, California, has left at least nine people dead, including the gunman.
Local leaders have described the violence as a “terrible, terrible” tragedy as authorities search for a motive.
Authorities reported on Wednesday that there were about 40 people at the facility at the time the shootings occurred and the gunfire erupted in two separate buildings. Police say the shooter was an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority, which operates the light..."
"President Biden will announce new steps on Tuesday to confront a staggering surge in coronavirus cases, including readying 1,000 military medical professionals to help at overburdened hospitals, setting up new federal testing sites, deploying hundreds of federal vaccinators and buying 500 million rapid tests to distribute free to the public.
The measures, outlined to reporters Monday night by two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, come as coronavirus caseloads are rapidly rising around the country, particularly in the Northeast, fueled by the highly infectious new Omicron variant..."
"President Obama has vetoed the first bill sent to him by Congress this year, a symbolic attempt by Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund abortion provider Planned Parenthood in an election year.
""Republicans in the Congress have attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act over 50 times,"" Obama said in a veto message Friday. ""Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the"
"President Barack Obama notified Congress on Friday that he has vetoed their legislation to repeal huge parts of the Affordable Care Act, because of course he did.
Republicans celebrated this week after finally managing to push a repeal bill through the House and Senate for the first time, reveling in their impending failure to actually achieve anyth"
"A federal judge in San Francisco late Monday blocked new rules put into place by President Donald Trump that limit the ability of migrants to request asylum, a legal blow to the administration's efforts to curb legal immigration that opens the door for more members of the migrant caravan to request asylum in the U.S."
"In the first debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump repeatedly relied on troublesome and false facts that have been debunked throughout the campaign. Clinton stretched the truth on occasion, such as when she tried to wiggle out of her 2012 praise of the Trans Pacific Partnership as a “gold standard.” But her misstatements paled in comparison to the list of Trump’s exaggerations and falsehoods."
"Far-right Rep. Lauren Boebert defeated her more moderate challenger in the Republican primary for Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District on Tuesday, NBC News projected.
With virtually all of the expected vote counted, Boebert led state Sen. Don Coram by nearly 30 points.
Boebert, backed by former President Donald Trump, has made a number of inflammatory remarks, and she has positioned herself as one of the most far-right members of Congress — winning herself national attention in the process. Earlier this year, Boebert and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., heckled President Joe Biden at various..."
"On March 25, Tara Reade, a former Senate aide for Joseph R. Biden Jr., alleged in an interview on a podcast that Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had sexually assaulted her in 1993.
The New York Times did not immediately report the allegation.
More than two weeks later, on April 12, The Times published an article by Lisa Lerer and Sydney Ember that included an interview with Ms. Reade detailing her claims. The article reported that a friend said that Ms. Reade had recounted the details of the..."
"WASHINGTON — The offer: A $1 million check from a major Democratic donor to a major Democratic group. The one condition: The money would be refunded if Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren becomes the party's nominee.
That offer was rejected, according to an official familiar with it, but it was indicative of the larger anxiety felt by many in the Democratic Party's elite circles about the state of the 2020 Democratic presidential field. ""Ninety to 95 percent of our donor base is terrified about Warren,"" said a prominent Democratic official.
Democrats,..."
"Not long after the coronavirus bore down on New York last year, gun violence surged, rising nearly 75 percent in the state’s largest cities. But even as the virus receded in recent months, shootings continued to rise.
On Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a new state of emergency around gun violence and committed almost $139 million to reverse the trend of rising shootings and murders across the state.
The emergency declaration, which the governor said was the first by a state to address gun violence, would allow New York..."
"The annual U.S. inflation rate was little changed in September, hitting 8.2% year-over-year compared with August's 8.3% reading as the pace of price increases remains at multidecade highs, causing pain for many U.S. households.
High prices for food, shelter and medical care sent the consumer price index for September up by 0.4% compared to August's 0.1%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning.
Inflation remains at the top of Americans' minds going into the last quarter of a year that has seen across-the-board volatility in food, gasoline..."
"A former aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told the House January 6 committee that then-President Donald Trump had suggested to Meadows he approved of the ""hang Mike Pence"" chants from rioters who stormed the US Capitol, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
Cassidy Hutchinson, the former aide, also testified that Trump complained about his then-vice president being hustled to safety while Trump supporters breached the Capitol, the sources said.
Hutchinson has answered the panel's questions during three separate sessions, CNN previously reported. She went over ""new ground"" with the committee..."
"As the midterm primary season comes to an end, candidates endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump have continued to rack up wins, but with a handful of prominent losses.
Of the more than 200 Republicans Mr. Trump has backed this year, many ran unopposed or faced little-known opponents. He has also waited to make some endorsements until a front-runner emerged, as with his last-minute endorsement of Tudor Dixon for governor of Michigan.
Several of his candidates were defeated in early primaries, including in Georgia and North Carolina; more recently,..."
"The former Minnesota police officer who was captured on camera fatally shooting Daunte Wright during a traffic stop was arrested in connection with Wright's death, authorities said Wednesday.
Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, was taken into custody about 11:30 a.m. at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in St. Paul, officials said. She will be charged with second-degree manslaughter in connection with Wright's death, Washington County Attorney Pete Orput announced.
Wright, who is Black, died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according the Hennepin..."
"The tables have turned in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
After three days of arguments from the House impeachment managers, the President's legal team has taken over the Senate floor to deliver their side of the story, detailing the defense of the President against the two articles of impeachment.
""You heard the House managers speak for nearly 24 hours over three days,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone said on the floor of the Senate as he began his remarks. ""We don't anticipate using that much time.""

"Donald Trump has always been a man of absolutes.
Something is the best or the worst, a person is a winner or a total loser, an event has never happened before, even when it has.
Absolutism was the unwritten credo of his career in business and is the guiding light of his presidency as he makes an assertion rarely heard from an American president: that he can do as he pleases.
Now that approach faces its ultimate test as a foundation of Trump’s defense in his impeachment trial, namely that..."
Wisconsin Republicans seem to have it all. Native son Paul Ryan is Mitt Romneys running mate. Gov. Scott Walker is a national conservative hero after surviving a recall vote. Former Gov. Tommy Thompson is vying to capture an open Senate seat held for more than 50 years by Democrats. And Wisconsins own Reince Priebus heads the Republican National Committee.
"Neil Young has never been quiet about his hatred of streaming, Big Tech, or the digitization of the music experience in general. But the veteran rocker escalated the crusade earlier this week, when he posted (and then deleted) a letter on his website asking his manager and an executive at his label, Warner Bros., to pull his entire catalog from Spotify. Artists have long criticized the streaming platform for not compensating musicians fairly, but Young cited a different reason for his action: Joe Rogan. The most popular podcaster in the world has been trafficking in..."
"Donald Trump met with Mitt Romney, once a fierce critic of the president-elect who is now being floated as a potential pick for secretary of state, on Saturday afternoon, setting aside the friction between the two men and signaling a willingness by Trump to entertain different points of view on foreign policy."
"The US will impose sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House announced Friday.
The Russian leader will become the highest-profile target in the effort to impose costs on the Russian economy and Putin's inner circle in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Additional Russian officials are likely to be included, one source familiar with the matter said."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders and his Medicare-for-all proposal were again the targets of attacks at Tuesday’s Democratic debate in South Carolina, but the senator had a retort for opponents who doubt his single-payer plan would work: a brand-new study published in The Lancet.
The study, authored by a group of Yale researchers, came to two conclusions that Sanders touted during the debate. Under Medicare-for-all, the researchers found, the United States would spend $3 trillion on health care annually, or about $460 billion less than the country spent in 2017 under the..."
"The Justice Department’s top watchdog blasted the FBI for a series of “fundamental errors” in its probe of a Trump campaign official but said it found no evidence that political bias fueled the investigation.
Less than an hour after the long-awaited findings from Inspector General Michael Horowitz were released, a federal prosecutor conducting a separate investigation of the FBI’s action—and reporting directly to Attorney General Bill Barr—pushed back.
“Our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department,” John Durham, the U.S. attorney in..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conflating the results of two different types of coronavirus tests, distorting several important metrics and providing the country with an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic. We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government’s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country’s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. The..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged that it is mixing the results of two different kinds of tests in the agency's tally of testing for the coronavirus, raising concerns among some scientists that it could be creating an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic in the United States.
The CDC combines the results of genetic tests that spot people who are actively infected, mostly by using a process known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, with results from another, known as serology testing, which looks..."
"The Supreme Court has scheduled same-sex marriage cases from five states for consideration at its private conference Monday, indicating no hesitation to dive right into the national debate.
The justices placed cases from Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin on the list for their first conference of the 2014 term. They could have delved into some or none, preferring to wait until later in the fall.
By scheduling all for consideration simultaneously, the justices gave equal footing to the Indiana and Wisconsin cases just decided last month by the U.S...."
"A Supreme Court term that is starting with a lack of headline-grabbing cases may end with a blockbuster that helps define the legacy of the court under Chief Justice John Roberts.
While same-sex marriage is not yet on their agenda, the justices appear likely to take on the issue and decide once and for all whether gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry.
When the justices formally open their new term Monday, Roberts will be beginning his 10th year at the head of the court, and the..."
"Chris Cuomo has announced he’ll return to hosting a prime-time cable news show at the much smaller NewsNation network this fall after he was dismissed from CNN last year.
The announcement came at the end of an interview with Dan Abrams on NewsNation’s “Dan Abrams Live.” The hourlong interview included discussions about his ouster from CNN after he was found to have inappropriately helped his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), respond to multiple sexual harassment allegations.
NewsNation, launched in September 2020 by Nexstar Media Group, reaches a much smaller audience..."
"Liz Cheney sees a winning strategy where none of her conference colleagues will go.
On Monday morning, a political action committee for Donald Trump—a film extra who served as president of the United States from 2017 to 2021—released a statement saying that “The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!” The rebranding edict was directed to no one in particular. But among the prominent politicians who chose to respond to it was Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking member and chair..."
"Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who has served in President Obama’s Cabinet since Day One of his administration, announced Friday that she would step down to become president of the University of California system.
Napolitano’s departure has been in the works for several months, and she plans to leave her post in early September, according to two administration officials.

"The U.S. will ban the downloads of the Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat on Sunday, with a total ban on the use of the latter, citing national security and data privacy concerns.
A total ban on the use of TikTok will follow on Nov. 12, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place.
“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal..."
"The Trump administration said Friday that it will block people in the United States from downloading popular Chinese-owned apps TikTok and WeChat starting Sunday. Both apps are used by over 100 million people in the country.
According to a US Department of Commerce order, new downloads of the apps will be banned from US app stores as of September 20. WeChat, an app popular with Chinese nationals in the United States, will also be banned from hosting content, processing payments within the US, and sending money to other WeChat users..."
"effrey Epstein, the financier who apparently hanged himself in a federal jail in Manhattan, was supposed to have been checked by guards every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not being followed the night before he was found, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said.
In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail’s normal procedure, two officials said."
"One presidential candidate and her husband made $30 million since the start of 2014 giving paid speeches.
One ran a Fortune 500 company and recently revealed she and her husband had a net worth of $59 million. Another is so wealthy he bragged of owning a Gucci store that was worth more than 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
Another worked for multiple multinational banks that earned him millions and was born to a moneyed political dynasty.
Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, recently had to liquidate a retirement fund..."
"So, who's got their dander up, in the world of the 2016 election? By the looks of things, it's Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, who was hopping mad on Tuesday at The New York Times. Congratulations to him, for earning his ""Beefing with the Times"" merit badge, a GOP tradition.
What happened? Well, the Times published an article that takes a rather robust look at Rubio's personal financial dealings, documenting ""a series of decisions over the past 15 years that experts called imprudent."" There's a litany of said decisions..."
"President Trump suffered multiple legal setbacks in three key swing states on Friday, choking off many of his last-ditch efforts to use the courts to delay or block President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory.
In quick succession, Mr. Trump was handed defeats in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan, where a state judge in Detroit rejected an unusual Republican attempt to halt the certification of the vote in Wayne County pending an audit of the count."
"This weekend’s March for Life rally, the large anti-choice demonstration held annually in Washington DC to mark the anniversary of the Roe v Wade decision, has the exuberant quality of a victory lap. This, the 49th anniversary of Roe, is likely to be its last. The US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, which is set to be decided this spring. For women in Texas, Roe has already been nullified: the court went out of its way to allow what Justice Sonia Sotomayor..."
"It has been around two months of quarantine for many of us. The urge to get out and enjoy the summer is real. But what's safe? We asked a panel of infectious disease and public health experts to rate the risk of summer activities, from backyard gatherings to a day at the pool to sharing a vacation house with another household.
One big warning: Your personal risk depends on your age and health, the prevalence of the virus in your area and the precautions you take during any of these..."
"Since coronavirus lockdowns began in the US, most Americans have drastically changed their patterns: following instructions to stay home, limiting almost all contact with others, and venturing out only for essential trips and exercise.
As states begin to ease social distancing restrictions, people are beginning to have more options. Between those wanting to patronize newly reopened businesses or socialize in person, and more employers calling people back to work, survey and cellphone data suggests people are already starting to trickle out of their homes.
But for many people, it’s really..."
"Rep. Liz Cheney said Sunday that the House Jan. 6 select committee has enough evidence to refer former President Donald Trump for criminal charges.
But the panel hasn’t made a decision on how to proceed on a referral, Cheney (R-Wyo.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Her acknowledgment follows a Sunday report in the New York Times that said the committee is divided on whether to move forward with the largely symbolic act, as some members of the panel worry it would unnecessarily politicize the Justice Department’s investigation into Jan. 6..."
"President Trump went on a “nasty diatribe” during a Wednesday meeting on the increasingly volatile situation in Syria, calling Nancy Pelosi a “third-rate politician"" to her face and acting in an overall “appalling” manner, the House speaker and other Democratic leaders said after storming out of the tense sit-down.
Speaking immediately after ditching the hostile Cabinet Room standoff, Pelosi said Trump suffered a “meltdown” after she pointed out that the House had just overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning his recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria — a decision..."
"It seems increasingly likely that Jeb Bush will run for president. (Even his son is talking up the prospects.) What remains to be seen is whether Jeb Bush can actually win.
A lot of GOP establishment types are excited about a Bush candidacy. But don't expect the grassroots to eagerly embrace a former Florida governor who has made a habit of moderately breaking from conservative orthodoxy on big issues like immigration, or who recently (mildly) singled out Fox News for criticism. As the editor of the Washington Free Beacon said"
"When Jeb Bush decides whether to run for president, there will be no family meeting à la Mitt Romney, no gathering at Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport to go over the pros and cons. “I don’t think it’ll be like a big internal straw poll,” said his son, Jeb Bush Jr.
But if there were, the results of the poll are pretty much in. As Mr. Bush nears a decision to become the third member of his storied family to seek the presidency, the extended Bush clan and its attendant network,..."
"A U.S. Army soldier stationed overseas has been charged with passing along information about his unit's planned deployment overseas, intending it to get extremist groups to attack it.
Army Private Ethan Phelan Melzer, 22, of Louisville, Kentucky, faces a host of federal attempted murder charges, handed up Monday by a federal grand jury, that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. John Demers, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's national security division said Melzer ""planned a deadly ambush on his fellow soldiers in the service of..."
"Two police officers in Wisconsin were placed on administrative leave after video showed a Black father being shot multiple times in the back at close range as he tried to enter a vehicle.
Protests broke out in Kenosha, Wis., a witness recorded the moment police officers followed a man identified by officials as 29-year-old Jacob Blake to a SUV after responding to a domestic incident. Neighbors said Blake was trying to break up a fight between two women, according to the Kenosha News.
One of the officers can be seen..."
"US oil prices briefly tumbled below $100 a barrel on Monday, unwinding a significant chunk of the recent spike caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil plunged more than 8%, touching a low of $99.76 a barrel. That means oil has lost almost roughly quarter of its value since touching a near 14-year high of $130.50 a barrel on March 6.
It's the first time oil has traded below $100 since March 1.
""This is one hell of a correction,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price..."
"A missile hit a crowded train station in eastern Ukraine that was an evacuation point for civilians, killing dozens of people, Ukrainian authorities said Friday after warning they expected even worse evidence of war crimes in parts of the country previously held by Russian troops.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that thousands of people were at the train station when the missile struck. The Russian Defense Ministry denied targeting the station in Kramatorsk, a city in the eastern Donetsk region, but Zelenskyy blamed Russia for the bodies lying in what looked like an outdoor..."
"At least 30 people, including two children, were killed after Russian forces carried out a missile strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that was being used by civilians trying to flee the fighting, Ukrainian officials said Friday.
Tetiana Ihnatchenko, a spokeswoman for the region of Donetsk where the attack took place, said that first responders had confirmed the initial casualty figures and warned the numbers were likely to rise.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said later that nearly 300 people have been wounded in the strike and that..."
"It’s a stressful time to work in the White House, as a small outbreak leaves contact tracers unsure of how two West Wing staffers contracted the coronavirus. According to his performance at Monday’s COVID-19 press conference, the president is taking the workplace anxiety to heart — that, or his standard behavior toward female journalists and open biases toward Asian and Asian-American reporters were reaffirmed in the Rose Garden.
It began when CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who is Chinese-American, asked Trump about why he appears to consider individual..."
"President Donald Trump and a CBS News White House correspondent had a tense exchange on Monday during a White House press conference at the Rose Garden.
Trump on Monday spoke in front of a large sign that said ""AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD IN TESTING"" and gave a glowing assessment of the country's efforts to test its citizens for the coronavirus.
""If people want to get tested, they get tested,"" Trump said.
The Trump administration regularly says the US leads other countries in the number of coronavirus tests administered. While the..."
"The journalistic juices are now flowing, with the editorial pages of The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Orlando Sentinel, Philadelphia Inquirer, and USA Today all calling for impeachment of President Donald Trump.
But the recent flurry of editorials hasn’t come close to the level two decades ago when more than 115 newspaper boards called for President Bill Clinton’s resignation after the release of independent counsel Ken Starr’s report, which took place two months before articles were officially drawn up in Congress. And the half-dozen or so editorial boards..."
"The headline the New York Times editorial board settled on was simple: “Impeach.”
The same could be said of the “damning” case laid out against President Trump, the Times said Saturday, as it joined a growing roster of more than a dozen national and regional newspapers that argue that the Senate should take up convincing accusations of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
The opinions of major publications are divided as the House prepares for a historic vote Wednesday, and a host of traditionally more-conservative editorial boards have yet to weigh in..."
"The European Union on Tuesday approved a package of expanded sanctions against Russia over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow has been widely accused of supporting separatist rebels.
The new sanctions target Russia’s state-owned banks, and will restrict sales to Russia of arms, some kinds of technology and some equipment used by the oil industry. European diplomats also drew up a list of people who will face individual sanctions, including at least three close associates of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia."
"W. Mondale Robinson spent a large chunk of last fall in clubs and bars and concert venues in Georgia, trying to convince disenchanted Black men that casting a ballot — in the 2020 general election, then the Georgia runoffs for the U.S. Senate — could finally mean real change in their communities.
But Robinson, founder of the Black Male Voter Project, thinks the case would be a lot harder to make now. He remembers the exact moment his optimism that President Biden would be different began to fade: when Democrats in..."
"The U.S. economy added just 266,000 jobs in April — a mere fraction of economists’ expectations of nearly a million, and unemployment ticked up instead of dropping as predicted. According to economists, this is a clear sign that there are still giant holes in America’s economic recovery and that the coronavirus remains in the driver’s seat.
With vaccination rates slowing even as local economies fully reopen, the job market is reorienting itself into a new normal that assumes the virus might linger for the foreseeable future — a shift that..."
"Inside a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, a white man with a history of antisemitic internet posts gunned down 11 worshipers, blaming Jews for allowing immigrant “invaders” into the United States.

"The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate by one-quarter of a point on Wednesday, the second time this year it has reduced rates in the face of a weakening global economy.
The central bank's new interest rate is now 1.75 percent to 2 percent, according to a statement issued after a two-day monetary policy meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee, the voting arm of the Fed.
While President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for rates of ""ZERO or less"" — a move he believes will boost the economy..."
"The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate again, big news for the U.S. economy but something that will likely have a muted impact on Americans’ personal finances, experts say.
That’s because the reduction doesn’t offset the increases of recent years. And as the key rate creeps closer to zero, financial institutions are less eager to pass borrowing benefits along. Lower rates could also further dampen the perks of savings.
As a reminder, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate — which affects a host of consumer and business loans..."
"House Speaker John Boehner says he doesn't know if the forced spending cuts that began taking effect Friday will actually have a negative impact, although he argued in a recent op-ed that the sequester would threaten ""U.S. national security, thousands of jobs and more.""
""I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not,"" he said in an interview that aired Sunday. ""I don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to"
"House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offered different views of the sequester cuts that took effect late Friday night after lawmakers failed to reach a deal to avoid them.
On NBC's Meet The Press, Boehner criticized the cuts, calling them ""silly"" and ""random.""
""I am concerned about its impact on our economy and its impact on our military. Listen, we've known about his problem for 16 months. We've known the sequester was coming,"" he said. ""I’ve watched leaders from both parties kick this can down the..."
"Republicans began their nominating convention Monday with dark denunciations of Democrats and warnings about a future controlled by “radical liberals,” while praising President Trump’s stewardship of the country, including his handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 173,000 Americans.
The night’s program also served as a response to attacks on Trump’s character and accusations of racism by featuring testimonials from Black supporters, the grieving parent of a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting victim and a cancer survivor.

"The family of Michael Brown will file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, and former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, an attorney for the family announced Thursday.
The news comes just one day after the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced its decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for fatally shooting Brown last July.
In a press conference, family attorney Anthony Gray expressed the family’s disappointment in the Justice Department’s decision and announced the next legal actions they plan to take."
Michael Brown's family said it plans to bring a civil lawsuit for the wrongful death of their son against Darren Wilson and the city of Ferguson. The announcment came a day after the Justice Department released its report on the abuses of the police department and said Wilson wouldn't be charged for violating Brown's civil rights. Brown family attorneys note that the burden of proof is lower in a civil case than the criminal cases that were considered by both the federal government and a St. Louis County grand jury.
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday ended the most popular forms of U.S. travel to Cuba, banning cruise ships and a heavily used category of educational travel in an attempt to cut off cash to the island’s communist government.
Cruise travel from the U.S. to Cuba began in May 2016 during President Barack Obama’s opening with the island. It has become the most popular form of U.S. leisure travel to the island, bringing 142,721 people in the first four months of the year, a more than 300% increase..."
"(CNN)The US announced major new restrictions on US citizens traveling to Cuba on Tuesday, blocking the most common way Americans are able to visit the island -- through organized tour groups that license US citizens to travel automatically -- and banning US cruise ships from stopping in the country.
American tourism is not explicitly permitted in Cuba. However, Americans can travel to Cuba if it is covered under specific categories, which included organized group travel, known as group people-to-people travel, until Tuesday.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the..."

"President Trump caused a stir Wednesday by advising his supporters in North Carolina to attempt to vote twice. This would be, if completed and done intentionally, illegal. What’s more, North Carolina state law also makes it a Class I felony “to induce” someone to do this.
The pushback from Trump’s allies is familiar: He was joking. And that’s plausible! It’s entirely possible Trump was speaking somewhat in jest to make a point about the supposed lack of security in mail-in voting, which he has routinely attacked in hyperbolic ways. The..."
"Mayor Bill de Blasio lashed out at Hasidic residents of the Williamsburg section in Brooklyn late Tuesday night after personally overseeing the dispersal of a crowd of hundreds of mourners who had gathered for the funeral of a rabbi who died of the coronavirus.

Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC aligned with Clinton, brought in $9.3 million in July, giving it a total of $110 million for the 2016 cycle, according to new campaign finance reports filed Saturday. The group headed into August with nearly $39 million in the bank.
The robust fundraising is due to huge donations from..."
"Two megadonors accounted for almost two-thirds of the contributions to the main super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton in July, as the group's income slowed slightly from the month before.
Investors Daniel Abraham and Donald Sussman each gave $3 million to Priorities USA Action. The super PAC's total haul was $9.9 million, down from $11.9 million in June. The group finished July with $38.7 million cash on hand.
The super PAC has been spending aggressively on a torrent of ads attacking Republican nominee Donald Trump, including about a half-million..."

"Roughly 39 million American families will begin receiving the first of six monthly installments of the enhanced child tax credit payments on Thursday, providing at least temporary relief for households living below the poverty line.
The program is part of the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion economic aid package called the American Rescue Plan that was passed in March. It increases the existing tax benefit from $2,000 up to $3,600 for younger kids and $3,000 for older ones, for the 2021 tax year.
It also broadens the umbrella of who's eligible for the full refund...."

"Drugmaker Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected efficacy if the trend continues.
The so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of the cases were in people who had been..."

A top Justice Department lawyer, in a letter to the court, reversed the government’s position in a case argued last November and in which a decision has not been announced.

I also don’t know what, if anything, can be saved from the Build Back Better framework.

Let’s take them one at a time:
Can we locate and tie up the wealth of Russian oligarchs?
Anecdotally, sanctions on the oligarchs appear to be working. Last Sunday, the billionaire industrialist..."

In key statewide races and local contests in the Democratic strongholds of San Francisco and Los Angeles, tough-on-crime messaging and calls to remove homeless encampments are taking hold, testing the staying power of the criminal justice reform movement that swept the nation in recent years.
The issues have sparked a recall election targeting San Francisco’s district attorney,..."
"The Supreme Court may soon be ready to overturn the only federal abortion protections in the country, according to a draft of an opinion obtained by Politico. The court is expected to announce its ruling, on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, sometime before July.
“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” the draft document says, citing two landmark Supreme Court rulings protecting the right to abortion, the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision. Together, they establish a constitutional right to an abortion until about 24 weeks into a pregnancy, or when..."
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday issued another executive order cracking down on COVID-19 vaccine mandates — this time banning any entity in Texas, including private businesses, from requiring vaccinations for employees or customers.
Abbott also called on the Legislature to pass a law with the same effect, promising to rescind the executive order once that happened. The Legislature is in this year's third special legislative session, which ends Oct. 19.

"J.K. Rowling has cast a spell of controversy.
The ""Harry Potter"" author has come under fire for tweeting a message of support Thursday for Maya Forstater, a researcher who lost her job at a think tank for stating that people cannot change their biological sex.
""Dress however you please,"" Rowling wrote. ""Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill"""
"J.K. Rowling spent Thursday once again demonstrating a perplexing inability to pipe down and enjoy her millions. This time, the Harry Potter author wasn’t retconning diversity into the series she finished writing over 12 years ago or disclosing that before indoor plumbing, the wizards of her universe used to just poop themselves and magically vanish the evidence away. Instead, Rowling tweeted her support for Maya Forstater, a tax expert whose firing from a think tank over transphobic comments and subsequent court battle has generated a great deal of controversy in..."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump backed away from further military confrontation with Iran on Wednesday after a barrage of missiles fired at American troops killed no one and Tehran indicated that would be the end of its retaliation for the killing of a top general.
“Iran appears to be standing down which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” Mr. Trump said in a televised statement from the Grand Foyer of the White House, flanked by his vice president, cabinet secretaries and..."
"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump addressed the nation from the Grand Foyer of the White House hours after Iran rained more than a dozen rockets down on airbases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. Iranians said the attack was in response to a U.S. drone strike last week that killed Qasem Soleimani, one of Tehran’s most powerful leaders.

"In an era of maddeningly careful politics, Gov. Chris Christie rocketed to national stardom as brazenly incautious. His excesses defined him: the scorching rants, the seductive oversharing, the caustic insults and endless public feuds.
Harmless theatrics, he said.
But the in-your-face instincts and boundary-breaking behavior that Mr. Christie brought to public life found a vindictive host in the fiercely loyal circle around him, as the federal indictment of a top appointee and a former deputy chief of staff in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal la"
"Friday was a bad day for Chris Christie.
But it could have been a whole lot worse.
The indictments of two former Christie allies in connection to their involvement in the Bridgegate scandal, and a guilty plea from a third, cast a harsh, unflattering light on the New Jersey governor. They rose troubling questions about his administration, and about whether Christie had propagated an environment in which political retaliation wasn’t just tolerated, but was standard operating procedure.

Simply put, Democrats lack the support in..."
"When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed voting restrictions last year, he gave exclusive access to this glorious spectacle to Fox News. It was a twofer for the national right-wing audience, flaunting his relish of voter suppression while sticking it to mainstream Fake News outlets in the process.
Now DeSantis has produced another made-for-Fox moment: He is taking credit for delivering two planeloads of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, where locals are scrambling to meet their needs. DeSantis’s staff apparently supplied exclusive video of these heroics to Fox: It shows the migrants, some children, disembarking from planes, and..."
"In a bill introduced this past week, a Louisiana lawmaker describes human life as ""created in the image of God"" and seeks to make abortion a homicide from the moment of fertilization – sparking concerns from reproductive rights advocates that such a law would also jeopardize access to contraception and fertility treatments.
Debates around abortion often center around the issue of when life begins, and adjacent religious and moral questions. It came up during oral arguments last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a major abortion case currently before the Supreme Court.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked..."
"America’s faithful are bracing — some with cautionary joy and others with looming dread — for the Supreme Court to potentially overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and end the nationwide right to legal abortion.
A reversal of the 49-year-old ruling has never felt more possible since a draft opinion suggesting justices may do so was leaked this week. While religious believers at the heart of the decades-old fight over abortion are shocked at the breach of high court protocol, they are still as deeply divided and their beliefs on the contentious..."
"The epidemic of gun violence in our country is a crisis. Gun deaths and injuries constitute one of the greatest threats to public health and to the safety of the American people. Every year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children. We’re the only advanced nation on earth that sees this kind of mass violence with this frequency."

"In a new approach to gun control inspired by Texas’s controversial approach to banning most abortions, California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced that his administration will work to make it easier for private citizens to sue people who sell assault rifles and parts for untraceable ghost guns.

"California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday he is working on a bill that would help private citizens sue manufacturers, distributors, and sellers of assault weapons or ghost gun kits.
Newsom said he was responding to a Supreme Court decision made Friday that allowed a controversial abortion law in Texas to stand. The law bans all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and invites ordinary citizens, rather than state officials, to enforce it by suing abortion providers or anyone who helps someone get an abortion.
The court's decision was technical, Insider's Oma Seddiq reported..."

"For two years, people in China have largely tolerated living under some of the world’s most stringent Covid-19 controls.
Restricted borders, constant digital tracking, and the potential for mass testing and snap lockdowns whenever a handful of cases appeared were all trade-offs for a comparatively Covid-free life while the pandemic raged overseas.
But China’s inability to bring its latest outbreak under control so far has prompted online rumblings from frustrated citizens, as questions about Beijing’s zero-Covid strategy break into the mainstream for the first time.

"Among all the ways that COVID-19 affects our lives, the pandemic confronts us with a profound moral dilemma:
How should we react to the deaths of the unvaccinated?
On the one hand, a hallmark of civilized thought is the sense that every life is precious.
On the other, those who have deliberately flouted sober medical advice by refusing a vaccine known to reduce the risk of serious disease from the virus, including the risk to others, and end up in the hospital or the grave can be viewed as receiving..."

But Karl Rove's insistence that Barack Obama had not carried Ohio -- despite the call by his own network, Fox News, that the president had done just that -- represented something larger. It captured, for some long and awkward moments, the refusal of some in the media-and-politics game to accept reality.

He went on to explain that the lengthy contest featured ""way too many debates'' and became overly focused on social issues instead of the economy.

"The United States has threatened to sanction Russia if it invades Ukraine.
But, what, exactly those sanctions might look like — and how punishing they might be — will depend not just on what Russia does, but on the costs the United States and its allies, especially in Europe, are prepared to withstand.
This is the dilemma facing the United States, which has ruled out deploying forces to Ukraine. The most aggressive sanctions, like making it extraordinarily difficult for Russian financial institutions and state-owned banks to trade in US dollars, could inflict a lot..."

"Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday eulogized slain NYPD officer Rafael Ramos, who was shot dead ""execution style"" by a man who posted on social media that he wanted revenge for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.
""The time will come when Rafael’s memory will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eyes,"" Biden told Ramos' family. ""I speak for the whole nation when I say our hearts ache for you.""
The funeral, which was held in Queens, was attended by thousands of police..."
"Abortion, guns and religion — a major change in the law in any one of these areas would have made for a fateful Supreme Court term. In its first full term together, the court’s conservative majority ruled in all three and issued other significant decisions limiting the government’s regulatory powers.
And it has signaled no plans to slow down.
With former President Donald Trump’s appointees in their 50s, the six-justice conservative majority seems poised to keep control of the court for years to come, if not decades.
“This has been a revolutionary term in so many..."
"Michigan’s attorney general is exploring whether officials there risk committing crimes if they bend to President Trump’s wishes in seeking to block the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in their state, according to two people familiar with the review.
The move by Dana Nessel, a Democrat, reflected a growing sense of unease among many in her party and some Republicans that the president was continuing his unprecedented efforts to reach personally into the state’s electoral process as he seeks to prevent Michigan from formally declaring a winner there."
"The Washington Post changed the headline of its obituary of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday after facing backlash for calling him an “austere religious scholar.” Vice President of Communications at Washington Post Kristine Coratti Kelly said in a tweet that “the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.” The first version of the article described Baghdadi as the “Islamic State’s terrorist-in-chief,” before it was changed to “austere religious scholar.” It’s unclear why the newspaper initially changed the headline, but it was changed for..."
"The Washington Post is facing backlash after a headline characterized the Islamic State leader who was killed in a U.S. raid over the weekend as an ""austere religious scholar."" The headline was quickly changed, but critics say it sugar coated the terror inflicted by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
President Donald Trump announced Sunday morning that al-Baghdadi was killed when he detonated a vest he was wearing after being cornered by U.S. forces on Saturday evening."
"The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Friday temporarily allowed Texas’ near-total abortion ban — the strictest in the nation — to again be enforced after freezing a federal judge’s temporary block of the law. The state appealed the order just two days after it was issued.
A panel of 5th Circuit justices restored enforcement of the law hours after Texas asked the court to step into a lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against the state. Enforcement of the law will be allowed to continue until at least Tuesday, when a response from..."
"A federal appeals court Friday night quickly allowed Texas to resume banning most abortions, just one day after clinics began racing to serve patients again for the first time since early September.
A one-page order by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the nation’s strictest abortion law, which bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks. It makes no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.
“Patients are being thrown back into a state of chaos and fear,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive..."
"The United States Capitol Police Office of Professional Responsibility has cleared the officer involved in the shooting of Ashli Babbitt, U.S. Capitol Police announced in a press release on Monday, saying that officer ""will not be facing internal discipline.""
An internal investigation found the actions of the officer were ""lawful and within Department policy,"" it said."
"On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a telebriefing.
Director Rochelle Walensky presided, along with two career scientists. The substance was notable — updated COVID-19 guidance for K-12 schools.
But even more notable was the fact that the briefing was happening at all.
It was the first such briefing in months, despite the ongoing pandemic crisis.
That lack of regular communication has spurred criticism of the agency. In recent days, public health experts have called out CDC for confusing isolation and quarantine guidance, and asked the agency to communicate..."
"Two days before Christmas, with the Omicron variant driving a near-vertical rise in new coronavirus cases, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted the White House that she planned to recommend that people infected with the virus isolate for five days instead of 10.
The director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, had faced previous criticism for issuing recommendations that confused the public and in some cases caught the White House off guard. Determined to avoid that this time, she briefed other top Biden health officials on her..."
"The morning after Election Day in the 2022 midterms, control of the Senate remains a toss-up. As of Wednesday afternoon, Democrats had secured 48 seats and Republicans had 49 seats, with four races yet to be called, CBS News projects.
The Georgia race will go to a runoff in December between Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker, after neither cleared 50%. CBS News characterizes Nevada as a toss-up, and Arizona as leaning Democrat. 
Alaska, where three candidates are on the ballot in a ranked-choice voting system, had not yet been called early Wednesday, but CBS..."
"New Hampshire, which hasn’t executed anyone in 80 years and has only one inmate on death row, has became the latest US state to abolish the death penalty when the state senate voted to override the governor’s veto.
“Now it’s up to us to stop this practice that is archaic, costly, discriminatory and final,” said New Hampshire state senator Melanie Levesque.
The senate vote came a week after the 400-member house voted by the narrowest possible margin to override Republican governor Chris Sununu’s veto of a bill to repeal capital..."
"In the last days of his life, former Vice President Walter Mondale received a steady stream of phone calls of appreciation. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris all called to say goodbye and thank you.
It was a sign of respect for a man many Americans remember largely for his near-shutout defeat for the White House in 1984. But well after his bruising loss, Mondale remained a revered liberal elder — with a list of accomplishments that are still relevant today...."
"President Biden on Wednesday said migrants separated from family members at the border would not receive hundreds of thousands of dollars for the damage inflicted by the Trump-era policy, rejecting an option for monetary compensation that had been floated in negotiations with lawyers representing the families.
Representatives of the migrant families and government officials had discussed giving families $450,000 for each member affected by former President Donald J. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, which led to the separation of about 5,500 children from their parents, according to people familiar with the matter. But..."
"The 16-day partial government shutdown that just ended will be the last, if Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky has anything to say about it.
In a pair of newspaper interviews Thursday, McConnell used the same Kentucky metaphor that ""there's no education in the second kick of a mule."" The Republican Senate leader said the first kick was the 1995/1996 shutdowns and this one was the second. McConnell remained firm that there will not be a third.
""There will not be a government shutdown,"" McConnell told The Hill newspaper. To..."
"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said in an interview with ABC News on Thursday that he will continue to do whatever is necessary to stop the Affordable Care Act.
""I would do anything, and I will continue to do anything to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,"" Cruz said.
Pressed explicitly on whether he would rule out another shutdown, Cruz deflected and said he didn't want to game out future debates."
"The U.S. House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act on Wednesday night in a 220-212 vote, ushering in a series of police reform measures in the wake of national uprising against racial injustice and police brutality.
The policing reform bill aims to bolster police accountability and prevent problem officers from moving from one department to another by creating a national registry to track those with checkered records. It also would end certain police practices that have been under scrutiny after the deaths of Black Americans..."
"The House on Wednesday passed a police reform bill that would ban chokeholds and overhaul qualified immunity protections for officers.
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, H.R. 1280, passed 220-212 — although a Republican representative said he'd voted yes by mistake and changed the official record to reflect his opposition.
Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, tweeted that he'd pressed the wrong button and voted for the bill by accident."
"President Obama is considering airstrikes or airdrops of food and medicine to address a humanitarian crisis among as many as 40,000 members of religious minorities in Iraq, administration officials said on Thursday. The people have been dying of heat and thirst on a mountaintop, where they took shelter after death threats from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Sunni extremist group that has taken control of much of northern Iraq."
"Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukraine edged closer to central Kyiv as a series of strikes hit a residential neighborhood Tuesday, while the leaders of three European Union countries planned a bold visit to Ukraine’s capital and the number of people the war has driven from the country passed 3 million.
Large explosions thundered across Kyiv before dawn from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes, as Russia’s assault on the city appeared to become more systematic. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and caused dozens of..."
"The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are travelling to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv even as pre-dawn Russian shelling killed more civilians in an apartment building in Ukraine’s capital.
In statements from their respective capitals, the three leaders said they would be offering their support to Ukraine’s president as representatives of the other 24 EU heads of state and government.
The move by Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki, his Czech counterpart, Petr Fiala, and Slovenia’s Janez Janša was said to be an attempt to bolster Ukraine in its fight for..."
"While Sen. John McCain remains in Arizona recovering from Friday's craniotomy, surgery to remove a 5 cm blood clot from above his left eye, business will not go on as usual in Washington. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has to have every Republican senator voting to have a prayer of passing Trumpcare, has postponed the vote for the week or two (more likely two) that McCain's recovery will take."
"Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Sunday called for faster military development and announced no change in policies that have strained relations with Washington and tightened the ruling Communist Party’s control over society and the economy.
China’s most influential figure in decades spoke as the party opened a congress that was closely watched by companies, governments and the public for signs of official direction. It comes amid a painful slump in the world’s second-largest economy and tension with Washington and Asian neighbors over trade, technology and security.
Party plans call for..."
"A new New Yorker profile of Trump-Russia dossier author Christopher Steele reports on a lesser-known memo the former MI-6 spy allegedly discussed with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators. According to the report, in late November 2016, Steele relayed information from his Russian sources that senior Kremlin officials had intervened to block Mitt Romney as President-elect Trump’s choice for secretary of State. Reporter Jane Mayer writes that Moscow had asked Trump to appoint someone who would be willing to lift sanctions related to Ukraine and cooperate with Russia’s involvement in Syria...."
"President Joe Biden said he is “sick and tired” of lawmakers’ inaction on gun control after a gunman shot and killed over a dozen children at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday.
“As a nation, we have to ask: When in God’s name are we gonna stand up to the gun lobby … do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?” Biden said in an emotional speech from the White House.
“Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God’s..."
"The New York Times has created a spectacle around one of the stodgiest features of presidential primary season: The newspaper endorsement. In years past, the Times had simply splashed the name of the chosen one across its editorial page a week or so before the Iowa Caucuses, with a few bromides about “experience” and “temperament.” In the last two competitive Democratic primaries, the Times endorsed the establishment favorite Hillary Clinton, revealing both the Times’s own establishment leanings and the depths of its influence on actual voters.
This cycle, the Times..."
"Russia and the United States have carried out a dramatic prisoner exchange, trading a Marine veteran jailed by Moscow for a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving a long prison sentence in America, both countries announced Wednesday.
The surprise deal involving Trevor Reed, an American imprisoned for nearly three years, would have been a notable diplomatic maneuver even in times of peace, but it was all the more extraordinary because it was done as Russia’s war with Ukraine has driven relations with the U.S. to their lowest point in decades.
But while the prisoner..."
"American Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former Marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019, has been released in a prisoner swap.
The release ends a nearly three-year ordeal for Reed, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the ""life and health"" of Russian police officers in an altercation. Reed and his family have denied the charges against him.
Reed's release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.
""I'm going to try not to cry,..."
"Republicans are in a rage over President Biden’s speech in Philadelphia, in which he flatly declared that the American democratic experiment is in serious danger due to Donald Trump and the Republicans who remain allied with his political project.
So here’s a question for those Republicans: What exactly in Biden’s speech was wrong?
Many objections have been general: Republicans say his speech disparaged millions, that it was angry, or divisive, or political, or hateful, or depicted Republicans as the enemy."
"Here are all the House and Senate incumbents around the country who have lost their fights for reelection.
Alabama
Sen. Doug Jones (Democrat)
Arizona
Sen. Martha McSally (Republican)
Colorado
Sen. Cory Gardner (Republican)
Florida

Rep. Donna Shalala (Democrat)
Iowa
Rep. Abby Finkenauer (Democrat)"
"President Joe Biden last week slammed two Republican senators for proposing to end Social Security and Medicare as we know it. First, Biden renewed his attacks on Florida’s Rick Scott, who has called for all government programs, including Social Security and Medicare, to be reapproved every five years. The president then ripped Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson for recently proposing a vote each year to determine if Social Security and Medicare would be funded.
As Scott, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, writes in his “11-Point Plan to Rescue America,” “If..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin on Thursday dealt a devastating blow to Democrats' hopes for sweeping legislative action this year, telling Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his staff ""unequivocally"" that he won't support the climate or tax provisions of a Democratic economic package, two sources familiar with the talks tell CNN.
The two had been negotiating for months, and Schumer, a New York Democrat, had made a number of concessions to pare back the climate provisions to appease Manchin, whose support is critical in an evenly decided Senate.
Manchin is open to..."
"In a controversial move, the Commerce Department announced Monday that the question of citizenship will again be included in the 2020 Census.
The move comes at the request of the Justice Department, first made in the early days of the administration, saying it was needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act."
"With Tuesday's deadline for an international deal on Iran's nuclear program approaching, foreign ministers from Iran and six world powers are trying to hash out an agreement. The debate currently centers on where Iran's nuclear fuel should be stored, and how — and when — economic sanctions should be lifted."
"President Donald Trump lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Friday, a move designed to ease one area of tensions even as the President's wider trade agenda faces an uncertain future.
A joint statement from the US and Canadian governments said the tariffs -- which had been in place for a year -- would be removed within two days. The two sides agreed on monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to prevent steel dumping that might affect prices.
The announcement came a day after the Trump administration..."
"Americans had to reach deeper into their pockets in March, as yet another key inflation index showed prices hit a fresh 40-year high.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index increased by 6.6% for the year ended in March, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the highest rate since the period ended January 1982, outpacing the figure from February.
Energy costs soared in the first quarter on the back of the war in Ukraine, rising 33.9% for the year ended in March. Food prices rose 9.2% over the same period.
Stripping out food and energy costs,..."
"When a second busload of migrants arrived in New York City from the Texas border on Sunday, Mayor Eric Adams was there to greet them — and again slam Gov. Greg Abbott for the move.
“This is horrific, when you think about what the governor is doing,” Adams said at the Port Authority bus terminal, where 14 migrants were dropped off early Sunday morning, Politico reported.
Officials had expected 40 people to be on the bus, but Adams said some migrants appear to have gotten off at other stops along the route. Adams..."
"Rapper, artist and fashion designer Kanye West ― who changed his name to Ye last year ― used the first part of an eventful interview with Tucker Carlson on Thursday to slam his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, the Kushner brothers, Lizzo and others.
West, who sat down with the “Fox News” host days after he displayed a “White Lives Matter” shirt during a Paris show for his Yeezy fashion line, claimed the fashion industry has influenced Kardashian to “put her ass out” despite being a Christian woman.
West reflected on his..."
"The woman’s email arrived in Anthony Fauci’s inbox on Feb. 28, 2020, with a one-word subject line: “URGENT.”
The coronavirus crisis was still in its early stages, and Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease scientist, was already under tremendous pressure, both because of the health threat facing the country and the political climate fostered by the Trump administration.
“I understand Vice President Pence has ordered you to not inform the public about Coronavirus without approval. This is quite terrifying, especially since Trump has already shown his desire to spread..."
"Mitt Romney found himself on the defensive yet again on his overseas trip, this time after offending Palestinian leaders with comments he made at a breakfast fund-raiser here on Monday.
Speaking to roughly four dozen donors at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, Mr. Romney suggested that cultural differences between the Israelis and the Palestinians were the reason the Israelis were so much more economically successful than the Palestinians, without mentioning the impact that deep trade restrictions imposed by the Israeli government have had on the Palestinian economy. He also..."
"Reports that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said at a fundraiser in Jerusalem that ""culture"" is among the reasons Israel's economy is much stronger than those in ""areas managed by the Palestinian Authority"" have led a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to accuse Romney of racism.
""It is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,"" Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud"
"Mitt Romney told Jewish donors Monday that their culture is part of what has allowed them to be more economically successful than the Palestinians, outraging Palestinian leaders who suggested his comments were racist and out of touch with the realities of the Middle East. Romney's campaign later said his remarks were mischaracterized.
""As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about $21,000, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is..."
"A federal judge in Florida has ruled that the CDC's mask mandate in airports, transit hubs, and public transportation is unlawful and has ordered that it be struck down.
US District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle for the Middle District of Florida wrote in a summary judgment that the CDC had exceeded its legal powers by issuing the mandate in January 2021 to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
""The Court concludes that the Mask Mandate exceeds the CDC's statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the..."
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Democrats in the House to use their leverage and reject a bipartisan spending bill to keep the government open until a measure tucked inside rolling back a piece of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law is removed.
“Who does Congress work for?” Warren said in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon. “Does it work for the millionaires, the billionaires, the giant companies with their armies of lobbyists and lawyers, or does it work for all the people?”

"The $1.1 trillion spending agreement reached by House and Senate negotiators on Tuesday night would vastly expand the amount of money that donors can give political parties, bolstering party leaders’ ability to tap into the wallets of their largest contributors and reclaiming some clout from the outside groups that can accept unlimited dollars.
Depending on how the new law is interpreted by election officials, the provision could expand the amount that any one person can give to national party committees to more than $777,000 each year from what is now..."
"I know what the numbers say. I can read the returns. By those hard, cold, simplistic measures, Liz Cheney was defeated overwhelmingly in her House Republican primary in Wyoming on Tuesday night, and her time in Congress is winding down.
But it’s impossible for me to say that she lost.
She got many, many fewer votes than her opponent, an unscrupulous shape shifter unfit to shine her shoes, because she chose the tough world of truth over Donald Trump’s underworld of lies. That’s a moral victory.
She was spurned by conservatives in Wyoming because..."
"Former President Donald Trump is facing what could be his biggest electoral defeat since 2020 as he attempts to settle old scores against fellow Republicans in Georgia.
In the marquee race of the day, which includes primaries in Alabama and runoffs in Texas, Trump-backed David Perdue is sputtering in his bid to unseat Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom the former president is determined to oust for not joining his effort to overturn the state's presidential election results two years ago.
Polls leading up to Election Day indicate Kemp had a wide lead over Perdue, a former..."
"The Justice Department said on Wednesday that a group of hackers associated with China’s main intelligence service had infiltrated more than 100 companies and organizations around the world to steal intelligence, hijack their networks and extort their victims.
The United States government presented the allegations in a set of three indictments unsealed on Wednesday that showed the scope and sophistication of China’s attempts to unlawfully advance its economy and to become the dominant global superpower through cyberattacks. The indictments also said some of the hackers had worked with Malaysian nationals..."
In the early morning hours Saturday after almost 13 continuous hours of voting the Senate passed a budget resolution for the first time in nearly four years. The proposal which Democratic drafters say will reduce the deficit by 1.85 trillion between spending cuts and tax increases passed narrowly 50-49 on a largely partisan vote at 456 a.m. A...
"Hundreds of climate change protesters swarmed the field during halftime of the annual Harvard-Yale football game Saturday, delaying the action for nearly an hour as students chanted “OK boomer” and as police made arrests and issued summonses for disorderly conduct.
Players from both teams joined demonstrators on the field in a showstopping escalation of long-running campaigns for the two schools to stop investing their endowments in fossil fuels and forgive Puerto Rican debt. Protesters sat at the 50-yard line at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Conn., arms linked and..."
"The annual Harvard-Yale football game was delayed for almost an hour on Saturday as climate change activists rushed the field at the end of halftime.
Unfurling banners with slogans like ""Nobody wins. Yale and Harvard are complicit in climate injustice,"" protesters from both schools called on the universities to divest their multi-million dollar endowments from fossil fuels companies, as well as companies that hold Puerto Rican debt.
Clad in winter coats and hats, about 150 students sprawled around the 50-yard line at Yale Bowl as loudspeaker announcements and police demanded..."
"In a sign that the coronavirus pandemic is beginning to ebb in America, a new analysis finds the seven-day average of new COVID-19 deaths in the United States has hit its lowest point since last October.
As of Wednesday, 684 new deaths had been reported, data from Johns Hopkins University showed. That's roughly an 80% drop since January, CNN reported. And the decline has been sure and steady in recent months: Since the start of 2021, the seven-day average number of COVID-19 deaths has decreased.
What is fueling the promising..."
"The Federal Reserve ordered another super-sized jump in interest rates today, and signaled that additional rate hikes are likely in the coming months, as it tries to put the brakes on runaway prices.
The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points Wednesday, matching hikes in June and July. The Fed has been boosting borrowing costs at the fastest pace in decades. But so far, its actions have done little to curb the rapid run-up in prices.
The annual inflation rate in August was 8.3% — down only slightly..."
"Americans are going back to work.
Powered by a burst of hiring in recent months and an uptick in wages, the huge army of workers that had been on the sidelines of the recovery is slowly returning to the job market.
The Labor Department said on Friday the proportion of Americans in the labor force crept up slightly to 63 percent — the highest level in two years. Although still well below where it should be, that represents a move in the right direction and extends a trend that began..."
"President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden zeroed in on the critical battleground of Pennsylvania on Monday, demonstrating starkly different approaches to rallying voters just eight days before polls close during the worst public health crisis in a century.
Trump drew thousands of largely mask-less supporters as he began a final-week charge through nearly a dozen states ahead of the election. Biden, taking a more cautious approach in effort to show that he’s taking the pandemic seriously, greeted a few dozen supporters outside a Chester, Pennsylvania, campaign field office...."
"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is testifying Wednesday about his findings that the FBI investigation of President Trump’s 2016 campaign featured “serious performance failures” but was not motivated by political bias.
The inspector general’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes amid a tense standoff among senior government officials over the 434-page report analyzing the FBI investigation in 2016 to determine if anyone in the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia to interfere in the presidential election.
“We did not find any documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias..."
"Editors of the National Review on Thursday night published their ""Against Trump Symposium,"" a collection of essays in which conservative luminaries teamed up to decry the prospect of Donald Trump becoming the GOP's presidential nominee and, by extension, the party's standard-bearer of conservatism. There were immediate consequences: The magazine was ""disinvited"" from participating in an upcoming debate.
National Review publisher Jack Fowler posted the news to The Corner. As he relates, the magazine was a media partner to the Feb. 25, pre-Super Tuesday debate -- already noteworthy for having been..."
"When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign, he was a highly respected real-estate mogul known for his incredible business instincts and impeccable taste (or at least, that’s the character he played on TV). He could have spent his days enjoying the good life — golfing at a different Trump resort every weekend, eating fast food in bed, and tweeting about things he saw on Fox News — but instead, he generously decided to share his talents with the American people. “My whole life, I have been greedy, greedy, greedy,” Trump..."
"The U.K.’s new Treasury chief ripped up the government’s economic plan on Monday, dramatically reversing most of the tax cuts and spending plans that new Prime Minister Liz Truss announced less than a month ago. The move raises more questions about how long the beleaguered British leader can stay in office, though Truss insisted she has no plans to quit.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt, said he was scrapping “almost all” of Truss’ tax cuts, along with her flagship energy policy and her promise — repeated just last week — that there will be no public..."
"With tens of million of drivers expected to hit the road this Memorial Day weekend, none of them will be thrilled to see that the price of gas is at its highest price in nearly a decade.
According to AAA, gas prices are up 58% from a year ago with an average gallon costing drivers $3.04.
Gas prices in the United States soared earlier this month after the Colonial Pipeline, the East Coast’s primary gasoline supply line fell victim to a ransomware attack that took its operations offline for six..."
"Covid’s starkly different impact on the young and old has been one of the virus’s defining characteristics. It tends to be mild for children and younger adults but is often severe for the elderly. More than three-quarters of all U.S. Covid deaths have occurred among people 65 and older.
Given these patterns, it seems obvious that older Americans should be more fearful of Covid than younger Americans. Yet they’re not.
That’s one of the striking findings from a new poll that Morning Consult, a survey firm, has conducted for this..."
"Several top backers — including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani — are trying to persuade Trump to move past his feud with the parents of the late Iraq War soldier Humayun Khan, stop bashing fellow Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, and refocus his attacks on Hillary Clinton."
"President Barack Obama admitted Thursday to the American people that he “fumbled the ball” in implementing the heart of the Affordable Care Act, but his immediate concern is convincing congressional Democrats to give him another chance to prove he can cross the goal line.
The new play: Offer a fix to reverse the cancellation of millions of Americans’ existing health insurance, blame insurers for the situation, put Republicans on the defensive, and — if he’s lucky — unify Democrats around a new policy that might just give them political..."
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and a group of other Senate Democrats introduced draft legislation on Wednesday that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level by striking it from the federal controlled substances list.
It's significant for a Senate majority leader to back such a measure and the move highlights the evolving politics of cannabis policy. At a news conference, Schumer vowed to ""use my clout as majority leader to make this a priority in the Senate."" At the same time, the proposal remains a draft bill at this point and marks..."
"Republican presidential hopefuls are turning out this weekend for two big events, but just one of them, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, plans to be at both.
Cruz is among seven possible contenders who spoke Saturday at the Iowa Freedom Summit, cosponsored by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and the group Citizens United. Sunday night, Cruz is scheduled to join two possible primary rivals, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., at a semi-annual conference of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce.
Freedom Partners is a central part of the powerful..."
"A crowded field of potential Republican presidential candidates scrapped for the hearts of the party’s conservative base here Saturday, implicitly rejecting the more moderate wing favored by big donors and trying to fire up the kind of grass-roots supporters who will play a critical role in the nominating process.
The daylong forum, billed as an informal kickoff to the 2016 campaign, was attended by about 1,200 people, many of whom ardently oppose the centrist views that tend to prevail in a general election.
The speakers, some of them experienced presidential..."
"Election Day is Tuesday, but with early voting, the more accepted use of mail voting and the prospect of razor-thin races, it's really Election Season.
And Tuesday only marks the beginning of the next phase in that season.
Gird for many of these elections to go on for days, if not weeks. This is all perfectly normal when there are close elections. It doesn't mean that there is fraud — despite the lies about his 2020 loss that former President Donald Trump has pushed and so many candidates he's backed..."
"Chris Christie kicked off a two day swing to New Hampshire with a sober prescription for tackling escalating entitlement spending.
The New Jersey governor and potential Republican presidential candidate proposed raising the retirement age for Social security to 69, means testing for Social Security, and gradually raising the eligibility age for Medicare.
Christie outlined his proposals on entitlement reform at a speech Tuesday morning at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College."
The Obama Administration continued its push to reduce the number of prisoners serving long sentences as a result of the nation’s federal drug laws on Monday with an announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder describing new rules that would expand the pool of convicts eligible to apply for presidential clemency.
"Speaking to reporters Friday morning, President Trump offered assurances that former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, newly added to his legal team, would soon answer outstanding questions about the October 2016 payment of $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels. Giuliani had joined the team only “yesterday,” Trump said, and the former mayor would soon “get his facts straight,” implying that Giuliani’s facts, broadcast in various television and print interviews, had missed the mark. Trump promised a clarifying statement from Giuliani, perhaps explaining the vagueness of the timeline that had been..."
"Two business associates of President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani were arrested and are in custody Thursday, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan said.
The two men, who helped Giuliani investigate former vice president Joe Biden, were arrested Wednesday night in Virginia and charged with campaign finance violations, according to a person familiar with the charges. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman have been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan and..."
"Two Ukrainian-born business partners, who showered Republican campaign committees with nearly $500,000 and dined with President Donald Trump at the White House, were arrested late Wednesday on campaign finances charges, federal authorities said Thursday.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman helped Rudy Giuliani meet a key Ukrainian prosecutor as the president's personal lawyer sought to discredit Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Both of the men also are among the prospective witnesses House Democrats want to question in their impeachment inquiry.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal allies stepped up their defense of the freshman Democrat.
A vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism in response to controversial comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar is set to slip past Wednesday amid intensifying pressure from the left both inside and outside the House Democratic Caucus.
An array of progressive groups declared their support for Omar, while both the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus — two of the most important factions among House Democrats — wanted more time to review the situation, lawmakers and..."
"It is something only a blinkered sociopath or a billionaire hedge fund manager would say out loud. The financial titan in question, Chamath Palihapitiya, said with a shrug to fellow co-hosts of his podcast All-In, ""Nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs, OK? You bring it up because you really care, and I think it's nice that you care, the rest of us don't care. ... I'm just telling you ... a very hard, ugly truth. Of all the things I care about, yes, it is below my line.""

"The U.S. Postal Service is well prepared and has ample capacity to deliver America’s election mail for the upcoming general election in November.
On any given day, the Postal Service delivers more than 425 million pieces of mail, and our best estimates are that election mail will account for less than 2% of all mail volume from mid-September until Election Day. Given our available processing capacity, we can easily handle the anticipated increase in election mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic, without impact to on-time performance.
In recent weeks, the..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and 174 other Democrats in the chamber signed a letter sent Wednesday to the new Postmaster General demanding the agency reverses operational changes they argue would hamper mail-in voting on Nov. 3.
""It is always essential that the Postal Service be able to deliver mail in a timely and effective manner. During the once-in-a-century health and economic crisis of COVID-19, the Postal Service's smooth functioning is a matter of life-or-death, and is critical for protecting lives, livelihoods and the life of our American Democracy,"" the..."
"The Justice Department has charged 11 defendants with seditious conspiracy related to the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, including the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes.
The new indictment, handed down by a grand jury on Wednesday and made public Thursday, alleges that Rhodes and his co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to ""oppose the lawful transfer of presidential power by force, by preventing, hindering, or delaying by force execution of laws governing the transfer of power.""
The latest court filings revealed that Oath Keeper Thomas Caldwell, who was arrested..."
"Facebook has failed on civil rights.
On Wednesday, after two years of work, the social media giant finally released the results of its independent audit, a wide-ranging report on the state of civil rights on Facebook, from hate speech to advertising to algorithmic bias. The auditors found that the company simply hasn’t done enough to combat hate and abuse on its platform.
Following up on two previous updates in December 2018 and June 2019, the audit concludes that the company’s handling of civil rights issues is “too reactive and piecemeal,”..."
"In a dramatic sign that Europe’s fast-mounting refugee crisis may be set to get even worse, Hungary’s far-right leader told asylum-seekers Thursday to stay away from Europe and vowed to crack down on the thousands of migrants who are crossing into his country every day.
The harsh comments following emergency meetings with European Union leaders in Brussels came as thousands of asylum-seekers rushed Budapest’s central train station, desperate to move onward from squalid conditions but frightened that Hungarian authorities were laying a trap.
Hungary’s leaders have taken the hardest stance..."
"Hungary's prime minister says his country is doing all it can to manage a growing migrant crisis that has flooded it with refugees, as European officials said they will meet later this month in Brussels to discuss an effort to ""strengthen the European response"" to the situation.
Viktor Orban said the influx of refugees into his country is really ""a German problem"" because that is the intended destination of most of them. Hungarians, along with other Europeans are ""full of fear"" he says, because ""they see that the European leaders,..."
"New Jersey has joined 14 other states in passing a law allowing unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses — meaning that nearly half of the estimated 10.6 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the US now live in states with such laws.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is expected to sign the bill passed by the New Jersey Legislature on Monday night. The legislation would create two forms of driver’s licenses: a federally compliant Real ID license that let people board planes, and a “standard” driver’s license for driving and identification,..."
"ALBANY, N.Y. – Federal immigration and border officials have been blocked from New York's DMV database, a move that keeps them from accessing data that can be used to help determine whether a vehicle owner has a criminal history or a warrant for their arrest.
New York's Green Light Law took effect Saturday, allowing those without legal immigration status to apply for driver's licenses in New York.
But the law also included a provision prohibiting state DMV officials from providing any of its data to entities that enforce immigration law..."
"It’s like the first line of a bad joke: “Six Tempe police officers go into a Starbucks …”
And the punchline is even worse.
An unwise decision by a single barista in a single coffee shop on a single day winds up as a triple, venti, double-shot, non-fat, caramel macchiato campaign for a national boycott.
It’s time to dump the #DumpStarbucks hashtag, which never should have existed in the first place."
"Federal agents investigating President Biden’s son Hunter have gathered what they believe is sufficient evidence to charge him with tax crimes and a false statement related to a gun purchase, according to people familiar with the case. The next step is for the U.S. Attorney in Delaware, a Trump administration holdover, to decide on whether to file such charges, these people said.
The investigation into Hunter Biden began in 2018, and became a central focus for then-president Donald Trump during his unsuccessful 2020 reelection effort. Initially, the investigation centered around Hunter Biden’s finances..."
"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Ukraine expert at the National Security Council who became a star witness in the House impeachment hearings on President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, was escorted out of the White House on Friday, his lawyer said, adding Trump had ""decided to exact revenge.""
""There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House. LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth,"" David Pressman of..."
"“Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth,” Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified in November, during the House’s impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against Ukraine.
But now that the Senate has delivered the president “total acquittal” on two articles of impeachment, a triumphant Trump is apparently seeking vengeance. And Vindman appears to be his first target.
Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, listened in on Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He testified that he found the..."
"Have you heard the one about the Mormon and the Muslim?
Politics makes strange bedfellows, but there may no odder couple in recent American political history than Orrin Hatch — the white, rock-ribbed conservative Utah Republican and Mormon — and Muhammad Ali, the most famous boxer ever, African-American icon and Muslim convert.
Yet the two had a friendship that lasted decades, up until Ali's death last week at age 74. Ali's wife, Lonnie, asked Hatch to speak at her husband's funeral Friday in Louisville, Ky., Ali's hometown.
Hatch said he..."
"Among the dignitaries who will speak on Friday at Muhammad Ali’s memorial service in Louisville, Ky., such as former President Bill Clinton and the comedian Billy Crystal, is one Washington figure who might be something of a surprise: Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.
Mr. Ali, the former heavyweight champion, showed up in Mr. Hatch’s office in the Senate one day in 1988, apparently impressed by Mr. Hatch’s performance at some high-profile hearings. A deep friendship was born.
Mr. Ali campaigned in Utah for Mr. Hatch’s re-election in 1988..."
"The global economy may be headed for years of weak growth and rising prices, a toxic combination that will test the stability of dozens of countries still struggling to rebound from the pandemic, the World Bank warned Tuesday.
Not since the 1970s — when twin oil shocks sapped growth and lifted prices, giving rise to the malady known as “stagflation” — has the global economy faced such a challenge.
The bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent from January’s 4.1 percent and said that “subdued growth will..."
"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has announced he will suspend the controversial changes he instituted to the U.S. Postal Service until after the November election.
""To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,"" DeJoy said in a statement.
He said that between now and Election Day, retail hours at post offices will not change, no mail processing facilities will be closed, mail processing equipment and collection boxes will remain in place, and overtime for workers will be..."
"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Tuesday agreed to testify on Friday before Senate lawmakers, setting up President Donald Trump's controversial pick for two blockbuster hearings within a few days amid a political firestorm over mail-in voting and claims that President Donald Trump is trying to ""sabotage"" the November election.
After Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., announced the Friday hearing, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer credited ""immense pressure from Senate Democrats and the American people"" with having ""forced Senate Republicans to confront Postmaster General DeJoy's..."
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has played down talk of impeachment for months, ratcheted up her objections to trying to remove President Trump from office in an interview published on Monday.
“I’m not for impeachment,” Ms. Pelosi told The Washington Post Magazine in the interview, which was conducted last week.
“Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” she added. “And he’s just not worth it.”..."
"A host of Republicans is calling for the head of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius over the troubled health care website rollout. Thirty-three Republican members of Congress signed Rep. John Fleming's letter to President Barack Obama demanding that Sebelius be fired. But whether to sack her is not one of the questions we should be asking.
The secretary spent 3 ½ hours testifying before a congressional committee on Wednesday about the awful mess that was the launch of the federal website intended to allow millions of Americans..."
"During a Friday Obamacare education and outreach session in Tennessee, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius faced an unexpected encounter.
The Memphis Daily News captured a photo of Sebelius holding a copy of ""Web Sites for Dummies"" at a local library. The individual behind the exchange was state Sen. Brian Kelsey (R), who claimed on Twitter that the ""book is simply a reminder"" that ""Tennessee does NOT want Medicaid expansion."""
"Climate change is on course to transform life on Earth as we know it, and unless global warming is dramatically slowed, billions of people and other species will reach points where they can no longer adapt to the new normal, according to a major report published Monday.
The UN-backed report, based on years of research from hundreds of scientists, found that the impacts from human-caused climate change were larger than previously thought. The report's authors say these impacts are happening much faster and are more disruptive and widespread than scientists expected 20 years ago...."
"Deadly with extreme weather now, climate change is about to get so much worse. It is likely going to make the world sicker, hungrier, poorer, gloomier and way more dangerous in the next 18 years with an “unavoidable” increase in risks, a new United Nations science report says.
And after that watch out.
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report said Monday if human-caused global warming isn’t limited to just another couple tenths of a degree, an Earth now struck regularly by deadly heat, fires, floods and drought in..."
"WASHINGTON — Last month, two dozen diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, warned about the possibility of a Taliban takeover and urged the State Department to begin an airlift operation in a dissent cable sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to a source familiar with the situation.
The July 13 cable called on Washington to be firm and direct in describing atrocities by the Taliban, the source said. NBC News has not seen the cable.
A dissent channel cable is a confidential, formal way for State Department diplomats..."
"The United States is struggling to pick up the pace of American and Afghan evacuations at Kabul airport, constrained by obstacles ranging from armed Taliban checkpoints to paperwork problems. With an Aug. 31 deadline looming, tens of thousands remained to be airlifted from the chaotic country.
Taliban fighters and their checkpoints ringed the airport — major barriers for Afghans who fear that their past work with Westerners makes them prime targets for retribution. Hundreds of Afghans who lacked any papers or clearance for evacuation also congregated outside the airport, adding to..."
"Recent reports suggest that the Department of Justice is ramping up its investigation of former President Donald Trump’s criminal liability for the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. The FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents has opened up a different legal front against the former president, but it is important not to lose sight of this summer’s earlier revelations that increase the chance that Trump will be prosecuted for his efforts to overturn the election and for the violence at the Capitol.
Some commentators have questioned the wisdom..."
"A call between US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday ""did not go well,"" a senior Ukrainian official told CNN, amid disagreements over the ""risk levels"" of a Russian attack.
The White House, however, disputed the official's account, warning that anonymous sources were ""leaking falsehoods."" They did state that Biden warned Zelensky an imminent invasion is a ""distinct possibility.""
On the call, which the Ukrainian official described as ""long and frank,"" Biden warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a Russian attack may be imminent, saying that an invasion was now..."
"The Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its emergency rule mandating that workers at large businesses get vaccinated or undergo regular testing for COVID-19, a major setback for the president’s national vaccination effort.
However, the court decided to allow the administration to proceed with a vaccine mandate for health care workers at federally funded facilities.
The justices’ decision to intervene and halt one of the vaccine regulations has major public health implications amid a surge in coronavirus cases due to the omicron variant. The White House hoped the rule, issued through the..."
"Muslims experienced very different treatment in America 15 years ago.
“There was a sense of intrigue; it was something different,” said Adam Soltani, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Oklahoma chapter, of how others viewed Islam. “But I didn’t sense any fear in being Muslim at all.”"
"House and Senate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, highlighting their intention to include the measure in the next round of Covid-19 relief.
The Raise the Wage Act of 2021 follows through on one of President Joe Biden’s priorities for the aid package, and mirrors a bill that passed in the House in 2019. It would phase in the hike from the current $7.25 to $9.50 this year and the full $15 by 2025."
"President Barack Obama on Sunday gave voice to the conundrum at the heart of his Syria policy, acknowledging that the U.S.-led military campaign against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria is helping Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, a man the United Nations has accused of war crimes."
"Sports were never a durable shelter from the world for anyone who wasn’t privileged enough, or naïve enough, to turn them into one. Every game fits into the world it inhabits, for good or ill. The Olympics are even more enmeshed in the rest of the world than other sporting events, as evidenced by the massive political operations that go into landing them for host countries in the first place, the flags that fly all over them, and the nationalistic scenes they create. Maybe the most remembered Winter Olympic moment..."
"Early Friday evening Sen. Elizabeth Warren took to the Senate floor and gave a plain-spoken, barn-burning speech that could make history and put her into serious contention to be the next President of the United States.
There are only a handful of political speeches that have such historic impact. Barack Obama's keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention comes readily to mind. It's what catapulted an obscure Illinois state Senator into the national limelight and put him on the path to becoming President.
Warren's Senate speech was different, but just..."
"She's said it once, and she'll say it four times: Sen. Elizabeth Warren is not running for president.
Asked four times by NPR's Steve Inskeep on Monday morning whether she was running for president, Warren held her ground, repeating each time: ""I am not running for president.""
""That's not what we're doing. We had a really important fight in the United States Congress just this past week, and I'm putting all my energy into that fight, into what happens after this,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said.
Inskeep pointed..."
"What on earth was the point of Sarah Sanders?
For 94 days, the outgoing White House press secretary gave no press briefing in the press room just a few steps from the press office that she nominally ran.
But the press did not stop pressing.
For more than three years, Sanders made no meaningful news on behalf of a boss who considers it his presidential priority to make as much meaningless news as possible.
Yet the news did not stop breaking."
"A New York City federal judge said Monday he would dismiss Sarah Palin's claim that she was defamed by The New York Times when it incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former Rep. Gabby Giffords.
Palin, who was the governor of Alaska when she rocketed to fame in 2008 after Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the GOP presidential nominee, picked her as his running mate, claimed her reputation had been damaged by the Times editorial.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan disagreed and..."

House GOP launches shutdown battle
Congress: will it be a government shutdown or budget compromise?
House Speaker John Boehner and other top leaders outlined a lengthy GOP wish list of items they plan to attach to legislation raising the nation's debt limit, including a delay of..."
"House Republicans rallied behind their right wing Friday to launch a full-scale assault on President Obama’s health-care initiative, setting up a protracted confrontation with Democrats that risks shutting down the government in just 10 days.
On a vote of 230 to 189, the House approved and sent to the Senate a plan to fund federal agencies past Sept. 30, but also to strip funding from the Affordable Care Act, the president’s most significant legislative achievement."
"CBC confirmed Thursday it deleted a scene featuring Donald Trump from the movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, but the broadcaster says the cut occurred before he became president and was not politically motivated.
Several media outlets reported Trump's cameo in the 1992 movie was edited out of the CBC TV broadcast of the movie earlier this month.
In the uncut version, Trump appears for some seven seconds in a scene set at the Plaza Hotel in New York, when Macauley Culkin's character Kevin McCallister asks him for..."
"Fox News host Katie Pavlich on Friday walked back her assertion that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s cut of Donald Trump’s Home Alone 2 cameo was “censorship,” noting that the edit took place years before Trump actually became president.
During Thursday’s broadcast of Fox & Friends, Pavlich took issue with the CBC axing Trump’s seven-second scene from their airings. After fellow co-host Ed Henry called it “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Pavlich groused that it was “also censorship.”"
"Happy Fourth of July, everybody. I want you to have a great day. No moaning about the state of the nation.
Don’t obsess about Donald Trump! It’s true he thought watching a bunch of tanks roll through Washington, D.C., would be a great way of celebrating our national character. Fortunately, it turned out the city streets couldn’t support his vision. The military came up with a compromise, dragging in tanks and other tanklike vehicles on flatbed trucks, in a very expensive show totally unrelated to their actual function.
Some people..."
"Mitt Romney began his stump speech in Michigan on Friday with a joke which raised a sensitive issue: birth certificates.
""I love being home in this place where Ann and I were raised, where both of us were born,"" he said. ""Ann was born at Henry Ford hospital, I was born at Harper hospital. No one has ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised."""
"Mitt Romney made a joke about his birth certificate at a rally in Commerce, Mich. on Friday.
Speaking about his Michigan roots, he said, ""No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised.""
The joke was received with hearty applause by the audience. Still, it was an awkward moment for the candidate to play on the birther conspiracies that have plagued Barack Obama since he ran for president in 2008, even after the president released his ""long-form""..."
"A bipartisan group of 10 U.S. senators says they agree on a ""framework"" for a deal on an infrastructure package, but the members did not release any details and top leaders from both parties have been mostly silent on the development.
According to two sources familiar with the negotiations, the agreement is focused on ""core, physical infrastructure."" The proposal would cost $1.2 trillion over eight years and include $579 billion in new spending.
The plan would not have any tax hikes, and aides did not provide any further details on..."
"A bipartisan group of senators announced on Thursday that they had reached an agreement on a framework to invest in the nation’s aging public works system, racing to prove that a compromise was feasible despite deep divisions over how to structure and finance an infrastructure package.
The announcement came after a dizzying day on Capitol Hill, where senators involved in the bipartisan discussions offered conflicting assessments of their progress and declined to comment on specific proposals. But by early evening, five Democrats and five Republicans issued a joint statement announcing..."
"Puerto Rico has now endured the longest power failure in U.S. history, after Category 4 Hurricane Maria tore a path of destruction across the island on Sept. 20. One of the contracts the island's beleaguered government signed in order to get the lights turned back on is with a tiny Montana-based company named Whitefish Energy."
"Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown on August 9, has resigned, effective immediately, from the Ferguson Police Department, the Associated Press reported.
A grand jury on November 24 decided not to indict Wilson for killing Brown, a black 18-year-old who was unarmed at the time of the shooting.
Wilson's resignation was reported even before the grand jury decision."
"A few hundred people protested overnight in Ferguson, Mo., but there were initial reports of few arrests by police hours after officer Darren Wilson's resignation was made public.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch says that ""outside the Ferguson police department, about 150 to 200 protesters gathered to chant and wave signs and flags. At about 8:45 p.m., they marched South on South Florissant Road."" The newspaper says one arrest was made after a man threw a bottle at police.
St. Louis Public Radio live blogged the evening's marches and protests..."
"(CNN)US President Donald Trump says he ordered the assassination on Friday of Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani, ""to stop a war."" But that's simply not true.
Rather than stop a war, Trump just called Tehran's bluff and wagered all in with the single most daring American act in a conflict that's been raging for years.
No American president has ever taken the fight to Tehran like this. It's bold. It's provocative.
And it could set the Middle East aflame -- but it is most definitely not stopping a war...."

"Greg Gianforte’s 7 percentage point win in the Montana special election keeps a seat in Republican hands, but fundamentally represents bad news for the GOP. The basic issue, as David Wasserman breaks down for the Cook Political Report, is that for prognostication purposes you don’t just want to know who wins or loses a special election — you want to know the margin."
"Federal and state officials unveiled a sweeping response Thursday to violent clashes between police and protesters over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, with Missouri taking over security operations from local police and authorities agreeing to accept Justice Department help in handling protests."
"Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been convicted of four counts of fraud, but she was acquitted of four other charges. The jury said earlier they were deadlocked on the three remaining charges.

A judge will determine her sentence at a later date. Holmes could now face up to 20 years in prison for each count.
Earlier Monday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila called the jury back to the courtroom where the lengthy..."
"Lawyers for former President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to step into the legal fight over the classified documents seized during an FBI search of his Florida estate, escalating a dispute over the powers of an independent arbiter appointed to inspect the records.
The Trump team asked the justices to overturn a lower court ruling and allow the arbiter, called a special master, to review the roughly 100 documents with classification markings that were taken in the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago.
A three-judge panel from..."
"The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in a 5-1-3 decision in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on Friday. Abortion will now be heavily restricted or completely banned in about half of the U.S.’s 50 states.
But changes to legal access to abortion, while radical and widespread, will happen unevenly under a patchwork of varying state laws. Overturning Roe just means states are free to decide how to, or if, to allow access to abortion services. Sixteen states will immediately, or in short order, ban abortions in..."
"Arizona senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain died Saturday at the age of 81. McCain leaves behind his wife of 37 years, Cindy; seven children, including three from his first marriage, to Carol Shepp; and his 106-year-old mother, Roberta McCain. Perhaps America's most famous prisoner of war, the former Navy pilot with a famous admiral father was shot down over Vietnam and spent 5 1/2 years as a POW in the north, most of that time in a prison sarcastically termed the Hanoi Hilton for the way inmates were treated."
"As condolences poured in for Sen. John McCain from his political allies and foes alike, the Arizona Republican's daughter, Meghan McCain, offered a personal a heartfelt tribute to a father who ""taught me how to live.""
""I was with my father at his end, as he was with me at my beginning,"" Meghan McCain wrote in a statement. ""In the thirty-three years we shared together, he raised me, taught me, corrected me, comforted me, encouraged me, and supported me in all things. He loved me, and I loved him."
"Minutes after horrible economic numbers — a 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims — were released, President Trump tweeted out a statement suggesting we should delay the election. Clearly, he wants us to ignore the 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross national product and 1.43 million new jobless claims. But we won’t ignore the 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims.
Do not get me wrong. Trump’s suggestion is anti-democratic and emblematic of his inability..."

"About 40 large fires are ravaging the three contiguous West Coast states, and Oregon's governor says some situations have been dire enough to make even firefighters retreat.
Hundreds of thousands of acres are burning and thousands of people have been evacuated in parts of California, Oregon and Washington after extreme heat and high winds combined to let fires tear through territories uncontrolled.
In Oregon, thousands of residents evacuated their homes to escape the flames that have already scorched more than 230,000 acres, Gov. Kate Brown said Tuesday evening.

"Mitt Romney told British leaders he hopes to take in an Olympics swimming competition during his time in London. With no pool in sight, the Republican presidential candidate has already made waves of his own.
Early Thursday morning in the U.K., while much of the U.S. political world was fast asleep, the British press had seized on comments the GOP contender made about London's preparations for the Olympics."
"Attorney General William Barr is facing fresh criticism over a series of appearances and provocative public remarks that appear to dovetail with key themes of President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.
Barr has maintained an unusually high public profile as the presidential campaign gets into full swing, sometimes sounding more like a cable news pundit as he blames Democrats for violent civil unrest and offers dire warnings about the potential consequences if Trump loses in November."
"President Trump said Monday that better mental health — not gun control — is the key to the mass shooting that claimed at least 26 lives at a Texas church.
""I think mental health is the problem here,"" Trump said during a news conference in Tokyo, saying the shooter in Texas was a ""deranged"" man who should have received treatment. ""This isn't a guns situation.""
Trump, who received heavy political support from the National Rifle Association and other gun owners, has been an opponent of gun control proposals that have..."
"Former President Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden called for action to prevent gun violence in the hours after the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sunday that left 26 people dead and at least 20 injured.

Jeff Merkley (D-OR) headed to the Senate floor to start talking about why he was opposed to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court ""for as long as I am able.""

"The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has condemned North Korea’s “provocative nuclear rhetoric” during a trip to South Korea that included a visit to the heavily armed border dividing the peninsula.
Harris arrived in Seoul on Thursday, hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, in a move that underlines Washington’s struggle to rein in the regime’s weapons programme.
Her visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) – which has divided the peninsula since the 1950-1953 Korean war ended in an uneasy truce – was intended to demonstrate..."

"Three top Jeb Bush fundraisers abruptly parted ways with his presidential campaign on Friday, amid internal personality conflicts and questions about the strength of his candidacy, POLITICO has learned.
There are different versions of what transpired. The Florida-based fundraising consultants — Kris Money, Trey McCarley, and Debbie Aleksander — have said that they voluntarily quit the campaign and were still working with Bush's super PAC, Right to Rise Super PAC.

"Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, which to date has raised significantly more than his Republican rivals’, is encountering difficulties matching its torrid pace as Mr. Bush slips in the polls and top party donors continue to withhold their commitments.
A finance aide for Mr. Bush sent an email to contributors Friday with an invitation to a breakfast fund-raiser in Washington next month with a pointed plea that the former Florida governor’s supporters find new donors.
“Please note – this is new money only,” wrote Sarah Corsaro, the staff member, adding: “We..."
"- It's the question everyone's asking: Did Mitt Romney get a bounce out of last week's Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida?
According to a new national poll released Tuesday, just before the start of the Democratic convention, the GOP presidential nominee appears to have received a one-point convention bounce, normal for the modern political era."
"President Donald Trump said Friday that he would not fire his adviser Kellyanne Conway, despite the US Office of Special Counsel's recommendation that she be removed from federal service for several violations of the Hatch Act.
""No, I'm not going to fire her. I think she's a terrific person,"" Trump told Fox News' ""Fox and Friends.""
""I got briefed on it yesterday and it looks to me like they're trying to take away their right of free speech. And that's just not fair,"" Trump added. ""She's got to have the..."
"An interview with ""60 Minutes"" probably made a lot of sense when Education Secretary Betsy DeVos agreed to it. DeVos has a brand problem -- she is greeted by protesters almost everywhere she goes and is widely cast as an out-of-touch plutocrat. And, given that she is heading up President Donald Trump's new committee aimed at figuring out solutions to curb school violence, it seemed like a perfectly-timed moment for DeVos to (re)introduce herself to the public."
"President Trump — under pressure from angry, grieving students from a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last week — ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas."
"In a swift and severe response, Jordan authorities executed at dawn Wednesday two Iraqi terror convicts just hours after Islamic State militants released a video showing a Jordanian pilot burned to death in a cage.
The hangings underscored the hardening stance by officials in Jordan, a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State, after street protests calling for revenge against the militant group.
The backlash from the video — released while Jordan’s King Abdullah II was holding talks in Washington — also threatened to draw the usually..."
"History can be a wise teacher, but it's also crucial to take the right lessons. Confronted with a should-they-or-shouldn't-they proposal on impeachment, Democrats worry that if they fail to learn history's lessons, they are doomed to repeat them.
As they held a conference call to consider the Mueller report on Monday, party leaders in the House tried to resist falling into the same trap as Republicans who tried to oust President Bill Clinton and paid a heavy short-term political price.
They also stepped up their post-Mueller investigations by subpoenaing President..."
"It turns out there was a coordinated attack on the 2020 election after all. It began several years ago and accelerated in the last several months. Now that Election Day has passed, it has launched into overdrive.
Its weapons are baseless insinuation and evidence-free charges, deployed solely to sow chaos and undermine the results of a free and fair election — one that produced a clear winner and an even clearer loser.
But the most dangerous attackers of American democracy aren’t the Russians or the Chinese. They are the leaders..."
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin all but delivered a death blow to President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion domestic initiative, throwing his party’s agenda into jeopardy, infuriating the White House and leaving angry colleagues desperate to salvage what’s left of a top priority.
The West Virginia senator’s announcement that he could not support the bill, delivered on “Fox News Sunday” after only a cursory heads-up to the president’s staff, potentially derails not only Biden’s “Build Back Better Act,” but sparks fresh questions over passing voting rights legislation and potentially other significant bills that..."
"Consumer prices roared higher last month, rising at their fastest pace in decades.
Inflation rose 5% in the 12-months ending in May, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. That marked the biggest jump since August 2008.
Stripping out food and energy costs, which tend to be more volatile, inflation stood at 3.8% over that 12- month period. It was the biggest increase in so-called core inflation since June 1992.
In the month of May alone, prices rose 0.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis, slightly less than in April. Core inflation, excluding food and..."
"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been charged under seal, prosecutors inadvertently revealed in a recently unsealed court filing — a development that could significantly advance the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and have major implications for those who publish government secrets."
"Mitch McConnell said something very odd Tuesday in an interview with Fox News Channel. Asked about the ongoing bipartisan effort in the Senate to pass legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller, McConnell said this: ""I don't think he should fire Mueller and I don't think he's going to. So this is a piece of legislation that isn't necessary in my judgment."" He added (bolding is mine): ""There's no indication that Mueller's going to be fired."""
"Newly released documents suggest that Ms. Yovanovitch was being watched in Kyiv while she was the U.S. ambassador there.
The police in Ukraine have opened a criminal investigation into whether allies of President Trump had the United States ambassador to the country under surveillance while she was stationed in Kyiv, the Ukrainian government said on Thursday.
Democrats in the House of Representative on Tuesday revealed text messages to and from Lev Parnas — an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer — pointing to surveillance of the ambassador,..."
"Ukraine's national police are investigating allegations that U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was under surveillance in Kyiv last spring — an allegation made in WhatsApp messages between a U.S. politician and Lev Parnas.

The texts between Parnas and Robert F. Hyde, a Trump supporter and retired Marine who is running for Congress in Connecticut, suggested..."
NATIONAL HARBOR Md. -- National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre attempted to turn the tables Friday on those in the media and government who have recently characterized the gun lobbyists talking points as crazy. In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference LaPierre accused the federal government the Department of Homeland Security so-called Washington elites and Vice President Joe Biden of offering illogical solutions to the challenges of gun violence.
"The president says the anonymous intelligence official must instead testify publicly.
President Donald Trump on Monday rejected an offer by the lawyer for the anonymous whistleblower at the center of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry to submit written answers to questions from Republican lawmakers.
“The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the leaders of the impeachment probe.
“He must be brought forward to testify,” the president continued. “Written answers not acceptable!”

"Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has withdrawn from consideration to hold the post in a permanent capacity, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday in tweets.
The president said Shanahan had opted to “devote more time to his family.” Trump said he would name Army Secretary Mark Esper as the new acting defense secretary."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan is withdrawing his nomination to lead the Pentagon.
The abrupt announcement came in a tweet from the president, who said Shanahan had done “a wonderful job” but would step aside to “devote more time to his family.”
The president added that the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, will be the new acting secretary.
“I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!” Trump said in a second tweet on the..."
"The Supreme Court said Tuesday that a provision of an Indiana law which said the state may prohibit abortions motivated solely by race, sex or disability should remain blocked.
The court, however, did say it would allow part of the law that requires clinics to bury or cremate fetal remains to take effect.
The fact that the court decided not to take up the more controversial provision of the Indiana law suggests that there is not a current appetite on the court to move aggressively to question the court's core..."
"In an already divided country, political battle lines hardened Tuesday with the prospect that the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade — a move that threatens to upend the 2022 midterm elections and turn the campaign into a massive mobilizing effort over the issues of abortion, individual rights and the contrasting philosophies of the two major political parties.
Supporters of abortion rights and their Democratic allies predicted that the thunderclap heard Monday night with Politico’s publication of a leaked draft opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. would reverberate through..."
"President Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday calling for sanctions against those responsible for the repression of Uighur Muslims in China's far western region of Xinjiang, the White House said in a statement.
The bill, which passed the US Congress with only a single 'no' vote, was intended to send China a strong message on human rights by mandating sanctions against those responsible for the oppression of members of China's Muslim minority."
"Two American swimmers were pulled off their flight to the United States by the Brazilian authorities and detained for several hours on Wednesday night, Olympic officials said. It was the latest indication that the police were skeptical of the swimmers’ claims that they had been held up at gunpoint during the Rio Games."
"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said on Monday that he intended to leave government service in December to “pursue the next chapter” of his career, and that he would step down as President Biden’s top medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which he has led for 38 years.
The announcement by Dr. Fauci, 81, was not entirely unexpected. He has hinted for some time that he was thinking of retiring, saying last month that he would “almost certainly” do so by 2025. In an interview..."
"“Please delete those tweets,” the widower begged in a letter last week to Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. “My wife deserves better.”
Yes, Twitter, Lori Klausutis certainly does deserve better, nearly two decades after she died in a tragic accident that has morphed into a macabre and continuing nightmare for her husband, Timothy Klausutis.
The boogeyman plunging him and the family of his late wife into the very worst of memory holes is a conspiracy-theory-loving, twitchy-fingered and often shameless tweeter who also happens to be the president of the United..."
"Less than two weeks ago, President Trump’s personal attorney William Consovoy stood before a panel of federal appellate judges and told them that the president is immune from criminal investigation even if Trump shoots someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue.
It didn’t take long for that panel to reject this extraordinary argument. On Monday, an unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that Trump is not immune from such investigations. The case is Trump v. Vance.
Vance arises from Manhattan District Attorney..."
"President Trump has lost another legal fight in his efforts to keep his tax returns private. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Trump's accounting firm must turn over his tax returns to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.

""The decision of the Second Circuit will be taken to the Supreme Court. The issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic. The constitutional issues are..."
"President Biden on Tuesday night accepted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's invitation to address a joint session of Congress on April 28. The address is not an official State of the Union because a president's first speech before Congress is not considered a State of the Union.

The patient who died was a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions, according to Washington state health officials.

"President Donald Trump preached calm on Saturday after the first U.S. death from coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state and the government ratcheted up travel warnings for several countries where the virus is spreading.
The president, flanked by his top health officials, said that Americans should not be alarmed by the latest news. ""If you are healthy, you will probably go through a process and you'll be fine,"" he said. Fifteen people have recovered from the virus, he added."
"The New York state attorney general's office has widened its probe into the Trump Organization to include an examination of potential criminal wrongdoing, according to the office's spokesman.
Previously, the office was investigating former President Donald Trump's namesake company in a solely civil matter with New York Attorney General Letitia James focusing on whether the company improperly valued its assets for loan and tax purposes.
However, now the state's investigation has entered ""a criminal capacity,"" spokesman Fabien Levy confirmed to NPR late Tuesday.
""We have informed the Trump Organization that..."
"New York Attorney General Letitia James's investigation into the Trump Organization is now considered a criminal matter, James's office said Tuesday night, noting that officials with the former president's company were recently apprised of the development.
""We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the company is no longer purely civil in nature,"" said Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for the attorney general's office. ""We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment at this time.""..."

"Time tends to warp in the vicinity of a presidential election, so you may have forgotten about one odd incident that occurred late last October.
On Oct. 29, Fox News host Tucker Carlson made a remarkable allegation. He had been sent a cache of documents offering revealing information about the family of the Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden. These were “documents that are directly relevant to the presidential campaign just six days from now,” Carlson insisted — but they had inexplicably vanished. A member of his staff had given..."
"Nine witnesses will testify at five hearings between Tuesday and Thursday.
House Democrats have set up a packed schedule for their second full week of impeachment inquiry hearings, with nine witnesses set to testify between Tuesday and Thursday.

We’ve embedded a live stream above, and you can also watch it on C-SPAN or on Vox’s..."
The Justice Department has announced charges against an NSA contractor for allegedly leaking classified information to a news organization. 25 year old Reality Winner reportedly removed confidential information from an NSA site in Georgia. The charges were announced after The Intercept published an NSA briefing about the alleged Russian meddling in last year's election.
"A federal judge in New York on Wednesday struck down a new Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care clinicians to refuse to provide abortions for moral or religious reasons.
U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York rejected the federal rule after women's groups, health organizations and multiple states sued the Department of Health and Human Services, arguing the exemptions were unconstitutional.
Engelmayer ruled that the so-called conscience rule was too coercive, allowing HHS to withhold billions in federal funding unless health..."
"NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a new Trump administration rule that could open the way for more health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds.
U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and went beyond existing law in issuing the rule. He also said that the measure could be costly, burdensome and damaging to emergency care and that the whole rationale for the rule was..."
"Raising the prospect of lasting fissures in the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders rebuffed mounting pressure on Tuesday to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada, throwing chairs and later threatening the state party chairwoman in a fight over delegates. The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the party’s attention to the general election."
"Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz panned Bernie Sanders' response to reports of violence at the Nevada Democratic state convention over the weekend, calling it ""anything but acceptable.""
Wasserman Schultz was speaking on CNN on Tuesday night, after a day in which the Sanders campaign exchanged pointed public statements with the DNC and the Nevada Democratic Party over allegations that the campaign encouraged ""extra-parliamentary behavior — indeed, actual violence"" at the convention, in the words of the state Democ"

"Hillary Clinton is determined to get under Donald J. Trump’s skin at Monday’s debate, and is testing attack lines to try to rattle him.
Mr. Trump is largely shunning traditional debate preparations, but has been watching video of Mrs. Clinton’s best and worst debate moments, looking for her vulnerabilities."
"Transport Secretary Elaine Chao could be in for a bumpy ride after The Wall Street Journal reported that she still owns stock in a road-paving company, more than a year after she promised to get rid of it. Chao’s holdings are in Vulcan Materials, which is the largest U.S. supplier of stone, sand, and gravel used in road-paving and building. The stock price has risen nearly 13 percent since April 2018, the month Chao said she would ditch the shares, meaning she’s gained more $40,000 since the promise was made...."
"The path to the White House is paved with former frontrunners -- or maybe call them buzzleaders, since we're three years away from 2016 and nobody is officially running for president yet.
Time magazine has put three different GOP lawmakers on its cover. First it was Marco Rubio. Then it was Rand Paul. Now it is Chris Christie.
Don't forget to sprinkle that seasoning over all the sugary buzz surrounding Christie, who was emphatically reelected as New Jersey governor this week.
The foreshadowing was evident as he..."
"Since news of the SolarWinds hack surfaced nearly a week ago, high-ranking Trump administration officials had remained largely silent about the cyberattack that involved at least half a dozen federal agencies. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke that silence, becoming the most prominent administration official to blame Russia for the attack.
""This was a very significant effort,"" Pompeo told the The Mark Levin Show, ""and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."""
"President Trump addressed the ongoing cyber hacks of the U.S. government for the first time on Saturday, seeking to turn blame away from Moscow in defiance of mounting evidence while downplaying how devastating the intrusions appear to be.
In a bizarre outburst on Twitter that Trump’s critics condemned for its alarming disconnect from the facts, the president contradicted his top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Friday pinned the breaches that have afflicted at least five major federal agencies “clearly” on Russia. Rather, the president baselessly suggested that..."
"It’s long been a mystery what President George H.W. Bush thought of President George W. Bush’s response to the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent invasion of Iraq. Bush 41, of course, had stopped short of ousting Saddam Hussein; Bush 43 had gone ahead and done just that. But what was said behind closed doors in Crawford or Kennebunkport?"

Musk’s lawyers sent a letter to Twitter saying he is “terminating their merger agreement,” according to the filing. In the letter, Musk argues he has a right to drop out of the deal because Twitter hasn’t given him enough information about the company’s business."
"Thursday marks the second Thanksgiving during the coronavirus pandemic. Many grandparents are excitedly planning to see their grandchildren. Friends are dressing their dining tables for turkey and loved ones. Some people have flights booked or road trips scheduled.
But in the background, Covid-19 case numbers are inching upward across the United States and millions of Americans remain unvaccinated -- leaving some people worried about the possible Covid-19 risks that could come with their Thanksgiving plans.
If you have concerns, experts say there are some important questions to ask to help weigh your..."

"President Barack Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been locked in a public feud over whether free trade agreements can be used to undermine the 2010 Wall Street reform law. On Wednesday, the Canadian government sided with Warren.
Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver gave a speech in New York arguing that the Volcker Rule -- a key tenet of the 2010 banking law -- violates the North American Free Trade Agreement. The move underscores Warren's warning that such deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama is currently negotiating, jeopardize..."
"Even before the coronavirus pandemic changed everything about, well, everything, Black Friday was already on its last legs. The post-Thanksgiving shopping holiday kept creeping up earlier and earlier. Retailers started opening their stores before dawn on Friday, then at midnight, encouraging shoppers to wait in line for doorbusters before they had even finished digesting their turkey and mashed potatoes. Eventually they threw caution to the wind and started opening on Thursday afternoons, well before most people had gotten a chance to eat dinner at all.
This year, thanks to the..."
"America's economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter of 2022, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Thursday.
The nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic activity -- declined at an annualized rate of 1.4% between January and March in an abrupt reversal of the prior year's strong growth.
While one quarter does not yet make a trend, it is a warning sign for how the recovery is going: Two straight quarters of declining growth meet a commonly used definition of a recession.
It was a marked..."
"The beloved actor/director, 82, was the ""mystery guest"" at the Republican Convention, a warm-up act for Sen. Mario Rubio of Florida, who introduced candidate Romney. He strode out on the stage, hair uncombed and a little wild, with his familiar, stiff-legged authority, and proceeded to deliver an improvised piece of performance art that triggered unintentional amusement and confusion within the Tampa Bay Times Forum and throughout the viewing audience."
"House Democrats are retiring in numbers not seen in decades as a dire political outlook, new district lines and a negative environment at the US Capitol have combined into a toxic brew for lawmakers considering their political futures.
On Tuesday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice became the 30th Democrat to announce plans to not seek re-election in 2022. By comparison, only 13 House Republicans are planning to call it quits or seek higher office.

"President Joe Biden spoke to the nation Friday on the crisis with Russia over Ukraine, amid increased shelling in eastern Ukraine and possible false-flag attacks he said Russia could use to falsely justify an invasion.
Answering questions afterward, he appeared to go further than he has before about what Russian President Vladimir Putin might do, saying, ""As of this moment, I am convinced he has made the decision"" to invade."
"The Lone Star State does not have the best track record as a sovereign power. The Republic of Texas survived only 10 years from independence to annexation by the United States in 1845. Texas seceded during the Civil War — and, with the rest of the Confederacy, was crushed.

And the United States should let Texas go! Better yet, let’s offer Texas a severance package that..."

An F.B.I. memo on Jan. 5 warning of people traveling to Washington for “war” at the Capitol never made its way to top law enforcement officials. The Capitol Police failed to widely circulate information its own..."
"Israel’s longest-serving prime minister was a polarizing figure who sidelined efforts to resolve the Palestinian conflict but opened relations with four Arab countries.
He came to power like some conqueror from a distant land called Philadelphia.

On Tuesday, Fox released exclusive video of Pelosi visiting a San Francisco salon even though salons in the city were officially closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

As with the House bill, the primary feature of it is that it will destroy Medicaid to provide those big tax cuts to the rich."
"Donald Trump has talked big about the action he was going to take to combat the opioid epidemic, describing it as a “national emergency,” which he said he was “saying officially, right now” back in August. Except he wasn't actually officially declaring a national emergency then or at any of the other times he decided to try to sound serious about opioids. The day of the official declaration has come and … Trump isn’t declaring a national emergency. Instead, he’s declaring a public health emergency."
"America's real estate market may be showing signs of a housing bubble as prices become “unhinged from fundamentals,” according to the authors of a blog post published by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank.
House prices can fall out of sync with market fundamentals like supply and demand when there is a widespread belief that prices will keep climbing.

"With the pace of U.S. coronavirus vaccinations relatively flat, President Biden called on Tuesday for employers to set up clinics at work and to offer paid time off for workers as part of a renewed push to reach tens of millions of Americans who remain unvaccinated.
“Please get vaccinated now — it works, it’s free, it’s never been easier,” Mr. Biden said in brief remarks. “It’s never been more important. Do it now for yourself and the people you care about — for your neighborhood, for your country. It sounds corny, but..."
"On Saturday night, President Trump was not having the sort of evening he prefers. For starters, he was dressed in white-tie finery, not the golf-ready khakis he favors on weekends. He was surrounded by the very members of the mainstream media he routinely derides. And rather than his beloved Fox News, his entertainment was skits and musical acts, some of which poked fun at him."

"Students who have been exposed to the coronavirus can safely continue in-person learning if they are regularly tested for the virus at school, avoiding disruptive at-home quarantines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
The CDC released two studies that show the effectiveness of what’s known as “test-to-stay.” School districts across the country have tried this strategy, though it is not widely used.
“These studies demonstrate that test-to-stay works to keep unvaccinated children in school safely,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters Friday. She called it “a promising and now..."
"The first night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention was about highlighting ordinary Americans, and the second night was about putting the spotlight on its leaders — the figures who dominated the party in decades prior and those who hope to take the reins in the decades ahead.

"After former first lady Michelle Obama's foreboding address Monday about the consequences of a second term for President Trump, and her urgent appeal that people ""vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,"" the second night of the Democratic National Convention focused on building the case for how Biden would restore a country struggling in an economic and public health crisis.
The main messenger — Jill Biden — delivered an intimate speech that wove together her career as an educator with her story about how her partnership with..."
"The 2000 election was so close that it came down to 537 votes in one state, so close that the Supreme Court ended up deciding who would be the next president – five weeks after the election.
Was America divided? We sure thought so back then. I spent most of the next year traveling between Montclair, New Jersey, and Franklin, Tennessee, two towns that voted heavily for Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, respectively, and wrote a series for USA TODAY called One Nation, Divided.
My final day of research for the entire project was..."
"Justice Anthony Kennedy, the man who so often determines the outcome of the most controversial Supreme Court cases, is himself the center of brewing speculation.
Will he stay or will he go?
The rumors have swirled for months and the 80-year-old justice has done nothing either personally or though intermediaries to set the record straight on whether he will step down."

"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin on Wednesday announced a deal on an energy and health care bill, representing a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again.
But it will face furious GOP opposition.
The deal is a major reversal for Manchin, and the health and climate bill stands a serious chance of becoming law as soon as August -- assuming Democrats can pass the bill in the House and that it passes muster with the Senate parliamentarian to allow it to be approved..."
"The three White men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery nearly two years ago in a case that sparked nationwide outrage and protests, were sentenced Friday to life in prison, two of them without the possibility of parole.
Travis McMichael, his father Greg McMichael and their neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan chased and killed Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, in February 2020. Their pursuit of Arbery in pickup trucks through suburban streets near Brunswick, Ga., ended with Travis McMichael fatally shooting Arbery, who was unarmed. All three face federal hate-crime charges in a..."

"It was an eventful year to say the least. It began with a historic impeachment, and then the global pandemic, a reckoning around racial injustice, a tumultuous election and even more unlikely news.
The events of 2020, however significant, had an effect on everyone. NPR's Morning Edition wanted to know what helped get people through the tough times — and hundreds responded on Twitter.
Some said they turned to writing letters, creating art or starting a new hobby. Others relied on friends and family and mindless escapist TV shows. And..."
"In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surprising amount of positive news to celebrate this past year. Let’s start with the obvious: 2020 was a massively disappointing year, right from the jump. In January, we learned that 162 billionaires have the same wealth as half of humanity, and that we’d just muddled through the hottest decade on record. Then, February came and the coronavirus pandemic began to touch all of us.
The losses piled on after that: the death of more than 1.7 million people worldwide from COVID-19,..."
"After five years of bitter clashes, Republican congressional leaders and President Obama on Monday night appeared to settle their last budget fight by reaching a tentative deal that would modestly increase spending over the next two years, cut some social programs, and raise the federal borrowing limit."
"President Biden on Tuesday announced a truce in a long-running trade war with the European Union, saying it was time to put aside the fight and focus together on the growing trade threats posed by China.
His Brussels stop at EU headquarters was the latest part of his mission to mend ties with allies that were strained by the go-it-alone approach of his predecessor before he sits down with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva.
Biden was also set to launch a trade and technology council during his session with Ursula von..."

"DETROIT (AP) — Bernie Sanders proved his 2016 presidential bid was serious with an upset victory in Michigan powered by his opposition to free trade and appeal among working-class voters. Four years later, the same state could either revive the Vermont senator’s campaign or relegate him to the role of protest candidate.
Michigan and five other states hold presidential contests on Tuesday at a critical point in the Democratic race.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking to quash Sanders’ hopes and cement his own front-runner status just a week..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties Friday to illegally annex more occupied Ukrainian territory in a sharp escalation of his war. Ukraine’s president countered with a surprise application to join the NATO military alliance.
Putin’s land-grab and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s signing of what he said is an “accelerated” NATO membership application sent the two leaders speeding faster on a collision course that is cranking up fears of a full-blown conflict between Russia and the West.
Putin vowed to protect newly annexed regions of Ukraine by “all available means,” a renewed..."
"Senator Bernie Sanders, Independent of Vermont, announced Thursday that he was running for president as a Democrat, injecting a progressive voice into the contest and providing Hillary Rodham Clinton with her first official rival for the party’s nomination.
Avoiding the fanfare that several Republicans have chosen so far when announcing their candidacies, Mr. Sanders issued a statement to supporters that laid out his goals for reducing income inequality, addressing climate change and scaling back the influence of money in politics."
"They’re a source of frustration. A risk to their fellow citizens. A threat to the nation’s economic recovery.
President Joe Biden is trying to concentrate the anger of the nation’s inoculated majority against the stubborn 25% of eligible Americans who remain unvaccinated against COVID-19.
Nearly 8 months after declaring “war” on the coronavirus as he took office, Biden announced far-reaching new federal requirements Thursday that could force millions to get shots. In doing so, he embraced those who haven’t rolled up their sleeves as a new foe amid a devastating..."

"CNN+, the streaming service that was hyped as one of the most significant developments in the history of CNN, will shut down on April 30, just one month after it launched.
CNN+ customers ""will receive prorated refunds of subscription fees,"" the company said.
The decision was made by new management after CNN's former parent company, WarnerMedia, merged with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery earlier this month.
The prior management team's vision for CNN+ runs counter to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav's plan to house all of the company's..."
"QAnon followers were speculating on Tuesday night that Facebook’s new ban on all QAnon groups and pages was part of a complex plan by the Trump administration to root out the “deep state” and arrest their enemies. Or the social media company was trying to squelch the impending news that President Trump was about to crack down on his foes.
QAnon believers were making both arguments. Neither was true.
Earlier on Tuesday, Facebook announced it would remove any group, page or Instagram account associated with the QAnon conspiracy. Within 24..."
"A bipartisan group of senators is expected to introduce a $908 billion coronavirus relief bill as soon as Monday, with a twist: The deal is expected to be split into two pieces, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
One would be a $748 billion piece of coronavirus relief with less controversial items like schools and health care; the other would marry $160 billion in money for local governments with a temporary liability shield."
"As the coronavirus death toll in the United States soars to almost 300,000, the question of Congress approving a new round of aid remains.
Negotiations were stalled for months, but on Dec. 1, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced a roughly $908 billion stimulus proposal while additional proposals were also introduced with some differences. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell initially rejected the bipartisan proposal, but then offered his own proposal aimed to support businesses.
Since then, lawmakers have continued to negotiate, but it’s unclear when Congress will pass a..."

"The Justice Department is justified in withholding millions of dollars in grants from cities and states for refusing to enforce the Trump Administration’s immigration laws, according to a Wednesday ruling by a federal appeals court. The order specifically targets “sanctuary cities,” which are known to protect immigrants who have not committed crimes from deportation. The ruling overturns a district court judge’s order for the DOJ to release funding to cities and states including New York City, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia. The states and cities filed a lawsuit against..."
"Governments around the world must consider drastic steps to slash oil demand in the face of an emerging global energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency warned on Friday.

The recommendations for advanced economies like the United States and European Union would aim to offset the feared loss of nearly..."
"July may be the month that voter suppression died.
In the latest of a string of shocking judicial decisions, a federal appeals court Friday struck down North Carolina’s voting restrictions, some of the strictest in the nation. Today’s action comes after the normally conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Texas’s Voter ID laws, and a federal district court placed an injunction against Wisconsin’s."
"A U.S. appeals court on Friday struck down a North Carolina law that required voters to show photo identification when casting ballots, ruling that it intentionally discriminated against African-American residents.
The ruling, a victory for rights advocates that will enable thousands of people to vote more easily, is also likely to be seen as a boost for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton going into the election on Nov. 8."
"On paper, Donald J. Trump is the last candidate one would expect to raise eyebrows within the Jewish community.
He is from the city with the country’s largest Jewish population, and he made his fortune working among the Jewish machers in New York’s real estate industry. His Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, was effectively marketed as a Jewish alternative to the town’s private clubs that had historically excluded Jews. His daughter Ivanka married an Orthodox Jew and converted. He endorsed Benjamin Netanyahu for prime minister of Israel. (“Terrific guy, terrific leader.”)..."
"This time, President Barack Obama is going to have to actually talk about Obamacare in his State of the Union address.
No more touch-the-base-and-keep-running treatments, the way he’s handled it the past couple of years. This time, he’ll be expected to linger on base a bit, at least long enough to acknowledge the launch of the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency — and do it in the least awkward way possible."
"Memo to the White House: The website may be fixed, but President Barack Obama's new health insurance markets have yet to win over most consumers.

"Michael Sussmann, a former lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, is set to go on trial Monday for a single charge of lying to the FBI, as part of Special Counsel John Durham's three-year investigation of the Trump-Russia investigation.
But the trial is shaping up to be about something much bigger than whether Sussmann lied about his clients while passing on a tip to the FBI alleging suspicious ties between former President Donald Trump and Russia.
Durham's prosecution team, in court documents and pre-trial hearings, has pursued a strategy of casting Sussmann's actions..."
"President Trump alienated the United States’ closest allies at the Group of Seven summit in Canada with his aggressive trade declarations and surprising suggestion that Russia be readmitted to the exclusive club of major economic powers — and then, after departing early, went on Twitter to blow up the agreement forged at the meeting."
"The useless agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel is nothing but a ploy to artificially inflate the Trump administration’s foreign policy achievements ahead of the election. In real terms, it was nothing but leaders trading with used goods.
On Thursday, President Trump announced that U.S. diplomats had brokered a major breakthrough. The agreement basically declares that the corrupt government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will postpone its plans for the unilateral annexation of occupied Palestinian land in return for normalization with a small but rich Arab Gulf..."
"President Trump on Friday strode to a lectern in the White House Rose Garden to tout an unexpectedly good jobs report that showed the U.S. unemployment rate falling in May to 13.3 percent, as 2.7 million people who had been furloughed due to the coronavirus crisis returned to work.
During a 45-minute, stream-of-consciousness, often rambling speech, Trump all but declared victory in his administration’s response to both the pandemic and protests over the death of George Floyd, calling the jobs report a “tremendous tribute to equality.”
The president said..."

"FBI Director Chris Wray told lawmakers Tuesday that the FBI has not seen any evidence indicating that the rioters who took part in the January 6 US Capitol attack were ""fake Trump protesters,"" knocking down a baseless claim that has been pushed by Republican Sen.

"When the New York Times revealed a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh this weekend, the political world was again thrown into turmoil. Democrats, including several presidential candidates, called for further investigations and impeachment, while President Trump and top Republicans staunchly defended the embattled judge.
But amid that furor, the Times also weathered fierce criticism over how it framed the news and promoted it on social media. On Sunday, the newspaper apologized for a tweet that said the type of misconduct in the claim..."

Akin, who has been frantically trying to salvage his once-promising bid against incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill, insisted the uproar surrounding his remarks was an overreaction to misspeaking ""one word in one sentence on one day."""
"A defiant Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri said Tuesday he will stay in the Senate race to unseat Democrat Claire McCaskill despite mounting calls from across the political spectrum for him to withdraw over incendiary comments on rape and pregnancy.

Debate on the floor was raucous and Democrats several times angrily screamed at Republicans and accused them of dismissing the needs of low income Americans."
"Republicans muscled a pared-back agriculture bill through the House on Thursday, stripping out the food stamp program to satisfy recalcitrant conservatives but losing what little Democratic support the bill had when it failed last month. It was the first time food stamps had not been a part of the farm bill since 1973."
"The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a New York prosecutor is entitled to see President Trump’s private and business financial records, ending an intense legal battle waged by the president to keep them secret.
The court said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. had the authority to subpoena the records from Trump’s private accounting firm. Trump had claimed an immunity from criminal investigations while in office.
Read the Supreme Court’s opinion: Trump v. Vance
Vance is investigating whether the Trump Organization falsified business records to conceal hush payments to..."
"Quick, can you hear it? That creaking sound from Washington is the nerves of congressional Democrats in response to the political firestorm raging around Obamacare.
The botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act's vital new marketplaces, coupled with insurers notifying more than a million Americans that their policies were being canceled, raised questions about the administration competence and honesty in selling and implementing President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms."
"A gunman suspected of killing five police officers during a protest march in downtown Dallas late Thursday told negotiators before he died that he was upset over recent police-involved shootings of African Americans and ""wanted to kill white people, especially white officers,"" Dallas Police Chief David Brown said."
"On Thursday night, Sen. Thom Tillis (R) and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham bumped elbows at their final debate in the contentious North Carolina race that could determine which party controls the Senate.
Not 24 hours later, both candidates’ lives — and possibly the fate of the upper chamber — were upended, as Tillis tested positive for the novel coronavirus and Cunningham acknowledged sending illicit texts to a woman who is not his wife.
Now, both men are in their homes, one self-isolating and the other dodging reporters asking about those..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says a committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection “will do the job it set out to do” despite Republicans’ vow to boycott the probe.
House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday that Republicans won’t participate after Pelosi rejected two of the Republicans he chose to sit on the panel, Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio. Pelosi made clear on Thursday that she won’t relent, telling reporters that the two men “took actions that made it ridiculous to put them on..."
"During 28 years as a state and federal prosecutor, I prosecuted a lot of sexual assault cases. The vast majority came early in my career, when I was a young attorney at a prosecutor’s office outside Detroit.
A year ago, Tara Reade accused former Vice President Joe Biden of touching her shoulder and neck in a way that made her uncomfortable, when she worked for him as a staff assistant in 1993. Then last month, Reade told an interviewer that Biden stuck his hand under her skirt and forcibly..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden is finally speaking out against allegations of sexual assault, in a carefully orchestrated set of releases. On Friday, Biden released a statement on Medium denying the allegations made by his former Senate aide, Tara Reade. Soon after, he appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to reiterate his innocence. In the post, after noting that April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month, reminding readers of his leadership in the Violence Against Women Act, and acknowledging the “importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be..."
"A panel of three federal judges struck down Ohio’s congressional map on Friday, ruling the districts were so severely drawn to benefit Republicans that they violated the U.S. Constitution.
The panel blocked Ohio lawmakers from using the map in any future elections, and it gave lawmakers until June 14 to come up with a new plan.
Republicans controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and drew lines that gave them a 12-4 electoral advantage in the state’s congressional delegation. They have maintained that advantage since.
The court said the..."
"A federal court has ruled that Ohio's congressional map is an ""unconstitutional partisan gerrymander"" and must be redrawn by the 2020 election.
In their ruling Friday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio argue that the map was intentionally drawn ""to disadvantage Democratic voters and entrench Republican representatives in power."" The court argues the map violates voters' constitutional right to choose their representatives and exceeds the state's powers under Article I of the Constitution.
""Accordingly, we declare Ohio's 2012 map an unconstitutional partisan..."
"The House voted on Tuesday night to condemn racist language from President Donald Trump, capping off a tumultuous couple of hours on Capitol Hill including a brief time in which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was barred from speaking in the chamber.
The vote was 240-187. Four Republicans and one independent -- Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan -- supported it as well as all Democrats who voted.
Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, one of the congresswomen Trump attacked, said Tuesday's vote sent a message to young kids who ""are wrestling..."
"The Democratic-led House responded to Donald Trump’s sustained attacks on four female Democratic lawmakers by taking the extraordinary step of rebuking the president for racism.
The resolution -- backed Tuesday by all 235 Democrats, four Republicans and one independent -- accused the president of having “legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color,” a serious accusation that sharply draws the battle lines going into the 2020 elections.
Trump had egged Democrats on, issuing his tweets and incendiary remarks for three straight days. “It’s my opinion..."
"One of the key masterminds behind the 9/11 attacks was killed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, according to the White House.
Ayman al-Zawarhi, the Egyptian militant who assumed leadership of the Al Qaeda terror group after the death of Osama Bin Laden, was killed in a drone-strike over the weekend, President Joe Biden said in a primetime announcement to the nation.  
“On Saturday, at my direction, the United States successfully concluded an air strike in Kabul, Afghanistan that killed the Emir of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawarhi,” Biden said. “He was..."
"The number of Americans filing first-time unemployment claims continued to fall last week to 473,000, a drop of 34,000 from the prior week's revised level, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.
The number was below expectations of 500,000.
The continued downward trend brings the number to its lowest level since March 14, 2020, when it stood at 256,000. The previous week's level was revised up by 9,000 from 498,000 to 507,000. The four-week moving average was 534,000, a decrease of 28,250 from the previous week's revised average. That is also..."
"A COVID-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca has shown ""positive high-level results"" in early data from clinical trials, researchers announced Monday. It is the third vaccine to clear that crucial hurdle, alongside ones made by Pfizer and Moderna.
The vaccine has been 70% effective on average so far, researchers said. The early data came with a potentially promising surprise: The vaccine was 90% effective for volunteers who were given a half-dose of the vaccine followed by a full dose — a much higher success rate than..."
"The U.S. plans to announce its withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council today, according to Reuters. It’s certainly interesting timing, coming just a day after the U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, slammed the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children as “unconscionable.” But the move has been expected for some time now and has more to do with the United States pushing back against U.N. criticism of Israel."
"Wendy Davis, the Texas state senator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate who vaulted to political stardom after a well-publicized filibuster of anti-abortion legislation, writes in her upcoming memoir that she terminated a pregnancy, according to a new report.
According to the San Antonio Express-News, Davis’ book, “Forgetting to Be Afraid,” describes an incident 17 years ago in her second trimester in which she learned that her unborn third daughter — whom she and her then-husband already named Tate Elise — had a serious brain abnormality that appeared potentially life-threatening."
"Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis reveals in a new campaign memoir that she terminated two pregnancies for medical reasons in the 1990s, including one where the fetus had developed a severe brain abnormality.
Davis writes in ""Forgetting to be Afraid"" that she had an abortion after an exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides. The Associated Press purchased an early copy of the book, which hits stores Tuesday.
The memoir also describes ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy,..."
"The Biden administration is facing a ""serious challenge"" at the US southern border, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday, saying the US has encountered an ""unprecedented"" number of migrants illegally crossing the border.
During a news conference in Brownsville, Texas, Mayorkas stressed the sharp increase of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border, many of whom are fleeing deteriorating conditions in their home countries.
In July, US Customs and Border Protection apprehended 212,672 people, up from June and amid some of the hottest summer weeks -- when arrests usually dip -- and of those,..."
"California’s power grid operator on Thursday repeated a call for residents to conserve energy as the state battles extreme heat ahead of Labor Day.
The electrical grid is “most stressed from higher demand and less solar energy” from 4-9 p.m., said the California Independent System Operator. It issued a “Flex Alert” for Friday calling on residents to take action during those hours — the third day in a row with such a warning.
“With triple-digit temperatures in much of California and the West, the power grid operator is again expecting..."
"There are 36 days left until Election Day, and that means that every day matters. But the next five days matter more than most when it comes to the races final outcome.
Heres why: There are two seminal events in the campaign this week Ã¢â‚¬â€ the first presidential debate on Wednesday night and the release of the September jobs report on Friday morning.
Yes, we know Ã¢â‚¬â€ and have written about Ã¢â‚¬â€ the fact that the general election debates in a presidential race may be less than meets the..."
"We're nearly to the last of the many milestones that come along during presidential campaigns.
The primaries? Long over.
The conventions? All wrapped up.
Labor Day, when voters supposedly start paying attention? That was four weeks ago.
Now we turn to the debates, which begin Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. The first setting: The University of Denver. The focus: Domestic policy. The moderator: Jim Lehrer from PBS-TV's NewsHour. The stars (just for the record, we suspect you know by now): President Obama and his Republica"
"It took the lowest vault score of her Olympic gymnastics career for Simone Biles to seal her position as the greatest of all time. She gave up having others judge where she might place and put herself first.
After failing to land a vault she's been nailing in competitions since 2018, Biles’ withdrew from the women’s team finals Tuesday. Instead of throwing herself into the air to do a fully extended flip while also spinning around two and a half times, she landed after only having turned around one and a half times."
"President Obama on Sunday called Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of a private email server “a mistake,” but said it had not endangered national security and had been “ginned-up” into a political attack by Republicans eager to keep her from being president.
Mr. Obama made the comments during an interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes” program in which he also defended his policy in Syria during a lengthy, contentious exchange with Steve Kroft, a veteran correspondent.
Mrs. Clinton’s use of the email server during her tenure as secretary of state has become..."
"President Joe Biden was in Florida to see first-hand the destruction caused by Hurricane Ian, once again putting a spotlight on his icy relationship with Gov. Ron DeSantis, the combative Republican leader posed to potentially challenge the Democrat for the presidency in 2024.
For the time being, Biden and DeSantis have put their budding political rivalry aside, and their administrations have worked in concert since the hurricane’s deadly collision with Florida’s west coast. That was on display Wednesday.
Shortly after touring the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast communities by helicopter, Biden was..."
"Justin Trudeau has won a third term as Canada’s prime minister, with his Liberal party set to capture the most seats in the snap election, a result he called a “clear mandate” to get the country through the pandemic.
With results still trickling in late Monday night, Trudeau was on track for another minority government, meaning he will once again need to work with other parties to pass legislation.

"EL PASO — When El Pasoans mark the one-year anniversary of the Walmart shooting Monday, attorney Yvonne Rosales will be one of hundreds of thousands of border residents reflecting on the tragedy afflicted on this city that claimed the lives of 23 people.
But after the candlelight vigils dim, Rosales will be right back at the task she’s been preparing for since she was confirmed as the county’s incoming district attorney — how to take over an office that could prosecute the man authorities say is responsible for one of..."
"As Natalia Miranda lay on the ground, she didn't know how she got there. Her body was severely swollen and her clothes were torn and dirty.
A SUV ran over the 14-year-old a few weeks before Christmas last year. She says she was walking the two blocks between her home in Clive, Iowa, and her junior high school to watch a basketball game.
Neither Natalia or her parents could make sense of what happened but soon, police told the family that it wasn't an accident. The driver, a White..."
"Roberto Jurado hid with his 88-year-old mother between toy machines at the entrance of the Cielo Vista Walmart.
Lying in broken glass, he listened as the sound of gunshots grew closer. Then the man with the AK-47 was only 10 feet away.
""That day, I believe I stared death in the eyes,"" Jurado, 53, said.
But the shooter left after his attention was drawn to a moving vehicle outside the store, and Jurado and his mother survived.
Jurado spent the next few hours helping victims in the Aug...."
"Rashida Tlaib, the Democratic U.S. House member barred by Israel because of her support of a boycott, said she is rejecting the country’s new offer to let her visit her grandmother in the West Bank saying the terms are too restrictive.
“Silencing me & treating me like a criminal is not what she wants for me. It would kill a piece of me. I have decided that visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in -- fighting against racism, oppression & injustice,” the Michigan lawmaker..."
"After the Israeli government agreed to allow U.S. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib entry into the West Bank to visit her relatives during an overseas humanitarian trip, the Michigan Democrat says she's now changing her plans amid widespread outcry, slamming Israeli leadership for their initial ban.
""When I won, it gave the Palestinian people hope that someone will finally speak the truth about the inhumane conditions. I can't allow the State of Israel to take away that light by humiliating me & use my love for my sity"" — grandmother —..."
"The Supreme Court's new term will not include any cases that might decide the issue of same-sex marriage in the U.S., a development that comes after many lower and appeals courts have ruled against states' bans on gay marriage. Advocates on both sides of the issue have been calling for the high court to review the issue and make an official ruling."
"In a recorded speech to his fractured nation, President Ashraf Ghani ignored growing pressure to step aside, even as his soldiers surrender to the Taliban and his close political associates flee the country.
Several of his close political associates have surrendered to the Taliban without a fight or fled into exile. His army has all but collapsed and the warlords he was counting on have proved ineffectual or are bargaining for their lives.
Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, is more isolated than ever, facing pressure to step aside — and not..."
"WHEN PRESIDENT Ronald Reagan signed the bill creating a federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., he warned that “traces of bigotry still mar” the country. This may seem the understatement of the 20th century; it would be an understatement today.
King spoke in his “I Have a Dream” speech of the “sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent.” This would not pass, he explained, “until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.” He said this on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial — not far..."
"More than half a century after an assassin's bullet silenced him, and 35 years after the nation began observing a federal holiday in his honor, Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and legacy still resonate.
As the preeminent voice of the civil rights movement, King's eloquence and vision for a united America made him an icon. His powerful words – delivered through sermons, speeches and books – symbolize a utopia to which our nation always aspires.
Few people in history have been quoted more than King. His message of equality and..."
"Trust the creators of South Park to respond to controversy with… even more controversy.
The long-running satirical cartoon show found itself in a bit of hot water after its most recent episode, “Band in China,” parodied the way that Western media tiptoes around China’s politics and regulations, often kowtowing to the country’s more restrictive policies. Ironically, the response showed life imitating art: China effectively banned all of South Park from its internet. The Hollywood Reporter reports that episodes, clips and even discussions or social media mentions of the show have..."
"The BA.2 subvariant of the omicron variant continues to rapidly spread throughout the U.S., now accounting for about 72 percent of all new Covid-19 cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The new CDC estimate is up from about 55 percent a week ago, when the subvariant, which is thought to be more contagious than the original strain of omicron, became the dominant variant of the coronavirus circulating in the country.
Despite its spread, health experts see no cause for alarm in the U.S.
That's because there..."
"Senior White House aides have in recent days explored new ideas for responding to high gas prices and looked again at some that they had previously discarded, desperate to show that the administration is trying to address voter frustration about rising costs at the pump.
Biden officials are taking a second look at whether the federal government could send rebate cards out to millions of American drivers to help them pay at gas stations — an idea they examined months ago before ruling it out. Aides had found that shortages..."
"Fresh off her double-digit loss in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton sought to undermine surging rival Bernie Sanders here Thursday night, arguing that his expansive agenda for government action on health care, college costs and infrastructure investments is both impractical and far more costly than he has said."
"California’s population continued to decline after falling for the first time on record during the COVID-19 pandemic — but that loss is showing signs of slowing, new demographic data indicate.
The state’s population declined by 117,552 between Jan. 1, 2021, and Jan. 1, 2022, bringing the estimated total population to 39,185,605, according to data released by the state Department of Finance on Monday. The 0.3% decline represents a slowing compared with the 0.59% drop over the nine-month period between the April 2020 census date and that year’s end, demographers said...."
"The United States of America faces two critical emergencies. One is the coronavirus pandemic. The other is the presidency of Donald Trump.
The latter assertion isn't just linked to the Trump administration's well-documented mishandling of the pandemic response. Indeed, Trump is not the first president to be caught short by an unexpected crisis. But other presidents — FDR after Pearl Harbor, George W. Bush after 9/11, Barack Obama after the economy collapsed in 2008 — brought their focus to bear on meeting the great challenges before them. But as anybody..."
"The father and son convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery were both given an additional sentence of life in prison Monday on federal hate crime charges, while their neighbor was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
A judge also required that Travis McMichael, 36, Greg McMichael, 66, and William “Roddie” Bryan, 52, serve their sentences in state prison, not federal prison as had been requested by their attorneys.
""A young man is dead. Ahmaud Arbery will be forever 25. And what happened, a jury found, happened because he’s Black,"" U.S. District..."
"Donald J. Trump’s threat to sue the New York Times for its report about his leaked 1995 state tax returns showing he lost nearly $1 billion is as predictable as it is laughable.
Trump’s lawyer pledged “prompt initiation of appropriate legal action” against the Times, saying the Oct. 1 story was “illegal” because Trump did not authorize the release of his confidential tax returns."
"Fox News Channel should not be struggling right now. It has just completed its 17th year as the most-watched cable news channel, and its third year as the most-watched channel in all of cable TV. It prints money for its owners, the Murdoch family, as part of a cable division that earns more than $1.5bn every quarter. And as the Chinese and North Koreans like to say, it’s as close to the White House as lips and teeth.
There’s also no doubt that it is lurching from one self-inflicted crisis..."
"The European Union is proposing to ban all oil imports from Russia by the end of the year and remove the country's biggest bank, Sberbank, from the SWIFT international payments network.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday the measures would form part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
""We now propose a ban on Russian oil,"" she said during a speech to the European Parliament. ""Let's be clear: it will not be easy. But we simply have to work on it. We will make..."
"If you’re a Democrat who doesn’t want Bernie Sanders to be the party’s nominee, your choice is now clear: You should vote for Joe Biden.
That’s the implication of Biden’s resounding victory in South Carolina. And Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar — to their credit — have both acknowledged this reality by dropping out of the race.
I realize it was only about a week ago that Biden’s campaign seemed grievously wounded, and he has still won only a single primary. So how has he so quickly become the only..."
"If the federal government shuts down starting Tuesday because of a bitter partisan battle over the new health care law, more people say congressional Republicans rather than President Barack Obama would be responsible, according to a new national survey.
A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday morning, hours before funding for the government is scheduled to run out, also indicates that most Americans think Republicans in Congress are acting like spoiled children in this fiscal fight, with the public divided on whether the president is acting like a spoiled child..."
"President Donald Trump suggested Sunday that Joe Biden had ""won"" the presidential election while saying that the election was rigged — a claim that has been widely debunked.
""He won because the Election was Rigged,"" Trump wrote before falsely claiming that no watchers or observers had been allowed.
It was not clear whether the tweet represented a grudging or an accidental concession by Trump that he had lost the election, which he has repeatedly claimed to have won, even after every major news organization projected Biden as the victor.
A..."
"“This is an open invitation to foreign governments to commit crimes to re-elect Trump.”
Legal analysts, attorneys and former prosecutors have joined the growing chorus of criticism of Donald Trump after the president confessed on national TV that he’d willfully receive dirt on his 2020 rivals from foreign powers ― and perhaps not inform the FBI about it.
Trump’s astonishing admission in an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos was described as “despicable” by Walter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
Shaub, who served under..."
"An important election takes place Tuesday in New York City.
But beyond who wins the mayoral primaries there, what happens could have consequences for how millions of Americans vote in the future.
That's because the city, for the first time, is using ranked-choice voting. The method, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference rather than selecting just their top choice, has gained some traction throughout the country, pushed by reformers who say it's a better election system.
New York City, though, is by far the largest jurisdiction to implement ranked-choice voting, and that..."
"Last month this board endorsed Kathryn Garcia for mayor of New York City and urged voters to cast a ballot for her in the June 22 Democratic primary. (Early voting begins June 12.)
Normally, that would be the end of it. But this year’s ballot looks different, for mayor and for other citywide races. Instead of having only one choice in each race, New York City voters have the opportunity to rank up to five candidates, in order of preference.
Ranked-choice voting, as it’s known, has been in use for decades around..."
"Most diets fail. They fail mostly because after a period of bingeing (for example, New Year’s Eve) we set unrealistic goals for reforming our bad ways. In time, self-control breaks down and we hunger to throw open the cupboards and binge again.
The same is true of the American carbon diet. After a period of bingeing (say, the last century), the United States is per capita the most prodigious emitter of carbon dioxide among the world’s top 10 economies. The average American generated around 15 metric tons of carbon per..."
"President Joe Biden is moving swiftly to dismantle Donald Trump’s legacy on his first day in office, signing a series of executive actions that reverse course on immigration, climate change, racial equity and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
The new president signed the orders just hours after taking the oath of office at the Capitol, pivoting quickly from his pared-down inauguration ceremony to enacting his agenda. With the stroke of a pen, Biden ordered a halt to the construction of Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall, ended the ban on travel..."
"In a video released Thursday morning, former vice president Joe Biden formally announced he's running for president in 2020 -- ending months-long speculation about his intentions.
Biden becomes the 20th Democrat to enter the 2020 race, and enters as a high-profile candidate, with decades of experience.
He will hold his first event as a candidate at a union hall in Pittsburgh on Monday.
Following his formal announcement, Biden's first television interview will take place on ABC's ""The View"" on Friday.
Biden opened his announcement video quoting from the Declaration of..."
"Bernie Sanders’s crushing victory in the Nevada caucuses today is much more than one giant leap toward the Democratic Party nomination.
Sanders is, of course, the favorite to win at the convention in Milwaukee. But a closer look at the numbers and demographics of the “Silver State” reveals something much bigger — the seeds of a new electorate rising up, and a fundamental realignment of US politics. And a new party, thoroughly working-class and committed to egalitarian politics, quickly blooming up into the husk of the old one.
While recent..."
"The president has demanded that Democrats approve his trade deal with Canada and Mexico before passing any bipartisan infrastructure bill.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday made an already difficult task even more challenging for lawmakers by calling on Congress to ratify his Mexico-Canada trade deal before passing any bipartisan infrastructure bill.
The demand, which Trump laid out in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ahead of their meeting on infrastructure scheduled for Wednesday, effectively decreases the already slim odds that a..."
"The highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus has forced a return to face masks in some places. Despite the grim disappointment of what might appear to be a step backward, the nation’s pandemic response must not flag. Vaccines have proved to be extraordinarily effective in preventing severe disease and death, and there is no better solution at hand than getting millions more people vaccinated in the United States and the world. Face masks can restrain the spread of this virus. However, it is going to take longer than once hoped. We..."
"Twice a week from her courtroom, Florida 13th Circuit Court Judge Denise Pomponio decides who in Hillsborough County can no longer be trusted with a gun.
In just the last two months, she has taken away the firearm privileges of dozens of people, including a dad accused of threatening to ""shoot everyone"" at his son's school, a woman who police say attempted suicide and then accidentally shot her boyfriend during a struggle for her revolver, a husband who allegedly fired multiple rounds in the street to ""blow off steam"" after..."
"Congress itself is now having so much trouble signing up for the Obamacare exchanges that late Friday the top administrator in the House of Representatives laid out a backup plan in case lawmakers and staff can't get through the process by the time their enrollment ends Monday.
The red flags started reaching critical mass Thursday and Friday, when some staff and members of Congress told House administrators they were having trouble enrolling through the Washington health exchange, known as DC Health Link. The D.C. exchange is"
"All 50 states have now partially emerged from coronavirus lockdowns, but with only a handful of states showing significant improvement in infection rates, some experts caution it could be too soon.
On Wednesday, Connecticut became the final state to begin lifting restrictions, allowing retail shops and restaurants to reopen their doors.
Despite the reopening milestone, health officials say, Americans remain at risk of catching the highly transmissible and sometimes deadly virus.
As of Wednesday afternoon, at least 18 states had registered an upward trend in average daily cases -- a..."
"On Sunday morning, May 12, 1918, Arthur Wolff penned a four-page letter to his mother, Frances, in New York City. A captain in the 306th Infantry Regiment, Wolff was quartered in Calais, France. He was safely behind the lines, but he could hear the distant roar of the giant guns at the front. Wolff wrote to his mother faithfully each week to assure her that he was safe. But this correspondence had special meaning — it was Mother’s Day."
"Protesters in Arizona are chanting ""stop the hate"" and hoping Governor Jan Brewer will stop a controversial 'religious rights' bill. It would allow business owners, as long as they assert it is their religious belief to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. Governor Brewer says she has not yet made up her mind. Miguel Marquez has the latest on the protests.
Anderson discussed this with Arizona State Representative John Kavanagh, who defends voting for this bill and New York University Professor Kenji Yoshino, who breaks down the legal..."
"On Thursday afternoon, President Joe Biden announced that U.S. businesses with over 100 employees will soon need to ensure that their employees are either fully vaccinated or tested weekly.
Within hours, the reaction in the political class was intense. The hashtag #wewillnotcomply was trending on Twitter, Biden was called an authoritarian and a fascist, and Republican governors and the RNC threatened legal action.
Brooke Rollins, the CEO of Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, was one of many to try to bring in the business community. “Businesses across the country should refuse to endorse this..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats spoke to reporters after voting to pass President Biden's sweeping spending bill.
""Today, we had the honor of participating in passing legislation for the people to build back better. As I always say, with women, for the children,"" Pelosi said.
She lauded Biden, saying that while the infrastructure bill was ""was very, very important,"" it ""was not the sum total of his vision.""
Pelosi said she is most excited about family medical leave in this legislation.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called the Build Back Better Act a ""historic piece of..."
"Representative John Conyers, the Democrat who’s the longest-serving member of Congress, is the latest powerful man revealed to be a sexual harasser. Documents detailing a settlement Conyers reached with a former member of his staff who alleged she was fired for rejecting his sexual advances were leaked to Buzzfeed, and the details are bad. Conyers’ career should be over as a result of these revelations."
"President Trump and two of his senior economic advisers on Sunday played down the risk of a recession after a tumultuous week in the markets suggested that the economy is heading onto shaky ground.
In an exchange with reporters in Morristown, N.J., shortly before taking off for Washington on Sunday evening, Trump dismissed the notion that the nation is headed toward a downturn, saying, “I don’t see a recession.”
“I mean, the world is in a recession right now — although that’s too big a statement,” he added, in a..."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence called out his former boss by name on Friday, saying that ""President (Donald) Trump is wrong"" in claiming that Pence had the right to overturn the 2020 election on January 6, 2021.
Speaking at the Federalist Society Florida Chapters conference near Orlando, Pence delivered his strongest response yet to Trump's ongoing efforts to relitigate the 2020 presidential election, calling it ""un-American"" to suggest one person could have decided the outcome.
Pence warned against conservatives who continue to insist the vice president can alter an election, and said it could be..."
"President Biden arrived at Air Force One on Monday with a jaunty step, a playful manner and a huge grin. “Feeling great,” he declared. He meant physically, having finally ended his lengthy bout with Covid-19, but he could have been talking about his presidency writ large.
Mr. Biden has emerged from medical isolation to a new political world. Suddenly, the administration that could not get anything right, that could not catch a break, was on a roll that any president would relish: Major legislation cruising to passage, at least some economic indicators..."
"The attorney general appears before Congress amid reports that the special counsel told him his four-page summary of the investigation caused confusion.
WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr testified before Congress on Wednesday for the first time since the release of a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report of his nearly two-year investigation into Russian election meddling and possible obstruction by President Donald Trump.
The hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee began with heated questions from Democrats, who grilled Barr over reports that Mueller wrote a letter to..."
"Protests over a US supreme court decision that overturned abortion rights continued across the country this weekend. In New York, thousands marched to voice their anger at the ruling that came at the end of a dizzying week around not just reproductive rights but also gun carry laws and the US Capitol attack.
“Not your uterus, not your choice,” many shouted as the demonstrations progressed in Washington DC., New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta and Austin."
"Conservative Supreme Court justices continued to express strong reservations today about Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, suggesting a key provision of the law -- Section 5 -- might be in danger.
That section of the law says that certain states, mostly in the South, must get any changes to voting regulations precleared by federal officials in Washington, D.C. RELATED: Challenge to the Voting Rights Act Reaches"
"A key provision in one of the U.S.s best known civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act, received a highly skeptical and sometimes downright hostile response from the conservative justices at the Supreme Court Wednesday.
During contentious oral arguments, several liberal justices argued vigorously in favor of preserving a portion of the 1965 law which requires parts or all of 16 states to get permission from the Justice Department or a court before changing voting requirements or redrawing election districts

"Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and his Democratic challenger Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes stuck to their scripts — and their time limits — as they met for a debate Friday evening in a hotly contested race that could determine party control of the U.S. Senate.
In battleground Wisconsin, it was a welcome chance for both candidates to clarify their positions on a variety of issues, and though they disagreed on most subjects, their comments were similar to those they’ve made on the campaign trail. Here are the key takeaways:

"Tens of millions of Americans are under record-setting heat alerts again Friday as a heat wave enters its seventh day across the West, with experts warning against walking on asphalt barefoot or touching car handles barehanded for fear of third-degree burns.
Temperatures in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado soared into the 90s and 100s Thursday, but the sizzling heat also spread east to Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa, breaking record after record where observed highs were sweltering by late spring standards.

"Federal prosecutors have unsealed an indictment accusing former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh of using her series of self-published children's books to commit fraud, evade federal taxes and illegally boost her own political campaigns.
Pugh, 69, resigned in May after public outcry over a scandal involving hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of Healthy Holly books that she sold to a nonprofit health care company. She was on the board of that company when she was a state senator, raising questions about self-dealing — and even about the existence of the..."
"Baltimore’s former mayor Catherine E. Pugh has been indicted by a federal grand jury on wire fraud and tax evasion over lucrative book deals for her self-published Healthy Holly children’s series, according to charges made public Wednesday.
Pugh resigned in May after revelations about the deals she allegedly cut with companies connected to the city and state government, setting off another political crisis and setback for the city.
Pugh, 69, was the second Baltimore mayor to leave office in the past decade while facing corruption allegations. The indictment describes a..."
"The death of Queen Elizabeth II, which Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday, is a watershed moment for Britain, at once incomparable and incalculable.
It marks both the loss of a revered monarch — the only one most Britons have ever known — and the end of a figure who served as a living link to the glories of World War II Britain, presided over its fitful adjustment to a post-colonial, post-imperial era and saw it through its bitter divorce from the European Union.
There is no analogous public figure who..."
"The man accused of raping a 10-year-old girl who traveled to Indiana for an abortion was indicted by a grand jury in Ohio Thursday, in a case that became a flashpoint in the debate about the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Gerson Fuentes, 27, was charged with two felony counts of rape in the indictment filed in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in Columbus.
Court records did not appear to list an attorney for Fuentes after the indictment. His arraignment was scheduled for Monday.

The coalition says it’s focus will now be on protecting U.S. personnel and bases in Iraq, and it is suspending training for Iraqi forces.
The coalition’s decision Sunday comes days after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s top commander in Baghdad."
"BAGHDAD — Lawmakers in Iraq heeded the demands of angry citizens and voted on Sunday to expel United States troops from the country, as hundreds of thousands of mourners poured into the streets of Iran to pay their respects to the slain leader of the elite Quds Force, Maj.

The vote is not final until Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi signs the draft bill. Earlier on Sunday, however, Mr. Mahdi indicated that he would do so, having urged lawmakers to oust the United States-led coalition after President..."
Republicans cast the Labor Department report showing another month of sluggish economic growth as evidence that President Obama's policies have failed. Democrats said the recovery will take more time and that the partisan impasse in Congress has hampered progress. But analysts say the latest numbers likely won't change voters' minds.

Some 33 million Californians will be subject to the new order, representing 84% of the state’s population. The state mandated the restrictions in the Southland and Central Valley as capacity at hospitals’ intensive care units hit dangerously low levels.

"President Trump threatened Monday to permanently halt U.S. funding to the World Health Organization and “reconsider” the country’s membership in the United Nations body if it does not “commit to major substantive improvements” within the next 30 days.
In a letter to the WHO posted in a late-night tweet, Trump said the global health agency floundered in its early responses to the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, he continued to attack the organization and its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accusing them of being too soft on China, where the virus..."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he won't skip debates with President Donald Trump this fall, vowing he'll use the opportunity to confront his rival and be a “fact checker on the floor.""
Biden said Thursday there’s no question the debates will take place, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier in the day that she didn’t think Biden should debate the president at all. Pelosi said she knows she disagrees with Biden on this, but she doesn’t think he should “legitimize a conversation” with Trump."

Mr. Miliband stepped down on Friday, opening up a new debate over the party’s direction.

The agent handed out plastic space blankets. The group would have to wait."
"Short of an all-out invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin could take less dramatic action in Ukraine that would vastly complicate a U.S. and allied response. He might carry out what President Joe Biden called a “minor incursion” — perhaps a cyberattack — leaving the U.S. and Europe divided on the type and severity of economic sanctions to impose on Moscow and ways to increase support for Kyiv.
Biden drew widespread criticism for saying Wednesday that retaliating for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the details. “It’s one thing if it’s a..."
"Ahead of a key meeting on Friday between the U.S. and Russia, the Biden administration on Thursday pushed a full-scale campaign to pressure Moscow as Russian leader Vladimir Putin weighs a possible attack on its neighbor Ukraine.
The U.S. approved its NATO allies in the Baltics to provide additional arms to Ukraine, including critical anti-aircraft missiles that escalate U.S. support. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned four Ukrainian officials it accused of working with Russian intelligence, including to form a new government backed by Russian occupying forces. The State Department blasted a..."
"Florida’s state Board of Education banned “critical race theory” from public school classrooms Thursday, adopting new rules it said would shield schoolchildren from curricula that could “distort historical events.”
Florida’s move was widely expected as a national debate intensifies about how race should be used as a lens in classrooms to examine the country’s tumultuous history.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appeared by video at the top of the board’s meeting, urging its members, many of whom he appointed, to adopt the new measures he asserted would serve students with the..."
"On Thursday, Florida’s State Board of Education voted unanimously, at the behest of Republican Gov.

"President Donald Trump spouted numerous baseless conspiracy theories and attacked Black Lives Matter protesters while claiming his own supporters were peacefully demonstrating during a lengthy interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday.
When asked if his supporters should confront Black Lives Matter protesters ― as they have been doing in various cities ― Trump said that should be left to law enforcement. Then, he proceeded to call his base “wonderful, hardworking, tremendous” people who were shocked by the violence and were simply engaging in “peaceful protest.”"
"President Trump on Friday accused James B.

"Johnson & Johnson, the only major drug maker developing a single-dose vaccine for Covid, announced on Friday that its shot provided strong protection against Covid-19, potentially offering another powerful tool in a desperate race against a worldwide rise in virus mutations.
But the results came with a significant cautionary note: The vaccine’s efficacy rate dropped from 72 percent in the United States to 57 percent in South Africa, where a highly contagious variant is driving most cases."
"A global study of nearly 44,000 found that the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson is 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe disease.
The study was conducted in the U.S., Latin America and South Africa. The vaccine did better at preventing disease in the U.S. – 72% — and less well in South Africa – 57% efficacy. The efficacy seen in Latin America was 66%.
The South African results are troubling because of the coronavirus variant spreading there that has now been detected in the U.S., raising concerns..."

The high court issued orders late Friday in two cases where churches had sued over coronavirus-related restrictions in the state. The high court said that for now, California can’t ban indoor worship as it had in almost all of the state because virus cases are high.
The justices said the state can cap indoor services at 25% of a..."

"On Wednesday, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson made comments in a GQ interview condemning homosexuality as sinful and comparable to bestiality, as well as claiming that African Americans were better off under Jim Crow laws. A&E, the network that airs the program, has since suspended Robertson from filming, prompting conservatives to rush to his defense. Even some prominent lawmakers are insisting that his free speech is in danger."
"If there's one thing we can all agree on when it comes to ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson and the fallout from his interview with GQ, it's that everyone has an opinion.
And, to be honest, that's about the only thing we can agree on.
In the 24 hours since GQ released its January profile of Robertson and his family, who draw millions to A&E with their reality show ""Duck Dynasty,"" social media has seen more than its typical overuse of exclamation points and excessive capitalization."

And the whipsawed party establishment now faces immediate choices -- none of which particularly appeal to them."

The four bills, which are unlikely to clear the Senate and become law, are designed to send a message: that Democrats support small police departments, but also improvements to police practices.
Democrats reached a breakthrough deal after months of arguments between progressives and centrists. President Joe Biden and other moderates have worked to distance the party from the “Defund the Police” slogan and activism of the summer..."

The White House has just released the transcript of a now infamous call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky.
Trump is embroiled in a crisis about whether he improperly used his position to try to coerce Zelensky into investigating Trump’s 2020 political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden — perhaps by withholding military aid to the Eastern European country.
Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Ukraine, but he maintains that a phone call he had..."

Biden finally began to remind voters of his experience and accomplishments, not only as a senator, but as vice president, proudly serving at the side of the Democrats' most popular living president. No one else in this race has that resume.
Going forward, Biden needs to continue to focus on his proven ability to get things done, his readiness to lead on day..."

"American hiring rebounded last month after an unusually weak job market in February, but signs still point to a gradual economic slowdown.
The US economy added 196,000 jobs in March, up from 33,000 the prior month. Despite a slight upward revision from the original estimate, February hiring remained the weakest since September 2017.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, a level near historic lows.
While March hiring was robust, it brings the first-quarter average to 180,000 jobs created per month, down from 223,000 per month on average in..."
"Hiring rebounded strongly in March as employers added 196,000 jobs, easing fears that payroll growth is slowing sharply amid a cooling economy.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8%, the Labor Department said Friday.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated 175,000 jobs were added last month.
Job gains for January and February were revised up by a modest 14,000.
After severe, weather-related swings in employment early this year, economists largely anticipated a return to normalcy in March. If anything, Goldman Sachs reckoned below-average snowfall would bolster job gains by about..."
"Global finance leaders meeting in Japan this weekend said they were increasingly worried that the trade dispute between the United States and China, which shows no signs of abating, could propel the world economy into a crisis.
The sense of gloom at the gathering of the Group of 20 major economies came amid increasing evidence that global economic growth is slowing amid President Trump’s renewed trade war with Beijing. In a closing statement, or communiqué, officials at the G-20 warned that trade tensions have “intensified” and agreed to address..."
"FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday described “very active efforts” by Russia to interfere in the 2020 election, primarily by working to damage former Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Wray said Russians have been using social media, as well as “proxies, state media, online journals"" and other vehicles to hurt Biden and what it views as anti-Russian factions in U.S. politics.
Wray’s assessment affirms the findings of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which last month described Russia’s efforts to damage Biden and specifically identified..."
"In accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden decisively debunked the accusation by President Trump that he is “sleepy” or mentally impaired. His speech may not have been soaring oratory, but it was a self-assured and sobering address. It combined a withering indictment of the man he referred to disdainfully as “the current occupant of the White House” with a promise to “choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.”
Biden’s overarching emphasis was on the urgency of replacing a president who has “cloaked America in darkness for..."
"Last week, which was 84 years ago, we wrote the pandemic-gripped world is like that kid on the long car ride asking “Are we there yet?” The analogy was off by just a bit, at least in the U.S.: Here, that impatient kid is actually driving the car.
President Donald Trump has obviously been itching to end lockdowns, and yesterday he released guidelines on how states could do it. These were surprisingly deferential to governors, but that didn’t last long. This morning he was on Twitter, calling on Minnesota, Michigan..."
"EXPECTATIONS ARE running high that reopening the United States will mean returning to offices, factories and schools, kick-starting the economy and rediscovering life before the novel coronavirus pandemic. At best these alluring goals are likely to be achieved haltingly, partially, more slowly than we would like — and how haltingly will depend heavily on how well the nation undertakes a mammoth set of public health tasks.
The inescapable fact is that in the absence of a vaccine or drug therapy for the next year or more, a highly infectious virus..."
"Expanded unemployment benefits that have kept millions of Americans afloat during the pandemic expired on Monday, setting up an abrupt cutoff of assistance to 7.5 million people as the Delta variant rattles the pandemic recovery.
The end of the aid came without objection from President Biden and his top economic advisers, who have become caught in a political fight over the benefits and are now banking on other federal help and an autumn pickup in hiring to keep vulnerable families from foreclosure and food lines.
The $1.9 trillion economic aid package..."
"The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review Oklahoma's method of execution by lethal injection, taking up a case brought by three death row inmates who accuse the state of violating the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
The high court just last week allowed the execution of a convicted killer to go ahead in Oklahoma over the objection of its four liberal members.
The three-drug process used by Oklahoma prison officials for carrying out the death penalty has been widely debated since the April 2014 botched execution..."

"The Senate’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare collapsed early Friday morning, and President Trump has already replied that he is ready to “let Obamacare implode” and then reopen negotiations.
Absent some kind of legislation, what is going to happen to the Affordable Care Act? Here's what the death of ""repeal and replace"" could mean for you."
"With the simple stroke of a pen, President Biden has the unique opportunity to unlock financial freedom for countless Black Americans and low-income communities. But according to CNN reporting, he might cancel just $10,000 of student loan debt per borrower for those earning less than $125,000 a year. That would do little to help.
Black Americans have been disproportionately devastated by student loan debt. Four years after graduating, they hold an average of almost $53,000 in debt, almost double the $28,000 average White Americans hold. And they typically end up owing 6% more than..."
"The Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution to ratify membership for Sweden and Finland in NATO, a historic vote aimed at strengthening the defense bloc amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
NATO formalized its invitation to Sweden and Finland to join the alliance at the end of June and the decision must go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification.
President Joe Biden sent the protocols for ratification to the Senate in July, paving the way for the vote, which needed to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate..."
"President Joe Biden plans to release 15 million barrels of oil or more from the U.S. strategic reserves in an effort to stop gasoline prices from rising now that OPEC and its allies plan to cut production.
The administration hopes that tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move that comes just weeks before the midterm elections, will bring relief to voters who have been struggling from high gasoline prices.
Global oil prices were rising even before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. When Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports..."
"The impromptu celebrations for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris after the marathon presidential election could very well have harmed the new president’s goal of taming the coronavirus pandemic, Bay Area epidemiologists said.
Corks popped in the Bay Area and across the nation after the two ended President Trump’s four-year reign, but it was pretty clear from television crowd shots that social distancing was not foremost on the minds of the shouting, chanting, singing revelers, some of whom even snuck in hugs and kisses.

"Senator Ted Cruz on Friday accused Donald J. Trump “and his henchmen” of peddling an article in a supermarket tabloid alleging that Mr. Cruz had engaged in extramarital affairs.
Mr. Cruz called the report, published by The National Enquirer, a piece of “garbage,” replete with “utter lies.” He said that “the truth does not matter” to Mr. Trump.
“He will lie and go to sleaze,” Mr. Cruz told reporters after a campaign stop in Wisconsin. “Well"
"President Joe Biden said he remains hopeful that the U.S. and China can work together during a Monday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
""The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges from climate change to food insecurity and for us to be able to work together,"" Biden told Xi. ""The United States stands ready to do just that – work with you – if that's what you desire.”
The meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies is happening on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit,..."
"President Trump has admitted to intentional voter suppression. The Post reports, “President Trump said Thursday that he does not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are seeking to expand mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic, making explicit the reason he has declined to approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the cash-strapped agency.” There is no nuance, no joke. Republicans are firmly opposing free and fair elections — unless they do something about this.
Trump and Republicans have been successful in imposing a raft of measures designed..."
"Emily Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, said the transition between President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden can begin, releasing millions of dollars in funds and clearing the way for a new administration.
“I have dedicated much of my adult life to public service, and I have always strived to do what is right,” Murphy wrote in a letter to Biden on Monday. “Please know that I came to my decision independently, based on the law and the available facts. I was never directly or indirectly pressured..."
"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is asking Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the former president, to appear for a voluntary deposition to answer questions about Donald Trump’s efforts to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory.
The move by the panel marks an aggressive new phase in its inquiry into the 6 January insurrection, as House investigators seek for the first time testimony from a member of the Trump family about potential criminality on the part of the former president.
Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the..."
"Twice in the final months of the Trump administration, the country’s top military officer was so fearful that the president’s actions might spark a war with China that he moved urgently to avert armed conflict.
In a pair of secret phone calls, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, assured his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army, that the United States would not strike, according to a new book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward and national political reporter Robert..."
"Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, announced Saturday night that he was ending his cable talk show and would make a decision about a presidential bid this spring.
Mr. Huckabee, a Republican, used his weekly Fox News program, “Huckabee,” to reveal that he was leaving the network as he considers a second campaign for the White House.
“As much as I have loved doing the show, I cannot bring myself to rule out another presidential run,” said Mr. Huckabee, 59, who also sought the Republican nomination in 2008. Adding..."
"The protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, want justice for the unarmed black teenager shot and killed there by a police officer. But the protests also reflect broader patterns of racial injustice across the country, from chronic police violence and abuse against black men to the persistent economic and social exclusion of communities of color."
"First Washington, D.C., then New York City. Now Chicago. 
Officials from Texas and Arizona have been sending busloads of asylum seekers to those cities to the east for months. On Wednesday, Chicago joined New York and Washington when the first busloads of migrants from Texas arrived there. 
""President Biden's inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans --- and Americans -- at risk and is overwhelming our communities,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement late Wednesday. ""To continue providing much-needed relief to our small, overrun border towns, Chicago will join fellow..."
"President Trump will propose $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade in his budget for fiscal year 2021 — a document that is expected to be quickly dismissed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
The proposal, set for release at 12:30 p.m. ET on Monday, will include slashing foreign aid by 21%, budget chief Russell Vought told NPR's Steve Inskeep.
The White House wants to boost funding for the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation while cutting other types of foreign aid, said Vought, the acting head of the..."
"President Trump’s budget previews the economic pitch he will be making to voters: more deficit spending to compensate for extended tax cuts and pay for everything from his border wall to boosted NASA funding. All while avoiding painful cuts to Social Security and Medicare benefits.
The document, out today, abandons Trump’s 2016 campaign pledge to eliminate the national debt by the end of a second term — as well as the less-ambitious plan in his first budget to close the gap between federal revenue and spending by 2028.

"John McAfee, the creator of McAfee antivirus software, was found dead in his jail cell near Barcelona in an apparent suicide Wednesday, hours after a Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States to face tax charges punishable by decades in prison, authorities said.
The eccentric cryptocurrency promoter and tax opponent whose history of legal troubles spanned from Tennessee to Central America to the Caribbean was discovered at the Brians 2 penitentiary in northeastern Spain. Security personnel tried to revive him, but the jail’s medical team finally certified his..."
"The antivirus software entrepreneur John McAfee has been found dead in his cell in Spain from an apparent suicide, hours after the country’s highest court approved his extradition to the United States, where he was wanted on tax-related criminal charges that carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.
Catalan’s regional police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, confirmed a report in El País that McAfee, 75, had been found dead in the Brians 2 prison near Barcelona, late on Wednesday.
In a statement, the Catalan justice department said that prison officers and medics had tried..."
"A California man accused of flying across the country with plans to break into Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s home to assassinate him was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury, officials said.
The single count of attempting to kill a U.S. judge added new details about what authorities say Nicholas Roske, 26, had with him when he arrived via taxi cab to the conservative justice’s home just after 1 a.m. in Chevy Chase, Md., last week.
In addition to a gun, burglary tools and a pair of boots with..."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon is set to sign his much-hyped executive order on campus free speech — which he has vowed will require colleges to ""support free speech"" or face ""very costly"" penalties.
But the order essentially just reinforces what schools are already supposed to be doing by formally requiring colleges to agree to promote free inquiry in order to get billions of dollars in federal research funding.
""While many schools — or all schools — are frankly supposed to follow this currently, it will ensure that grant..."
"More than 1 million people have died from the coronavirus worldwide, marking another milestone in the pandemic's brief but devastating history.
The death toll from the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, now stands at 1,000,555, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The grim tally has been reached in less than nine months since the first death caused by the coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities in the city of Wuhan.
Since then, the virus has disrupted the everyday lives of billions of people around the globe and caused..."
"Joginder Chaudhary was his parents’ greatest pride, raised with the little they earned farming a half-acre plot in central India to become the first doctor from their village.
For the coronavirus, though, he was just one more in a million.
After the virus killed the 27-year-old Chaudhary in late July, his mother wept inconsolably. With her son gone, Premlata Chaudhary said, how could she go on living? Three weeks later, on Aug. 18, the virus took her life, too — yet another number in an unrelenting march toward a woeful..."
"Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has formally announced his bid for House speaker, saying he would ""bridge the divide"" between establishment and conservative Republicans better than House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

"The judge presiding over the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse on Thursday banned MSNBC employees from the courthouse, saying someone who identified himself as a producer for the network was caught following a bus carrying jurors.
Judge Bruce Schroeder made the announcement in court on Thursday as the jury deliberated for a third day over whether Rittenhouse, 18, is guilty of felony charges in the shooting deaths of two people and wounding of another during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse claims self-defense.
The judge said a man named James Morrison..."

"European Union leaders on Thursday agreed to extend the deadline for Britain’s looming exit from the bloc in order to give Prime Minister Theresa May and the British Parliament more time to get their act together.
Thursday’s agreement effectively averted the possibility of a disorderly and possibly chaotic departure by Britain on March 29. Yet that still remains a possibility just a few weeks later.
After hours of difficult and sometimes passionate talks, the leaders decided that Britain’s exit date will be pushed back to May 22 if next week..."
"In April, there was only a 91 percent chance that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) would run for president of the United States. Now, he's 100 percent ready.
On Monday morning, the longtime hopeful officially announced his 2016 presidential run in his hometown of Central, South Carolina, in front of his family's restaurant and pool hall.
""I'm Lindsey Graham and I'm running for president of the United States,"" he said during the campaign launch -- and, as he added later in the announcement, he is ""ready to be commander in chief..."
"Lindsey Graham is running for president because, he says, ""the world is falling apart.""
And if Americans are looking for a commander-in-chief, the South Carolina senator believes he's it.
Graham, who told CNN last month he's been ""more right than wrong on foreign policy,"" announced his presidential bid in his hometown of Central, South Carolina, on Monday. He hopes that his track record on foreign affairs will give him the advantage in a wide-open primary fight."
"Kneeling in the dirt in a desert somewhere in the Middle East, James Foley lost his life this week at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Before pulling out the knife used to decapitate him, his masked executioner explained that he was killing the 40-year-old American journalist in retaliation for the recent United States’ airstrikes against the terrorist group in Iraq."
"Navy Secretary Richard Spencer resigned Sunday at Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s request over a private compromise Spencer proposed to the White House that would have allowed a sailor accused of war crimes to retire as a SEAL rather than being kicked out of the elite force’s ranks, the Pentagon said.
Spencer‘s departure marks the latest development in a case that has pitted military leaders against President Donald Trump, whose desire to keep the sailor in the SEALs Spencer criticized in a letter to the president. It also adds to a..."
"When House Republicans meet Wednesday, they'll be at odds over what to do about Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene, controversial figures representing the two wings of an increasingly fractured party.
But the closed-door gathering also could reveal a lot more about the direction of a party openly warring with itself while charting a future without Donald Trump in the White House but very much on GOP voters' minds.
Denver Riggleman, a former Virginia GOP congressman who lost reelection last year to a more conservative Republican, told USA TODAY Tuesday..."
"House Republicans will meet Wednesday afternoon to address simmering intraparty tensions after former President Donald Trump's second impeachment, with debate expected around Rep. Liz Cheney's impeachment vote and the controversy ignited by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's history of espousing conspiracy theories.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., met with Greene Tuesday night over her committee assignments, and even convened the GOP Steering Committee - which assigns committee seats - to discuss the issue, though no final decision about Greene's situation was made.
Cheney, the chair of the conference and a..."
"Just days after the Trump administration set out careful benchmarks for states to meet before reopening their economies, four governors announced plans that basically ignore them.
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp will allow many businesses to reopen on Friday. In South Carolina, some retailers and its beaches are already open. The governors of Tennessee and Ohio will begin phased restarts on May 1. Yet all of these states have seen Covid-19 case counts, day over day, jump within the past few days. The White House guidelines call for two weeks of..."
"The mounting death toll in Ukraine has forced President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider concessions to Russia in order to bring an end to the devastating conflict, but the specific elements of any peace deal his government may be discussing with Moscow remain a mystery to Western leaders, said U.S. and European officials.
The secretive rounds of meetings between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators could hold the key to ending the conflict but also carry broader implications for European security depending on how the warring parties settle their differences. If Russian President..."
"Federal prosecutors on Thursday indicted one-time presidential aide Steve Bannon and three others on charges of taking money donated to help build a wall along the southern border, authorities said.
Bannon, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato, Timothy Shea ""and others orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors,"" according to prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.
The defendants' online crowdfunding campaign “We Build The Wall” raised more than $25 million, with Kolfage ""repeatedly and falsely assured the public that he would 'not..."
"Time and again — when President Trump stood by Saudi Arabia after the killing of a Virginia-based journalist, when it looked as if he might intervene in the special counsel’s Russia investigation and when he threatened to declare a national emergency to pay for his border wall — lawmakers on Capitol Hill warned him not to push them too far."
"Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel blasted the Commission on Presidential Debates in a letter on Tuesday over its handling of the 2020 debates and threatened to advise future GOP candidates against participating in the organization's events. 
""The CPD's repeated missteps and the partisan actions of its Board Members make clear that the organization no longer provides the fair and impartial forum for presidential debates which the law requires and the American people deserve,"" McDaniel wrote."
"The White House is pushing back against the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump by refusing to cooperate with lawmakers’ demands for documents and interviews related to the investigation, setting up a constitutional crisis.
The eight-page letter, signed Tuesday by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, also accused Democratic lawmakers of using the investigation to overturn the 2016 election results and demanded they abandon all impeachment efforts.
The administration’s letter ― which consisted more of the president’s political attacks than substantive legal arguments ― alleged that Democrats have denied Trump..."
"A top official at the Department of Veterans Affairs has resigned amid the growing scandal about wait times and care at veterans' hospitals, the department's leader said Friday.
News about the resignation of Dr. Robert Petzel, undersecretary for health in the Department of Veterans Affairs, came one day after he spoke at a Senate hearing about the issue alongside Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki."
"Eric Shinseki has served his country honorably as a twice-wounded officer in Vietnam, as Army chief of staff and finally as President Obama’s secretary of veterans affairs.
But his maddeningly passive response to the scandal roiling his agency suggests that the best way Shinseki can serve now is to step aside."
"In the hours after a gunman killed more than 20 people at a South Texas elementary school Tuesday, the state’s top Republicans sought to immediately squelch the possibility of gun control measures in the wake of yet another mass shooting.
As the death toll mounted from the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde and President Joe Biden vowed to push for stricter gun laws, Texas Republicans made it clear that any kind of gun restriction in response to the tragedy was off the table."
"St. Louis Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced Monday night that a grand jury declined to indict officer Darren Wilson, 28, for firing six shots in an August confrontation that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown. Here are the latest developments:
Wilson speaks publicly for the first time: Officer Darren Wilson will speaking with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on World News Tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET. It will be the first time he has spoken publicly since the shooting on Aug. 9."
"Americans are still deeply divided over the shooting of teenager Michael Brown this summer by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken before a grand jury decision not to indict Wilson was released Monday night.
While 28 percent said Wilson was at fault and should be punished, 23 percent said he was fully justified in the shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old, and another 30 percent said both Wilson and Brown made mistakes and it was ""just a tragic accident."" Another 20 percent were undecided."
"The International Swimming Federation (FINA) has voted to approve a new policy that will restrict most transgender athletes from competing in elite women’s aquatics competitions.
Swimming’s world governing body approved the new “gender inclusion” policy on Sunday, after 71.5% of FINA’s member federations voted in support at the FINA Extraordinary General Congress 2022.
The new gender inclusion policy, which is set to go into effect on June 20, 2022, says that male-to-female transgender athletes will only be eligible to compete in the women’s categories in FINA competitions if they transition..."
"President Biden’s fiscal 2023 budget will call for additional military spending in the face of Russian aggression toward Ukraine, domestic funding for child care and police departments along with new taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
The proposal, which will be released on Monday, could be the last salvo of Mr. Biden’s legislative agenda, as Democrats face the prospect of losing control of Congress in what are expected to be bruising midterm elections.
Mr. Biden plans to ask Congress to help his administration tackle some of the biggest concerns facing voters, including..."
"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying.
Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd’s death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor’s full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate...."
"The Minneapolis police statement was short and sanitized. An allegation of forgery. A suspect who “appeared to be under the influence,” who “physically resisted officers” and who appeared to be “suffering medical distress.”
The video that emerged hours later told a drastically different story. It showed a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black suspect until he appeared limp and unconscious. Throughout the encounter, the man, George Floyd, could be heard saying “I can’t breathe” again and again. He later died at a hospital.
The..."
"Senators Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, have had a contentious few weeks on the campaign trail sparring over policy positions from immigration to government surveillance in an effort to break out in a crowded GOP primary field and solidify their own support for the Republican nomination."
"On November 10, three days into his trial, Kyle Rittenhouse took the witness stand in his own defense on murder charges stemming from his killing two men and wounding another with an assault weapon during the civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in the wake of the 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake. During his testimony, Rittenhouse was overcome with emotion. Wracked with sobs, he was unable to continue speaking. Whether you believe they were crocodile tears or a legitimate expression of remorse and horror, Rittenhouse’s breakdown marked a turning point in his..."
"A bipartisan coalition in the Senate easily passed legislation on Monday to force Internet retailers to collect sales taxes for state and local governments, sending the issue to the House, where antitax forces have vowed to kill it. But the 69-to-27 vote in the Senate will give the measure significant momentum."
"The economy produced another strong month of growth, and the jobless rate fell to the lowest level of the recovery.
The Labor Department released the April data on hiring and unemployment on Friday morning, providing an up-to-the-minute snapshot of the economy.
263,000 jobs were created last month. Analysts had expected a gain of 190,000 jobs, according to Bloomberg.
The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, the lowest in half a century. The rate was 3.8 percent in March.
Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2 percent, which follows an increase of 0.1..."
"There is a tendency among the punditocracy to dismiss President Trump's authoritarian rhetoric as nothing more than red meat for his worshipful base: passing Twitter tantrums or hyperbolic salesmanship. He's been doing it from the moment he announced his run for president, when he insulted Latino immigrants as rapists. It continued through the campaign as he endorsed torture, summary executions and banning Muslims from the country."
"Analysis: The report found an FBI process so rife with errors that the bureau's director immediately issued a statement saying he would begin reforms.
Given the unsupported claims President Donald Trump has made for two years about the FBI's Russia investigation — calling it a witch hunt cooked up by his political opponents — the conclusion by the Justice Department watchdog that the probe was justified was big news.
But the other major findings of the inspector general's report — that there were serious problems with the way the FBI..."
"President Trump has gone full bipartisan.
Matching calls from both sides of the aisle, Trump announced Monday that he would soon authorize sanctions ""against current and former officials"" in Turkey and ""any persons contributing to Turkey's destabilizing actions in northeast Syria,"" as well as other tariffs against the country. The move comes after the U.S. withdrew troops from the Kurdish-held area and Turkey quickly invaded.
Trump's promised executive order includes an increase on steel tariffs back to 50 percent, ""the level prior to reduction in May,"" a Monday statement from..."
"President Trump announced Monday that he would “soon” issue an executive order to authorize sanctions against the highest levels of the Turkish government, as the situation on the ground in northern Syria continued to deteriorate Monday following the recent withdrawal of U.S. forces in the region.
Trump did not specify when the sanctions would be leveled against Turkey, but said in a statement that the executive order would empower the U.S. government to impose additional penalties against “those who may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a cease-fire,..."
"Right-wing talk show host Alex Jones will have to pay the parents of a Sandy Hook shooting victim a little more than $4 million in compensatory damages, a jury decided Thursday, capping a stunning and dramatic case that showcased for the public the real-world harm inflicted by viral conspiracy theories.
The award from the jury was far less than what the plaintiffs, Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, had asked for. At the start of the trial, attorneys for Lewis and Heslin asked the jury to award their clients $150 million in compensatory..."
"Former President Donald Trump could return to Facebook on Jan. 7, 2023.
Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, announced Friday that the company has cut short its “indefinite” ban on Trump, which was imposed after he used the platform to spread baseless claims of election fraud and incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. 
In its place, Facebook has implemented a conditional two-year ban.
Should Facebook determine Trump fit to return to the platform at the end of that ban, he’d be back just in time for..."
"Russian authorities said Sunday they had opened a murder investigation after the daughter of influential, ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin was killed by a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow.
The Russian Investigative Committee said it believed someone planned and ordered the car explosion that killed Darya Dugina, based on evidence already collected from the blast. ""Taking into account the data already obtained, the investigation believes that the crime was pre-planned and was of an ordered nature,"" the investigative committee said in a statement Sunday.
Dugina died at the scene after..."
"The National Rifle Association said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy and is moving to Texas, where the organization says it has 400,000 members. The NRA is currently based out of New York, where state Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit alleging financial crimes by its top officials and seeking to disband the organization.
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection stops all court and legal proceedings regarding debt or collection, while an organization restructures its debts. In May 2020, the NRA, which says it has 5 million members, laid..."
"The House of Representatives approved decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level on Friday in the first time Congress has acted on the issue.
The vote was largely along party lines – 228-164. Five Republicans and the lone independent member joined Democrats to pass the bill, and six Democrats voted no.
Branded as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, or MORE Act, the bill removes cannabis from the list of federally controlled substances and facilitates canceling low-level federal convictions and arrests related to marijuana.
The legislation is not expected to..."
"The House of Representatives has approved legislation that would decriminalize marijuana and seek to ""address the devastating injustices caused by the War on Drugs.""
Friday's vote in the Democratic-led House is the first time a chamber of Congress has voted on federal marijuana decriminalization. It has little chance of passing the Republican-led Senate, however.
The bill passed largely along party lines: 222 Democrats, five Republicans and Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian, voted in support while 158 Republicans and six Democrats voted against.
The Republicans who voted for the bill are..."
"In Thursday's biggest development, nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers -- led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida -- barged into a deposition and demanded they be allowed to see the closed-door proceedings. Members of three committees planned to interview Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper as part of the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump. It delayed Cooper's testimony by hours.
The chaotic scene, with Republicans flouting House rules to make a political point, represented a new and more confrontational phase of the GOP attack on House Intelligence Chairman Adam..."
"A new wave of anger swept through Uvalde on Tuesday over surveillance footage of police officers in body armor milling in the hallway of Robb Elementary School while a gunman carried out a massacre inside a fourth-grade classroom where 19 children and two teachers were killed.
The video published Tuesday by the Austin American-Statesman is a disturbing 80-minute recording of what has been known for weeks now about one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history: that heavily armed police officers, some armed with rifles and bulletproof shields, massed in the..."
"The gunman walks into Robb Elementary School unimpeded, moments after spraying bullets from his semi-automatic rifle outside the building and after desperate calls to 911 from inside and outside the Uvalde school.
He slows down to peek around a corner in the hallway and flips back his hair before proceeding toward classrooms 111 and 112.
Seconds later, a boy with neatly combed hair and glasses exits the bathroom to head back to his class. As he begins to turn the corner, he notices the gunman standing by the classroom door and then firing..."
"The United States is now in what disaster-preparedness experts once modeled as a worst-case scenario. We are flooded with a highly transmissible virus that causes unpredictable symptoms: sometimes mild, sometimes fatal. The curve is not flat, or even a curve. It’s almost a line that points straight upward. More than 1,000 Americans are dying every day, on average. Soon that number will likely hit 2,000.
In this precarious moment, many Americans are planning to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by traveling and having dinner with 10 or more people. Pandemic models..."
"Attendees of Travis Scott’s Astroworld music festival sued the rapper and the event’s organizer, Live Nation, on Sunday, in what are expected to be the first of many lawsuits after a tragic crowd crush left at least eight people dead and scores injured on Friday night.
Manuel Souza filed a case just days after the incident, claiming the festival “failed to properly plan and conduct the concert in a safe manner.” The suit names Scott, Live Nation and other co-organizers, calling the deaths a “preventable tragedy.” Souza is demanding at least $1..."
"Of all the shortages created by the coronavirus pandemic -- the toilet paper and the hand sanitizer and the bottled water -- the oddest of them all has to be dogs. Oh, and cats too.
That’s right, in the New York city area, the epicenter of the disease, there is suddenly a run on pets. At least of the adopted or fostered kind. Muddy Paws Rescue and Best Friends Animal Society are reporting shelters they work with are either all out of or almost out of cats and dogs after..."
"The coronavirus pandemic has left many without jobs, making it difficult to pay for rent.
Thankfully, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, who own a couple of residential buildings in Los Angeles, are taking notice of this and are waiving tenants' rent fees for April.
TMZ reported that Dax's sister, who is the manager of Kristen and Dax's company Pringus Property LLC, emailed tenants over the weekend to let them know the great news and ""promised to work with residents going forward as best as possible.""
This news comes after many..."
"When the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released a new report estimating the effects of a higher minimum wage, conservatives pounced on the possibility that a minimum wage hike to $10.10 would cost about 500,000 jobs. But much like their reaction to the recent report about the Affordable Care Act, they are jumping to conclusions far too quickly.
First, there are reasons to be skeptical about the negative employment effect. Many studies find no negative employment effects. A recent report by Demos finds that by stimulating economic growth, a minimum..."
"After coming under criticism from the head of a Jewish organization after he used the word ""Shylocks"" in a speech, Vice President Biden acknowledged making a ""poor"" word choice.
In a statement responding to Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman, Biden said Foxman was right to express his disapproval.
""Abe Foxman has been a friend and advisor of mine for a long time. He's correct, it was a poor choice of words, particularly as he said coming from 'someone as friendl"
"Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. rental market was in trouble. In 2017, economist Andrew Dumont calculated that 46.8% of U.S. renter households spent more than 30% of their income on housing. Poorer households, unsurprisingly, were even more heavily burdened; in 2015, the lowest-income quintile spent more than half of their income on rent.
Then came the pandemic. Although federal relief managed to support many unemployed workers and distressed businesses, many people fell through the cracks, failing to qualify for special unemployment benefits or bailout funds. And many Americans..."
"In Columbus, Ohio, judges have relocated eviction hearings to the cavernous halls of the city’s convention center, to ensure there’s plenty of space for the grim business of throwing families onto the street.
In New Orleans, piles of personal belongings on sidewalks — “eviction cairns,” in the haunting phrase of Sue Mobley, a member of the city’s planning commission — are an increasingly common sight.
In Savannah, Ga., the county sheriff, John Wilcher, announced at the start of the month that he would begin moving forward with about 500 pending..."
"When President Obamas aides said they werent familiar with former Missouri steelworker Joe Soptics life story, all they had to do was check their own campaign archives. Soptic, laid off from Bain Capital-owned GST Steel, stars in a Priorities USA Action spot this week in which he tells of how his wife died without health insurance after he lost his job. Soptic also appeared, wearing what appears to be an identical shirt, in a May television ad for the Obama campaign."
"A divided Supreme Court has ended a national moratorium on evictions in parts of the country ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, removing protections for millions of Americans who have not been able to make rent payments.
A coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups in Alabama and Georgia challenged the latest extension of a moratorium imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued Aug. 3 and intended to run through Oct. 3.
In an unsigned opinion released Thursday night, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority agreed that the federal..."
"Top lawmakers announced a deal on Thursday to keep the government funded through mid-February, but a group of Senate Republicans was still threatening to force a shutdown over the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for large employers.
With less than 48 hours before funding is set to lapse, the House was expected to vote later Thursday to keep the government open through Feb. 18 and provide $7 billion for the care and resettlement of Afghan refugees. But the fate of the measure was uncertain in the Senate, where unanimity would be needed to expedite its..."
"Four states are poised to cancel their 2020 GOP presidential primaries and caucuses, a move that would cut off oxygen to Donald Trump’s long-shot primary challengers.
Republican parties in South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas are expected to finalize the cancellations in meetings this weekend, according to three GOP officials who are familiar with the plans."
"In a letter to new FBI Director James Comey, several Republican members of Congress called the Obama administration’s investigation of the 2012 Benghazi attack “unacceptable” and encouraged an “aggressive” investigation.
“It has been more than 10 months since the attacks,” a copy of the letter, obtained by POLITICO, states. “We appear to be no closer to knowing who was responsible today than we were in the early weeks following the attack. This is simply unacceptable.”

"In normal times, for most Americans, Memorial Day conjures up the start of summer — beach and lake trips, barbecues, pool time, warm weather. Many don’t even stop to think about the purpose of the holiday. And those who do sometimes confuse Memorial Day with other holidays honoring veterans. But, with covid-19 leaving many Americans stuck at home or unable to enjoy these usual holiday celebrations, 2020 might be an opportunity to recall that Memorial Day is actually intended to be a day to remember those who died while serving..."
"Under fire from congressional critics, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice stressed in a Tuesday statement that she did not intend to mislead the public about the September 11th attacks on the Benghazi consulate.
""Neither I nor anyone else in the administration intended to mislead the American people at any stage in this process, and the administration updated Congress and the American people as our assessments evolved,"" Rice said."
"Washington (CNN) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Republican lawmakers said Tuesday their meeting with Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the acting CIA director left them with more unanswered questions about her remarks following the September 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.
Speaking to reporters after the morning meeting, Sen. John McCain said he and fellow Republicans Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Lindsey Graham were ""significantly troubled"" by many of the answers they received from Rice, who asked for the meeting with..."
"Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits surged last week, topping estimates with the highest level since September, suggesting that widening business shutdowns to curb the pandemic are spurring fresh job losses.
Initial jobless claims in regular state programs rose by 137,000 to 853,000 in the week ended Dec. 5, Labor Department data showed Thursday. On an unadjusted basis, the figure increased by almost 229,000. The prior week included Thanksgiving, and data tend to be volatile around holidays.
Continuing claims, the number of Americans on ongoing unemployment benefits, jumped by 230,000 to..."
"A federal judge granted a temporary reprieve Sunday to TikTok, the short-form video app that was facing a Trump administration-imposed midnight deadline that would have prevented users from downloading it.
The order from U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols of Washington, D.C., allows U.S. app stores to continue offering downloads. Nichols did not rule on a second, more comprehensive ban that would halt U.S. companies from working with TikTok.
In a statement, TikTok said that it was pleased with the ruling and that it ""will continue defending our rights for the..."
"The Cal State East Bay student and Chinese national hobnobbed with some of the Bay Area’s leading politicians, even fundraising for some. She attended student events, fundraisers, campaign rallies and cocktail parties throughout the region, ingratiating herself to politicians on the rise.
But what Congressman Eric Swalwell and others didn’t know was Christine Fang, or Fang Fang, was a suspected Chinese spy, according to a one-year investigation by Axios. U.S. intelligence officials told the news organization that China’s main civilian spy agency ran an operation developing connections with local and..."
The woman who has accused Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault decades ago wants the FBI to investigate her allegation before she testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee — a demand that came as President Trump and Senate Republicans increasingly rallied to the defense of the embattled Supreme Court nominee.
"Nearly 12 years ago, Barack Obama began staffing his administration in the middle of a global economic crisis. Despite the high hopes of the progressive forces that catapulted Obama into office, his transition set the tone for a presidency that would be steered by corporate insiders.
In one notorious example, Citigroup continued to pay a top executive, Michael Froman, while he served on the board of Obama's transition team, playing a key role in filling the administration with Wall Street insiders, whose firms were seeking government support amid the financial..."
"In 2016, Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton on July 12, two weeks before the start of the Democratic convention. This year, Sanders endorsed Joe Biden on April 13, offering much more time for the party to achieve the unity it needs to prevail in November.
As befits the moment, they did it over a joint livestream.
“Today, I am asking all Americans, I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every Independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,” said..."
"Stumping for a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will otherwise hit at year's end, President Barack Obama on Friday toured a Pennsylvania toy factory that's churning out would-be holiday gifts, warning of a ""Scrooge"" Christmas if Congress does not pass legislation extending tax cuts for 98% of Americans."
"Nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers could be extended past Tuesday's deadline for the outline of an agreement if enough progress is made to justify it, the White House said.
Tuesday's statement by White House press secretary Josh Earnest suggested that talks meant to produce an outline that would allow the sides to continue negotiations until the June 30 final deadline had not bridged all gaps — but that the sides were working to produce a text with few specifics, accompanied by documents outlining areas where further talks..."
"Deal or no deal in the Iranian nuclear talks, Tehran is already behaving like it's made a killing.
Sure, U.S. and international sanctions inflicted staggering damage on Iran's economy, convincing the longtime American foe to join talks aimed at limiting its nuclear program. Those talks face an important Tuesday night deadline.
But it's not just Iran's nuclear aspirations that have everyone's attention -- though just the fact that Iranian officials are at the table with the world's most powerful countries has elevated Iran's international status."
"Elon Musk says that Twitter is in “clear material breach” of their $44 billion acquisition deal and that he could “terminate” the agreement in response. In a letter sent to Twitter this morning, Musk’s legal team claims that Twitter has failed to provide him with information on the service’s spam bot problem and that he’s entitled to receive that information under the deal agreement.
“Mr. Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights (and the company’s corresponding obligations) under the merger agreement,” the lawyers write. The letter says..."
"The battle for Ukraine unfolding before our eyes has the potential to be the most transformational event in Europe since World War II and the most dangerous confrontation for the world since the Cuban missile crisis. I see three possible scenarios for how this story ends. I call them “the full-blown disaster,” “the dirty compromise” and “salvation.”"
"Michigan Rep. Justin Amash said Thursday that he's leaving the Republican party to become an independent as modern politics remains ""trapped in a partisan death spiral.""
Penning an op-ed in the Washington Post on the July 4th holiday, Amash described how he had become ""disenchanted with party politics"" and ""frightened by what I see from it.""
""The two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions,"" Amash wrote.
Amash was the only GOP member of Congress to have come out in favor of impeaching President Donald..."
"Rep. Justin Amash is celebrating this Fourth of July in a manner years in the making: by declaring his independence from the Republican Party.
“No matter your circumstance, I’m asking you to join me in rejecting the partisan loyalties and rhetoric that divide and dehumanize us,” Amash wrote in a Washington Post op-ed﻿ posted Thursday morning. “I’m asking you to believe that we can do better than this two-party system — and to work toward it. If we continue to take America for granted, we will lose it.”
Amash, perhaps..."
"One suspect is dead after a shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, but two others may be on the loose, the D.C. police chief said Monday.
""The big concern for us right now is that we potentially have two other shooters that we have not located at this point,"" Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters.
Multiple people were killed in the shooting rampage, Lanier said, which sent police in SWAT team gear swarming to the scene Monday morning.
Hours later, Lanier said authorities were still looking..."
"Speaking hours after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, President Barack Obama called the incident a ""cowardly act"" that would be swiftly and ""thoroughly"" investigated.
""We still don’t know all the facts, but we do know that several people have been shot and some have been killed,"" he said. ""So we are confronting yet another mass shooting and today it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital."""
"President Joe Biden named acting Federal Communications Commissioner Chair Jessica Rosenworcel to officially head the agency on Tuesday, propping her up as the administration’s leader to tackle broadband expansion and net neutrality. Biden also nominated progressive advocate Gigi Sohn as the third Democrat for the bench.
The decision comes late into Biden’s term, beating out both former presidents Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon who nominated their FCC chairs well into September of their first years. If confirmed by the Senate before December, the FCC’s 2-2 deadlock would end and provide Democrats with..."
"A weird thing happened right after the Nov. 3 election: nothing.
The nation was braced for chaos. Liberal groups had vowed to take to the streets, planning hundreds of protests across the country. Right-wing militias were girding for battle. In a poll before Election Day, 75% of Americans voiced concern about violence.
Instead, an eerie quiet descended. As President Trump refused to concede, the response was not mass action but crickets. When media organizations called the race for Joe Biden on Nov. 7, jubilation broke out instead, as people thronged..."
"The U.S. said Monday it will ease airline restrictions this fall on travel to the country for people who have vaccination proof and a negative COVID-19 test, replacing a hodgepodge of rules that had kept out many non-citizens and irritated allies in Europe and beyond where virus cases are far lower.
The changes, to take effect in November, will allow families and others who have been separated by the travel restrictions for 18 months to plan for long-awaited reunifications and allow foreigners with work permits to get back to their..."
"The Biden administration will require all international travelers coming into the United States to be fully vaccinated and tested for Covid-19 under a new system that will open up air travel to vaccinated foreign nationals from dozens of countries for the first time since the early days of the pandemic.
Starting in early November, foreign nationals will be allowed to fly into the U.S. if they are fully vaccinated and able to show proof of vaccination prior to boarding a U.S.-bound flight, White House Covid coordinator Jeffrey Zients said.
The requirement will..."
"In a digital ad push that begins Friday morning, Hillary Clinton’s aides are indulging a hypothetical that campaigns often avoid: the possibility that the opposition could win.
The ad, which an aide said is being promoted on social media and through paid digital advertising, imagines the cable news headlines of a future under President Donald Trump."
"The Special Olympics reversed its Covid-19 vaccine mandate for upcoming competitions in Orlando after Florida threatened event organizers with a $27.5 million fine over the requirement.
The Special Olympics issued a statement on Friday saying it will lift its mandate as directed by state officials on May 27 “based upon the Florida Department of Health’s interpretation of Florida law.”"
"A second cease-fire announced by Mariupol City Council to allow civilians to escape through a designated safe route out of the city fell apart when Russian troops began ""heavy shelling."" 
""The evacuation convoy with the local population could not leave Mariupol today: the Russians began regrouping their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to take people out in such conditions,"" a statement on the Telegram channel read. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross, aiding the proposed evacuation from Mariupol in southern Ukraine, also tweeted to..."
"On a wild day on Wall Street, stocks ended the day higher with a stunning turnaround just before the closing bell. Stocks began the day with a dramatic selloff.
US stocks opened in the red as investors worried about the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates, tensions in Ukraine, earnings season and — of course — inflation.
At the low point of the session, the market was on track for its worst day since October 2020, with the Dow down more than 1,000 points.
But with just minutes to go in the trading..."
"The Intercept, a journalism website funded by eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar and run by investigative journalists Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill, produced an important scoop Monday.
Its article, drawn from a classified National Security Agency document the Intercept said it received anonymously, exposed “a months-long Russian intelligence cyber effort against elements of the U.S. election and voting infrastructure.” Absent the website’s publication, we might never have learned about the Russian attack aimed at a U.S. vendor of voter registration systems."
"America's sprawling elections infrastructure has been called ""a hairball"" — but as people in Silicon Valley might ask, is that a feature or a bug? Then-FBI Director James Comey touted it as a good thing — ""the beauty of our system,"" he told Congress, is that the ""hairball"" is too vast, unconnected and woolly to be hacked from the outside.
That was before Monday's leak of a top secret National Security Agency report about a Russian election cyberattack. What that document confirms is that if the whole is safe, its..."
"The United States could default on its debt sometime in October if Congress does not take action to raise or suspend the debt limit, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned on Wednesday.
The “extraordinary measures” that the Treasury Department has been employing to finance the government on a temporary basis since Aug. 1 will be exhausted next month, Ms. Yellen said in a letter to lawmakers. She added that the exact timing remained unclear but that time to avert an economic catastrophe was running out."
"The National Archives, which contains some of the country's founding documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, apologized for blurring parts of an image from the 2017 Women's March critical of President Donald Trump.
""We apologize, and will immediately start a thorough review of our exhibit policies and procedures so that this does not happen again,"" the National Archives Twitter account wrote."
"Last month, a photographer named Ellen Shub died, near Boston, at the age of seventy-three. I had got to know Shub in the nineteen-eighties, when I worked for gay and lesbian publications. At that time, she was already well known as a chronicler of social protest—a role that she continued to perform up until she unexpectedly fell ill, just weeks before she died. Many of her pictures were compositionally similar—frontal, focussed on one person and one sign. In 1975, she took a picture of a woman holding a placard that..."
"Former special counsel Robert Mueller opened his hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday by noting it was unusual that he was testifying at all — and trying to head off lawmakers from asking questions he won’t be able to answer.
“It is unusual for a prosecutor to testify about a criminal investigation, and given my role as a prosecutor, there are reasons why my testimony will necessarily be limited,” he said.
Mueller is set to appear before two congressional committees on Wednesday to discuss the results of his..."
"Congressional leaders on Friday failed to secure a long-awaited deal on a $900 billion pandemic relief package but managed to narrowly avoid a government shutdown -- for now.
The House and Senate passed a two-day extension of government funding to keep agencies operating until Sunday night. The stop-gap bill now goes to President Donald Trump for his signature.
The move ratcheted up pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finalize a stimulus agreement that they have said for days they are on the cusp..."
"In an interview released Sunday morning, Mr. Obama acknowledged that getting his package of gun proposals through Congress could be tough, and he expressed empathy for the strong sentiments of gun owners. Like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has mentioned that he owns two shotguns, Mr. Obama tried to associate himself with those who enjoy firing guns."
"Eight people were killed in shootings at three businesses in the Atlanta area on Tuesday. Six of the eight victims were Asian women, authorities say.
The attacks began at around 5 pm Tuesday afternoon. Atlanta police officers first responded to a crime scene at Young’s Asian Massage, where four people were killed, in Cherokee County, just north of Atlanta. The victims were Delaina Ashley Yuan, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Yan, and Daoyou Feng. A fifth person, Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
About 45 minutes later, four more people were..."
"A white gunman accused of killing eight people, most of them of Asian descent, at three Atlanta-area massage parlors claimed to have a “sex addiction” and apparently lashed out at what he saw as sources of temptation, officials said Wednesday.
The bloodshed immediately raised fears of another hate crime against Asian Americans. But Robert Aaron Long, 21, told police the attack was not racially motivated, and police said it appeared it may not have been. Six of the victims were identified as Asian and seven were women.
The attack was..."
"HONG KONG — Protesters clashed with police in riot gear and armed with pepper spray in Hong Kong's main airport terminal on Tuesday, leaving at least one person injured.
Video showed officers attempting to clear out the crowd at Hong Kong International Airport as the protesters chanted. Not long after the intense altercation began, most of the protesters had left the airport and police had pulled back.
Several demonstrators were arrested during the violent confrontation. The Hong Police Force said in a tweet that at least one person was injured..."
"The nation's public schools have no general power to punish students for what they say off campus, the Supreme Court said Wednesday.
The 8-1 ruling broadened First Amendment protections in an era when school children are in nearly constant contact with one another through social media and text messages. The decision did not protect all off-campus expression, but the court suggested that the exceptions, to be worked out in future cases, would be limited.
""The leeway the First Amendment grants to schools,"" in light of the special characteristics of off-campus expression, ""is..."
"Walmart will stop selling handguns and certain types of ammunition, and will no longer allow customers to openly carry firearms, after separate shootings at company stores last month left at least 24 people dead.

The world’s largest retailer says it will stop selling ammunition for handguns and short-barrel rifles — including .223..."
"President Joe Biden on Monday signed an executive order repealing the ban on transgender people serving openly in the military, a ban that former President Donald Trump had put in effect, the White House said.
In a statement, the White House said Biden's order ""sets the policy that all Americans who are qualified to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States should be able to serve."""
"Democratic presidential candidate and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker introduced a sweeping gun violence prevention plan. If elected, the campaign announced Monday that on day one of his presidency, Booker will use executive action to close gun sales loopholes and to make investments in communities affected by gun violence.
The plan, which is the most extensive gun violence prevention proposal put forth by a presidential candidate to date, prioritizes a gun licensing program whereby gun owners would be required to obtain a gun permit and pass an FBI background check...."
"Conservative media turned 2021’s National Read Across America Day into an epic culture war meltdown.
On Tuesday morning and into the afternoon, programming on Fox News and Fox Business ceaselessly harped upon the purported “cancellation” of legendary children’s author Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, as the latest example of woke liberalism run amok — conveniently ignoring the fact that Dr. Seuss has not, in fact, been canceled.
“The cancel culture is canceling Dr. Seuss,” lamented Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade, adding later, “It’s out of control.”
“People..."
"The Consumer Price Index -- a measure of inflation in the economy -- hit a four-decade high in March, a brutal reminder for Democrats of the political headwinds facing them as they seek to keep their majorities in the House and Senate this fall.
Prices rose 8.5% from March 2021 to March 2022, while they increased 1.2% from February to March. Half of the increase in the CPI was due to rising gas prices in March.
The Biden administration had been expecting a bad CPI number. ""We expect March CPI..."
"The inflation report for March came in hot, as expected: Consumer prices are up 8.5 percent over the past year. But more than two years into the pandemic, we’re still living on Covid time, where things can change very fast — so fast that official data, even about the recent past, can give a misleading picture of what’s happening now.
In this case, the Consumer Price Index — which roughly speaking measures average prices over the month — probably missed a downward turn that began in late March and is accelerating as you read..."
"President Trump proposed legislation on Thursday that would provide a path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants in exchange for an end to decades of family-based migration policies, a costly border wall and a vast crackdown on other immigrants living in the country illegally."
"The House has begun a historic day of debate that is expected to end with votes to impeach President Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine, making him only the third president in U.S. history to receive that sanction.
Based on public announcements, Democrats have enough votes to approve articles of impeachment against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Wednesday’s action will lead to a trial in the Republican-led Senate, where a two-thirds vote would be required to remove the president from office.
At the heart of the..."
"President Joe Biden has made a long-awaited decision on how to handle student debt. On Aug. 24 Biden announced that his administration will waive student loan debt for qualifying Americans — $10,000 for individuals earning less than $125,000, plus an additional $10,000 for those who had received Pell Grants, which support tuition for lower-income students.
But can Biden make his plan stick? 
On that question, the jury is out.
Legal experts say the Biden administration’s legal rationale for waiving student debt may not hold up in court. But it’s unclear..."
"Recreational marijuana could be legal in half the country if the handful of states with cannabis measures on ballots this November pass them.
Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota have measures on their ballots this fall for voters to consider legalizing recreational marijuana. They would join 19 states and the District of Columbia with recreational cannabis.
A decade since Colorado and Washington approved recreational cannabis, prohibitions have fallen across the country: in big, populous states like California and New York and smaller rural ones like Maine and Vermont. States in..."
"Voters in four states have approved ballot measures that will change their state constitutions to prohibit slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment for crime, while those in a fifth state rejected a flawed version on the question.
The measures approved Tuesday could curtail the use of prison labor in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont.
In Louisiana, a former slave-holding state and one of a handful that sentences convicted felons to hard labor, lawmakers trying to get rid of forced prisoner labor ended up torpedoing their own measure. They told voters to..."
"Former US Rep. TJ Cox, a Democrat from California, has been indicted on federal money laundering and wire fraud charges related in part to campaign donations, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday.
Cox pleaded not guilty in federal court on Tuesday afternoon, following his arrest hours before at the Fresno County federal courthouse, according to online records from the county Sheriff's Office. He is charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, one count of financial institution fraud and one count of campaign contribution fraud, according..."
"President Biden announced Thursday the U.S. will provide another round of security assistance to Ukraine worth roughly $800 million, as the war with Russia enters in next phrase with Russian forces continuing their large-scale offensive to take control of Ukraine's east.
The equipment will ""further augment Ukraine's ability to fight in the east in the Donbas region,"" the president told reporters. The Defense Department said the package includes 72 155mm howitzers, 144,000 artillery rounds, 72 tactical vehicles to tow the howitzers and 121 unmanned aerial drone systems.

"NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- U.S. retail sales rose for the first time in four months in July, an encouraging sign that the economy may have started strengthening in the middle of the summer.
Overall retail sales rose 0.8% in the month, according to a Commerce Department report released Tuesday. The increase was well above economists' expectations for growth of 0.2%."
"Job growth in July beat expectations but unemployment ticked upward, the Labor Department reported Friday, handing Mitt Romney and the Obama administration a statistic of choice as they spar over the state of the economy.
The economy added 163,000 jobs in July while unemployment ticked up slightly to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent, the Labor Department reported on Friday.

"A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a mostly facetious article about six events that could occur to flip the polls in favor of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and then I assessed how much each would matter. No single occurrence, apart from the preposterously unlikely event of Barack Obama endorsing Trump, seemed to have a ton of power on its own. Non-silly scenarios included the release of new and questionable Clinton e-mails, a month of passable behavior from Trump, and a serious health setback for Clinton."
"Donald Trump's reversal on the ""birther"" controversy is turning attention -- at least for the moment -- from a major shift in the presidential race.
The battle for the White House -- dominated by Hillary Clinton only weeks ago -- is tightening dramatically, a nerve-wracking turn for Democrats that sets up what could be a nail-biter election in 52 days."
"By letting the House take up the Senate's fiscal cliff-dodging legislation that raises income tax rates on the wealthiest earners, Speaker John Boehner answered affirmatively a question that had been on many minds: Would he allow an up-or-down floor vote on a bill opposed by most fellow House Republicans?"
"As protests against racism and police violence swept across the country, drawing massive crowds into the streets amid a pandemic, public health officials worried about what the overall impact would be.
Would these protests — which many health leaders said they support — also turn out to be virus super-spreading events?
But a new study by a nationwide research team that includes a University of Colorado Denver professor has found something surprising: The protests may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations, including Denver...."
"Double-masking — specifically, wearing a surgical mask underneath a cloth mask — may provide an extremely high level of protection against the viral particles that cause Covid-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday.
A year into the pandemic, the report is the first from the CDC that breaks down how well certain mask-wearing techniques work to protect wearers and those around them.
""We know that masks work,"" said Dr. John Brooks, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC and co-author of the new report. ""This is about how..."

More than 743,000 workers filed new claims for state benefits last week, before adjusting for seasonal factors, an increase of 18,000 from the week before. With seasonal swings factored in, the latest figure was 742,000, also an increase from the previous week, the Labor Department said."
"Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, was one of President Donald J. Trump’s most vocal allies during his term, publicly pledging loyalty and even signing a letter nominating the president for the Nobel Peace Prize.
In the final weeks of Mr. Trump’s term, Mr. Gaetz sought something in return. He privately asked the White House for blanket pre-emptive pardons for himself and unidentified congressional allies for any crimes they may have committed, according to two people told of the discussions."
"Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz sought blanket pre-emptive pardons for himself and others in Congress during the final days of former President Donald Trump's term, according to reports from the New York Times and Fox News.
Gaetz, an ardent Trump ally during the former president's four years in office, asked Trump aides in January for the president to offer pardons for any given crimes, two Trump associates with knowledge of the request told the Times.
The report comes amid an ongoing scandal for the representative, who is under federal criminal investigation..."

"President Joe Biden on Saturday was criticized by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic antagonist and ally, for being “cavalier” and “divorced from reality” after vowing to shutter coal-fired power plants and rely more heavily on wind and solar energy in the future.
The powerful coal-state lawmaker said Biden’s words “ignore the severe economic pain” for people from higher energy prices and are why Americans “are losing trust” in Biden. Manchin’s stinging rebuke of his party’s leader comes at precarious time for Democrats on the final weekend of campaigning..."
"The Biden administration and House and Senate Democrats want to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour. The result would be straightforward: higher wages, but also the closure of mom-and-pop stores; higher prices on everything from gas-station tacos to day care; a rise in unemployment, particularly among teenagers; and strain in low-wage, rural economies.
That, at least, is the argument being made by many economists, businesses, lobbying groups, and conservative politicians as the proposal comes under congressional consideration. It is an intuitive one. Democrats..."

In addition to the known deaths, the weekend's..."
"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan Thursday morning to discuss major policy differences. The gap between the men is so wide that Ryan, who represents conservatives still skeptical of Trump, announced last week he was withholding support for Trump until the rift could be mended."
"The astonishment in Denmark over President Trump’s apparent desire to buy Greenland turned to bewilderment and anger on Wednesday after the American leader abruptly scrapped a state visit because the Danes have no desire to sell.
The cancellation was a rare snub of Denmark’s head of state, Queen Margrethe II, who had extended the invitation to the president and would have hosted him and the first lady.
News that Mr. Trump had called off his visit “came as a surprise,” the Royal House’s communications director told the state broadcaster, adding,..."

Fifty-two out of the 53-member GOP caucus voted in favor of moving forward on the proposal, a win for Senate Republican leadership after weeks of internal division. But 60 votes were needed for the bill to advance, and no Senate Democrats voted for the measure, dismissing it as a political stunt."

The bill was defeated in a 52-47 vote, not meeting the 60 needed to break the Democratic filibuster, a mechanism requiring three-fifths of the chamber to agree to end the debate and allow a final vote. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted with Democrats in opposing the bill.
After the chamber failed to move forward, senators voiced skepticism..."
"One of the Russian Navy's most important warships has been badly damaged in the Black Sea, a massive blow to a military struggling against Ukrainian resistance 50 days into Vladimir Putin's invasion of his neighbor.
Russian sailors evacuated the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, after a fire that detonated ammunition aboard, Russia's defense ministry said.
Ukraine's Operational Command South claimed Thursday that the Moskva had begun to sink after it was hit Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles.

"Since international troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan in May, the Taliban have carried out a sweeping military campaign and gained control of much of the country’s rural areas. But for months, the insurgents failed to capture major cities — until now.
Over the past six days, the insurgents have overrun nine provincial capitals across the country, most of them clustered in the north, in a major escalation of their military offensive and a devastating setback for the Afghan government.
The Taliban’s rapid victories have put enormous pressure on Afghan political leaders and the country’s..."
"It was a surprise, even for a journalist, to be driving down Wellington Street, the city's ceremonial thoroughfare, and to find myself swept into the chaotic aftermath of a disaster. I was rushing to a television studio at mid-morning and passing by the National War Memorial, just minutes after the shooting. A solider was down."
"The House of Representatives on Friday passed two measures to restore abortion rights after the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.

"We're not with her. That's what Democratic voters in West Virginia said Tuesday night, with Hillary Clinton losing to Bernie Sanders. Although the loss was not unexpected, Clinton's campaign sure seems like one long slog of speeches, handshakes and voter selfies on the way toward the 2016 convention in Philadelphia."
"President Joe Biden’s administration has reopened a tent facility to house up to 700 immigrant teenagers after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied by a parent, a sign of growing worries about how children are treated in government custody.
U.S. Health and Human Services said Monday that the first teens arrived at Carrizo Springs, Texas, which was converted two years ago into a holding facility under former President Donald Trump. The facility has been closed since July 2019.
Two years ago, Carrizo Springs had a large tent serving as a..."
"For as long as former president Donald Trump’s highly controversial policies on children at the U.S.-Mexico border have been at issue, there have been allegations of hypocrisy leveled against critics of those policies. Democrats accused Trump of putting “kids in cages,” so Trump and his defenders pointed out that the chain-link partitions were built by the Obama administration. Democrats decried the separation of children from their families, so Trump defenders pointed out this happened sometimes under Barack Obama, too.
Both of those allegations of hypocrisy were vastly oversimplified. As The..."
"A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday dealt a significant blow to the Affordable Care Act, when it threw out an IRS regulation that governs subsidies. But before the ink dried on that decision, another three-judge panel hearing a similar case issued a decision that was completely opposite.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice said..."
"Two federal appeals court panels issued conflicting rulings Tuesday on whether the government could subsidize health insurance premiums for millions of Americans, raising yet more questions about the future of the health care law four years after it was signed by President Obama.
The contradictory rulings will apparently have no immediate impact on consumers. But they could inject uncertainty, confusion and turmoil into health insurance markets as the administration firms up plans for another open enrollment season starting in November."
"Fox News capped off election season 2012 by ignoring President Obama's late-night campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa -- his last as a candidate -- to rerun an earlier broadcast of Bill O'Reilly's show. The decision to not cover Obama's last speech was not surprising considering the network has treated its airtime as an extension of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's communications efforts.
On Monday, the day before Election Day, Fox covered every single Romney speech save the last for a total airtime of 59 minutes. Fox News even kicked..."

The transactions, some of which involved Mr. Trump’s now-defunct foundation, set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect illicit activity, according to five current and former bank employees. Compliance staff members who then reviewed the transactions prepared so-called suspicious activity reports that they believed should be sent to a unit of the Treasury Department that..."

"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Voters in Wisconsin will likely face a choice on Tuesday of participating in a presidential primary election or heeding warnings from public health officials to stay away from large crowds during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Monday ordered the election back on, hours after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued an executive order postponing it for two months. That was part of a last-ditch effort by Evers to stop in-person voting on Tuesday out of concerns about putting poll workers and voters at risk..."
"Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the governor could not postpone Tuesday’s elections because of concerns about the coronavirus, a decision that throws into chaos a presidential primary and nearly 4,000 local contests.
The court ruled 4-2, along ideological lines, that Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, could not use emergency powers to unilaterally change the date of the election, which he sought to do to circumvent Republican opposition to the move.
Mr. Evers had previously said he lacked the legal authority to delay the election and had called upon..."

"A polarizing debate is happening around the nation as lawmakers in eight states have introduced bills in recent weeks seeking to restrict transition-related treatment for transgender youth.
Proponents say the measures protect minors from medical changes they may regret as adults, while opponents say the bills prevent doctors from following health care guidelines approved by organizations such as the American Medical Association.
The South Dakota House passed its version of the bill last week, which would impose a one-year jail sentence and a maximum fine of $2,000 on doctors..."
"Early in my medical training, I read a landmark case study about a 12-year-old boy who wrote a suicide note to his mother saying he would rather die than go through puberty. I later met teenagers who tightly bound their chests — knowing that it could result in fractured ribs — because the emotional pain of seeing their breasts was much worse than any imaginable physical pain.
These children are transgender, and they account for almost 2 percent of youth in the United States. They are suffering from the psychological..."

"Roughly 2.1 million Americans lost their jobs last week, according to Labor Department data. In this economy, that qualifies as good news.
Yes, 2.1 million initial unemployment claims is an awful lot of initial unemployment claims. But it is also a smaller number of claims than were filed the previous week. In fact, the number of Americans applying for first-time jobless benefits has now declined for eight straight weeks. More significantly, the number of Americans who just joined the unemployment roles is smaller than the number who just left them:..."

The comments come hours after The Washington Post reported..."
"A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Thursday there is “little optimism” about ending Russia’s confrontation with United States and NATO over Ukraine after the allies rejected Moscow’s key demands, but he opened the path for further high-level talks.
Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Putin has studied the proposals and will respond quickly — raising the prospect of further dialogue, even as more Western military aid arrives in Ukraine amid fears that Russia could attack at any time.
The handover of the U.S. and NATO proposals is an important development in the..."
"A record number of children in the US are hospitalized with COVID-19, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The US averaged 672 new hospital admissions per day for the 0-17 age group in the week of December 27 and January 2, shattering the previous record of around 340 admissions per day during a period in early September 2021.
Children, however, are the least likely age bracket to get hospitalized by the virus, according to the data.  
The 0-17 age group has seen a rate..."
"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned on Friday that pediatric hospitals are seeing record numbers of children with COVID-19, as the Omicron variant surges nationwide.
US coronavirus cases are currently higher than they’ve ever been, averaging around 600,000 new cases reported daily (itself an undercount), with hospitalization rates that have increased for people of all ages, according to Walensky, who briefed reporters on Friday. More than 1,200 people a day are dying of COVID-19 nationwide.
“While children still have the lowest rate of hospitalization of any group, pediatric hospitalizations are at the highest rate compared..."
"With the Supreme Court signaling a willingness to reverse decades-old precedents like the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on Thursday that he would seek to overturn a 1982 court decision that obligated public schools to educate all children, including undocumented immigrants.
Mr. Abbott’s comments opened a new front in his campaign to use his powers as governor to harden Texas against unauthorized migration. And they demonstrated just how expansively some conservatives are thinking when it comes to the kinds of changes to American life..."
"A House committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection is moving swiftly Tuesday to hold at least one of Donald Trump’s allies in contempt as the former president is pushing back on the probe in a new lawsuit.
Trump is aggressively trying to block the committee’s work by directing former White House aide Steve Bannon not to answer questions in the probe while also suing the panel to try to prevent Congress from obtaining former White House documents. But lawmakers on the House committee say they will not back down as they..."
"The battle between the financial establishment and small individual investors is heating up, and the situation is already becoming political — in some cases providing some interesting common ground.
The anger is bipartisan. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), Rep Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and even Donald Trump Jr., eldest son of the former president, have all called out the situation as unfair for individual investors.
As Robinhood and other brokerages halted buying of Gamestop (GME), AMC (AMC) and other stocks Thursday, only allowing users to..."
"Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto will win reelection in Nevada, CNN projects, clinching a critical victory that will allow Democrats to keep control of the US Senate.
Cortez Masto had long been viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fended off a challenge from former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt in a state whose economy had been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and inflation.
With Cortez Masto – the first Latina senator – securing a second term, Democrats will hold 50 seats and Republicans will..."
"The Derek Chauvin verdict has been nearly a year in the making. Footage of the murder of George Floyd last May has been viewed by millions worldwide, sparking ongoing international protests against police brutality and igniting policy changes to reform and reimagine the role of police. Though the amount of video footage of the killing was unprecedented and the momentum for justice was undeniable, history did not necessarily point to an easy conviction.
The former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty of all three charges — second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree..."
"The White House is intensifying a pressure campaign against the oil industry over rebounding gas prices as it tries to contain the political fallout of rising fuel costs just ahead of the midterms.
Top Biden administration officials in recent weeks have publicly warned companies against inflating prices. In private, their message has been even more direct. They’ve aired complaints to executives over their ballooning profits and threatened drastic new restrictions — such as limits on companies’ fuel exports — if the industry refuses to help ease the price at the..."
"China on Monday announced unspecified sanctions against 11 U.S. politicians and heads of organizations promoting democratic causes, including Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have already been singled out by Beijing.
Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Monday said the 11 had “performed badly” on issues concerning Hong Kong, where China has cracked down on opposition voices following its imposition of a national security law in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city last month.
The number of Americans named by the ministry exactly equals the number of Hong Kong and..."
"China said on Monday it has imposed sanctions on 11 Americans, including six US lawmakers, for ""behaving badly on Hong Kong-related issues.""
The action is the latest in escalating tensions between the two countries and a back-and forth in sanctions. The US on Friday sanctioned Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as well as 10 other Chinese and Hong Kong officials for their role in crackdowns on political freedom in the region -- the latest measure taken by the Trump administration in response to China's imposition of a controversial national..."
"Daniel Goldman, lawyer for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, said President Trump's behavior is ""a clear and present danger"" to future US elections.
""President Trump's persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,"" he said.
Goldman is still giving his opening statement, but he'll come back to the idea of ""clear and present danger,"" according to a copy of his prepared remarks.

"With the coronavirus surging out of control, the nation’s top public health agency pleaded with Americans on Thursday not to travel for Thanksgiving and not to spend the holiday with people from outside their household.
The Thanksgiving warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came as the White House coronavirus task force held a briefing for the first time in months and Vice President Mike Pence concluded it without responding to questions by reporters or urging Americans not to travel.
Other members of the task force — whose..."
"Americans should avoid travel for Thanksgiving, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Thursday.
It was a last-minute attempt by the nation's leading public health agency to curb what's sure to be yet another dangerous spike in Covid-19 cases if families gather next week.
""In the last week, we've seen over a million new cases,"" Erin Sauber-Schatz, head of the CDC's Community Interventions and Critical Populations Task Force, said Thursday on a call with reporters. ""Thanksgiving is a week away.""
Still, the CDC stopped short of mandating that Americans..."
"United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has notified the US Congress that the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China.
Wednesday's notification to lawmakers sets the stage for the US to withdraw preferential trade and financial status that the former British colony has enjoyed since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.
""Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as US laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement."
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China – a landmark decision that will likely escalate already strained U.S.-China relations and which could have serious economic consequences for the global financial hub.
""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Pompeo's decision was sparked by the Chinese government's move to assert sweeping authority over Hong Kong and comes as tensions between the Trump..."
"The US economy shrank again in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday.
Gross domestic product, a wide-ranging measure of economic activity, fell by 0.9% on an annualized basis from April through June. That decline marks a key symbolic threshold for the most commonly used — albeit unofficial — definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth.
The hotly anticipated data release has taken on outsized significance as investors, policymakers and ordinary Americans seek some measure of clarity in the current muddled economic..."
"The White House on Monday released the report of the presidential 1776 Commission, a sweeping attack on liberal thought and activism that calls for a “patriotic education,” defends America’s founding against charges that it was tainted by slavery and likens progressivism to fascism.
President Trump formed the 18-member commission — which includes no professional historians but a number of conservative activists, politicians and intellectuals — in the heat of his re-election campaign in September, as he cast himself as a defender of traditional American heritage against “radical” liberals. Not previously..."
"A president who has survived one revelation after another the last three years now faces perhaps the most serious disclosure of his political career at the very moment he is on trial in the Senate.
In another time, in another Washington, this might be the moment that changed the trajectory of the presidency. A former national security adviser confirms that the president, despite his denials, conditioned security aid to a war-torn ally on its cooperation against his domestic rivals, the issue at the heart of his ongoing impeachment trial.
At..."
"An explosive leak from former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s unpublished book that says President Donald Trump wanted to freeze aid to Ukraine until its government investigated his political rival threatens to scramble the politics of the impeachment trial and bring new pressure on Republicans to call witnesses.
Bolton’s account in the draft of his book, as described by the New York Times, fortifies the two central arguments made by Democrats in the trial: that Trump used the power of his office for political gain and that the senators urgently..."
"Apologies from Iranian leaders over the downing of an airliner last week have done little to quell mass anti-government protests spreading across the country.
Thousands of demonstrators hit the streets this weekend condemning Iranian authorities for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane and killing all 176 people on board.
The airliner disaster came hours after Iran fired missiles at Iraqi military bases housing US troops. That was retaliation for a drone strike at Baghdad airport that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.
Amid rising tensions in the region, eight Katyusha rockets..."
"Apprehensions of undocumented migrants crossing the southern U.S. border passed 1.7 million in fiscal year 2021 to hit an all-time high, according to Customs and Border Protection data obtained by NBC News, as U.S. officials turn their attention to a huge new caravan of migrants in southern Mexico that may head north as soon as this weekend.
The caravan gathered in Tapachula, near the Mexico-Guatemala border, includes thousands of migrants fleeing Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba and other Latin American countries, two Department of Homeland Security officials said. Violent clashes with Mexican police..."
"Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday he will propose bipartisan legislation to encourage more states to adopt “red flag” laws following a pair of horrific mass shootings.
The South Carolina Republican’s announcement came soon after President Donald Trump also called for such laws, which allow police and family members to request that a court temporarily restrict access to firearms to people who may pose an imminent threat to themselves or others."
"President Biden's joint address to Congress looked back over the challenges he faced taking office 100 days ago in the midst of a pandemic — and declared ""America is on the move again."" But the speech also outlined an ambitious, active role for the government to continue helping Americans struggling, as well as new proposals to boost the country's ability to compete. It amounted to an updated New Deal, but one that faces a precarious path to get through razor-thin margins in both the House and Senate.
Because of the..."
"With his vow to spend money on blue-collar jobs and tax the rich, Biden’s program aims to splinter the Trump Coalition.
President Joe Biden’s address to a joint session Congress was the most ambitious ideological statement made by any Democratic president in decades—couched in language that made it sound as if he wasn’t making an ideological argument at all.
Make no mistake that he was. He called for trillions in new spending in a robust expansion of government’s role in multiple arenas of American life in ways that would have..."
"President Barack Obama checked off his pledge to visit all 50 states while in office with a commencement address at a South Dakota community college that he called a model for preparing young Americans for the modern workforce.
“I believe that in a fast-paced, hyper-connected, constantly changing world, there are few institutions that are more important to America’s economic future than community colleges,” Obama told students at nationally-recognized Lake Area Technical Institute in Watertown, South Dakota. “We should have faith in people like you. We should invest in people like..."
"Federal law allows students who were defrauded by their colleges into taking out federal student loans to have their debts forgiven. The Obama administration has said repeatedly it will ensure aggrieved borrowers get this form of relief, a commitment that Education Undersecretary Ted Mitchell reiterated this week following the bankruptcy filing of troubled for-profit school operator Corinthian Colleges Inc.
But that’"
"President Joe Biden launched a new crime prevention strategy Wednesday in a push to take on soaring gun violence as Republicans blame a rise in crime on calls from progressive activists to cut police funding. 
In a speech from the White House, Biden announced a ""zero-tolerance policy"" for rogue gun dealers and a new focus by the Justice Department to try to stop the illegal sale of firearms.
Biden also emphasized that cities and states can use their portions of $350 billion in direct aid from Biden's COVID-19 rescue plan, approved by Congress in March, on public safety efforts, including hiring..."
"President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced a comprehensive strategy on violent crime prevention -- with a particular emphasis on gun crimes -- amid a nationwide surge in violent crime that's emerged as an area of concern for the White House.
Following his meeting with state and local leaders to discuss the spike in crime, Biden addressed the issue in a speech at the White House.
""Crime historically rises during the summer and as we emerge from this pandemic with the country opening back up again, the traditional summer spike may be..."
"Republican Dan Sullivan was victorious over incumbent Democrat Mark Begich in the Alaska Senate race. The Associated Press announced the decision early Wednesday, more than a week after the midterms were held.
Sullivan served as the Attorney General of Alaska under former Gov. Sarah Palin (R). Begich previously served as the mayor of Anchorage before being elected to the Senate in 2008."
"Republican Dan Sullivan won Alaska's U.S. Senate race, defeating incumbent Democrat Mark Begich.
Sullivan led Begich by about 8,100 votes on election night last week, and when state officials counted absentee and questioned ballots Tuesday, the results indicated that Begich could not overcome Sullivan's lead.
The Alaska seat was initially considered key to the Republicans' hopes of taking control of the U.S. Senate, but that was accomplished election night with the GOP sweep.
Sullivan, a first-time candidate, ran a confident campaign, ignoring the debate schedule Begich released during the primary..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a landmark civil rights law protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination, handing the movement for L.G.B.T. equality a stunning victory.
The vote was 6 to 3, with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch writing the majority opinion. He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.
The case concerned Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employment discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and sex...."
"A divided Supreme Court further advanced the cause of LGBTQ rights Monday, ruling that a landmark civil rights law barring sex discrimination in the workplace applies to gay, lesbian and transgender workers.
The decision was written by Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's first nominee to the cour. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's four liberal justices. Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or..."
"President Biden announced Monday that 90% of all American adults will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, about two weeks before May 1, the date he has set to have enough doses for all adults. But Mr. Biden on Monday also warned Americans should not ""let up now"" amid rising COVID-19 infection increases and called on governors who have lifted mask mandates to reinstate them.
""If we let our guard down now, we could still see the virus getting worse, not better,"" Mr. Biden said Monday...."
"As the coronavirus pandemic engulfed the world last spring, Science magazine quoted a top Chinese health official saying that the United States and other Western nations were making a “big mistake” by not telling people to mask up.
The official, George Gao, worried that the comment might upset his longtime friend Anthony S. Fauci, Washington’s leading expert on infectious diseases. So amid the deepening crisis, Gao reached out to clear the air.
“I saw the Science interview, how could I say such a word ‘big mistake’ about others? That was journalist’s..."
"It became apparent today that GOP leaders, who were caught off guard by defections of their members Monday night, lacked the votes to abolish parts of the 2010 law outright. Three centrist Republican senators — Susan Collins (Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — all said they would oppose any vote to proceed with an immediate repeal of the law."
"The Senate appears on track to prevent a government shutdown on Thursday at midnight, as Democrats and Republicans wade through last-minute impediments to a stopgap funding bill’s speedy passage.
Senators were close to finalizing an agreement on Wednesday evening that would tee up final passage of the short-term funding package on Thursday, just hours before federal cash expires, according to a source. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a fiscal hawk notorious for blocking spending bills, also indicated that he wouldn’t object to quickly passing the continuing resolution, which would keep the..."
"President Joe Biden enters the most seismic week of his legislative agenda explicitly set to miss one deadline and implicitly knowing he'll soon have to bow to a Republican blockade on another.
Feverish talks over the course of the weekend led to a rhetorical intraparty pressure release, but still left Democrats miles away from a clear pathway forward on their sweeping $4 trillion dual-pronged agenda, according to multiple people directly involved.
Every piece of Biden's agenda is on the line this week. The vote on his $1.2 trillion Senate-passed infrastructure bill has..."
"Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that he had fired his national security adviser John Bolton, in what is the latest indication of unrest and tension inside the president’s national security team.
“I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,” the president tweeted. “I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will..."
"BEIJING — President Trump imposed tariffs in July on $34 billion in Chinese goods. China matched them dollar for dollar with its own.
Then he hit an additional $16 billion in goods in August. China matched that, too.
Now, Mr. Trump has made his biggest move yet, announcing 10 percent tariffs starting in a week on $200 billion a year of Chinese goods. But this time, China can’t match them all — and that crystallizes a growing problem for Beijing."
"Ukraine's bid to join the European Union received a major boost on Friday morning, after the bloc's executive said it believed the country should be formally considered for candidate status in the wake of Russia's invasion.
Speaking in Brussels, the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission recommends ""that Ukraine is given candidate status. This is of course on the understanding that the country will carry out a number of further reforms.""
""In the view of the Commission, Ukraine has clearly demonstrated the country's aspiration and the country's determination to..."
"The Obama administration on Wednesday declassified opinions from a secret court that oversees government surveillance showing the National Security Agency was broadly collecting domestic Internet communications of Americans and misrepresenting the scope of that effort to the court.
The three opinions include one from October 2011 by U.S. District Judge John Bates, who scolded government lawyers that the NSA had, for the third time in less than three years, belatedly acknowledged it was collecting more data than it was legally allowed to."
"A federal judge sharply rebuked the National Security Agency in 2011 for repeatedly misleading the court that oversees its surveillance on domestic soil, including a program that is collecting tens of thousands of domestic e-mails and other Internet communications of Americans each year, according to a secret ruling made public on Wednesday."
"The coronavirus is no longer just a slow-moving public health crisis that may soon turn into a rapid-moving one. It’s a crisis of transparency. It’s a crisis of government legitimacy. So it is in this spirit that we all have to say: enough.
Whose side is the Trump administration on? Based on every public appearance we’ve seen so far — whether it’s from a cabinet member or the director of the Centers for Disease Control or the president himself — the answer is clear: not the public’s. President Trump, hellbent..."
"The Trump administration is once again trying to force social media platforms to do its bidding. This time, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been tapped to use a law called Section 230 to prevent websites from moderating content in a way that many conservatives believe is biased against them. Despite the law being designed to prevent FCC intervention — and the FCC itself using that as justification not to regulate the internet just a few years ago — it appears the agency is going to try.
This comes after..."
"Former President Donald Trump pushed back on a questioner's skepticism about the effectiveness and safety of the Covid-19 vaccine in a new interview, saying that the ""vaccine works"" and ""people aren't dying when they take the vaccine.""
""Look, the results of the vaccine are very good, and if you do get (Covid), it's a very minor form. People aren't dying when they take the vaccine,"" he said in an interview with The Daily Wire's Candace Owens that was released Tuesday.
When Owens began raising doubt about the vaccine efficacy, Trump interjected,..."
"Former President Donald Trump hailed the COVID-19 vaccine and pushed back on vaccine skepticism in a new interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens.
Trump called the vaccine ""one of the greatest achievements of mankind"" and praised his administration's success in getting the vaccine developed on his watch.
Typically, vaccine development takes years, but the Trump administration pumped billions of dollars into Operation Warp Speed to help produce a vaccine ready at record speed. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the Moderna and BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines for emergency use in December 2020. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine was authorized for..."
"It's all about Paul Ryan right now. House Republicans are frantically lobbying Ryan to run for speaker after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly ditched his bid Thursday for speaker, leaving a gaping hole atop the fractious Republican Conference and no obvious successor to John Boehner."
"Applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance rose slightly for the first time since late April, likely a temporary blip for a labor market that’s otherwise improving as the economy reopens.
Initial claims in regular state programs increased by 37,000 to 412,000 in the week ended June 12, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 360,000 applications.
The jump in claims was concentrated in three states -- Pennsylvania, California and Kentucky. Even with the increase, layoffs have declined significantly in recent months as..."
"Each Saturday morning in July and August, Susan E. Rice, President Obama’s new national security adviser, gathered half a dozen aides in her corner office in the White House to plot America’s future in the Middle East. The policy review, a kind of midcourse correction, has set the United States on a new heading in the world’s most turbulent region."
"President Trump is threatening to veto the omnibus spending bill the Senate passed overnight — despite indicating support for it in the last two days — because he says it doesn't protect Dreamers or fully fund his border wall. The president's veto threat suddenly makes a government shutdown, which seemed to be a crisis averted early Friday morning, much more likely."
"George W. Bush says that he badly wants his brother Jeb to run for president -- and that if he were to face off against Hillary Clinton, he would ""absolutely"" beat her in a 2016 matchup.
""He knows I want him to run,"" the former president told Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""If I need to reiterate it, I will: Run, Jeb. I think he'd be a great president.""
Asked if he considered Clinton to be ""formidable,"" Bush said, ""Very much so. No question. So is..."
"A new poll released Monday indicates Hillary Clinton holds an advantage over five potential Republican opponents in hypothetical match-ups for the 2016 presidential election.
Clinton, however, fails to break past the 50% line when matched against each of the possible Republican contenders, according to the Bloomberg Politics Poll.
If the contest were held today, 45% of likely voters say they would pick the former secretary of state over Mitt Romney, who garners 39%."
"A December surge propelled health care sign-ups through the government's rehabilitated website past the 1 million mark, the Obama administration said Sunday, reflecting new vigor for the problem-plagued federal insurance exchange.
Of the more than 1.1 million people now enrolled, nearly 1 million signed up in December, with the majority coming days before a pre-Christmas deadline for coverage to start in January. Compare that to a paltry 27,000 in October —the website's first, error-prone month — or 137,000 in November.
The figures tell only part of the story. The administration..."

"The Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday to hike interest rates by 75 basis points—the largest increase since 1994—heightened fears among economists that the central bank's attempt to tame inflation risks plunging the U.S. economy into recession and inflicting more pain on vulnerable workers.
The Fed's move came on the heels of worse-than-expected federal data showing that inflation jumped 8.6% in May compared to a year earlier, prompting central bank officials to pursue more aggressive federal-funds rate increases, the Fed's blunt tool to rein in consumer prices."
"Around the world, citizens appear to be re-engaging with democracy. In May, voter turnout at the European parliamentary elections reached a 20-year high, and in 2018 turnout for the United States midterm elections was the highest in a hundred years.
Yet in each instance, voter turnout reached just a feeble 50 percent. In the context of recent history, that was a surge. In the 2014 United States midterms, only 37 percent of the electorate voted, rising to 50 percent in 2018. In Europe, this year’s turnout was 50 percent —..."
"The defense of the top US military official kicked into gear across Washington Wednesday in response to claims that Gen. Mark Milley overstepped his authority during the waning days of the Trump administration.
The Joint Chiefs chairman came under attack Tuesday over new reporting in ""Peril,"" a forthcoming book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, which details Milley's phone conversations to reassure a nervous Chinese general and efforts Milley took to limit then-President Donald Trump from potentially ordering a dangerous military strike.

"Up to four million undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least five years can apply for a program that protects them from deportation and allows those with no criminal record to work legally in the country, President Obama is to announce on Thursday, according to people briefed on his plans.
An additional one million people will get protection from deportation through other parts of the president’s plan to overhaul the nation’s immigration enforcement system, including the expansion of an existing program for “Dreamers,” young immigrants..."
"Attorney General William Barr is not backing down from claims that he believes unauthorized spying took place on President Trump's campaign during the 2016 presidential election as the Justice Department makes moves to investigate the origins of the Russia probe. FBI officials have denied that the agency spied on the president's campaign.
In two separate interviews, Barr doubled down on his assertion that illegal spying did take place, a claim he made before senators last month. In a conversation with Fox News' Bill Hemmer on ""America's Newsroom,"" Barr suggested that..."
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about the “heartache” of the Trayvon Martin case in D.C. Tuesday evening while speaking to an African-American sorority group.
“My prayers are with the Martin family and with every family who loves someone who is lost to violence,” she said in an almost 30-minute speech. “No mother, no father, should ever have to fear for their child walking down a street in the United States of America.”

"President Donald Trump appears to be distancing himself from his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, amid reports that Giuliani is under investigation by federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York (SDNY).
""I don't know,"" Trump said Friday when reporters asked him if Giuliani was still his lawyer. ""I haven't spoken to Rudy ... He has been my attorney.""
When The Washington Post's Josh Dawsey texted Giuliani asking him about Trump's comments and if he was still representing the president, Giuliani replied, ""Yes."""
"For weeks, prominent Republican advisers have been privately imploring President Donald Trump to sideline Rudy Giuliani after a barrage of inconsistent, combative and occasionally cringe-inducing media interviews, according to three people familiar with the conversations.
And that was before the arrest of two foreign-born businessmen who reportedly helped Giuliani try to discredit former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democrat to take on Trump in next year’s election. Several reports have indicated Giuliani himself may be caught up in the probe."
"To the solemn lament of tolling bells and the mournful recitation of names of the fallen, Americans on Wednesday paused to commemorate the moment of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
Memorial events unfolded at the site of the former World Trade Center, the White House, the Pentagon and near Shanksville, Pa., as the nation reflected on the 12th anniversary of the attacks by airliners commandeered by Al Qaeda that killed nearly 3,000 people.
As in past years, the ceremony at the site of the former Twin Towers began..."
"A nation that just stepped back from the brink of conflict with Syria paused Wednesday to honor and reflect on the nearly 3,000 victims of 9/11, the day terrorist attacks spurred two other long-running conflicts in the Middle East.
In New York, hundreds of friends and families of the victims stood silently — many holding photos of their loved ones — as bagpipes played. Relatives recited the names of those killed when two hijacked commercial airliners slammed into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers. Another plane that day crashed into..."
"RICHMOND, Va. ─ Thousands of gun-rights activists, banned from carrying their weapons out of fear of violence, crammed into the Virginia Capitol on Monday to urge state lawmakers to reject sweeping measures to limit the spread of firearms.
The rally, planned for weeks as part of a citizen-lobbying tradition held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, has focused national attention on Virginia's attempts to enact new gun regulations, pushed by Democrats who took control of the Statehouse for the first time in 26 years. Gun control supporters say they are..."
"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Tens of thousands of gun-rights activists from around the country rallied peacefully at the Virginia Capitol on Monday to protest plans by the state’s Democratic leadership to pass gun-control legislation — a move that has become a key flash point in the national debate over gun violence
The size of the crowd and the expected participation of white supremacists and fringe militia groups raised fears that the state could see a repeat of the violence that exploded in 2017 in Charlottesville. But the rally concluded uneventfully..."
"Former President Donald Trump is coming back to social media -- but this time with his own network, a Trump spokesperson told Fox News on Sunday.

Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Md., is currently in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for jumping outstanding warrants, the Secret Service said in a statement."
"The apprehension of a man who jumped the White House fence Wednesday night and was bitten by a guard dog highlighted one of the Secret Service’s most effective weapons: its canines.
Secret Service agents and K-9 units quickly subdued the latest fence jumper, whom authorities identified as Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Md., after he punched two of the Secret Service dogs, Hurricane and Jordan, authorities say."
A legal brief the Justice Department filed with the Supreme Court Friday asking the justices to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act is raising hopes among gay rights advocates that President Barack Obama is on the verge of embracing a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage.
"Top aides to Gov. Andrew Cuomo altered a state Health Department report to obscure the true number of people killed by COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported late Thursday.
The aides, including the secretary to the governor, Melissa DeRosa, pushed state health officials to edit the July report so only residents who died inside long-term care facilities, and not those who became ill there and later died at a hospital, were counted, the newspapers reported, citing documents and people with..."
"Top aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo were alarmed: A report written by state health officials had just landed, and it included a count of how many nursing home residents in New York had died in the pandemic.
The number — more than 9,000 by that point in June — was not public, and the governor’s most senior aides wanted to keep it that way. They rewrote the report to take it out, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The extraordinary intervention, which came just..."
"During his first term as Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell faced blistering political pressure and an enormous economic crisis. He has confronted an ethics scandal within the central bank and the steepest inflation in more than 30 years.
Despite all that, or perhaps because of it, President Biden on Monday announced he was nominating the 68-year-old Fed chairman for another four-year term. Democrats and Republicans gleefully offered their support.
Powell somehow emerged stronger than ever from the economic, domestic and political convulsions of 2020. He steered the Fed through wild..."
"Every parade has an act that draws the eye, that brings a quick smile and a delighted laugh. 
An act like the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, who with their pom-poms, sense of humor and moxie have entertained crowds across the area for decades.
Funded in 1984, they usually performed 25 times a year, although they had to take a break in the earlier months of the pandemic.
""The Grannies are kind of a really tight unit,"" said Beth Krohn, a retired member of the group. ""We used to call it a sisterhood.""..."
"Emmanuel Macron received congratulations from around the world — including Moscow — on Monday after French voters made the centrist political neophyte their new president and rejected anti-E.U. firebrand Marine Le Pen.
But the raucous celebration among Macron supporters Sunday night — which also served as pep rally for the European Union — quickly gave way to the steep challenges ahead for Macron’s untested leadership."
"President Donald Trump's demand for vote counting to stop in an election that is still undecided may have been his most extreme and dangerous assault on the institutions of democracy yet in a presidency replete with them.
Trump appeared in the East Room of the White House early on Wednesday morning to claim falsely that he had already beaten Democrat Joe Biden, and the election was being stolen from him in a massive act of fraud. He vowed to mount a challenge in the Supreme Court and declared that he..."
"Election Day itself went off far more smoothly than many election officials would have predicted seven months ago, as the pandemic took hold in the middle of primary season.
But for months, those officials warned that the expected influx of mail-in votes this year could mean a longer wait before the winner of the presidency was known.
As Nov. 3 turned into Nov. 4, it became clear that's exactly what was happening.
Voting administrators worked into and through the wee hours in swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. Officials in..."
"The U.S. drug epidemic reached another terrible milestone Wednesday when the government announced that more than 100,000 people had died of overdoses between April 2020 and April 2021. It is the first time that drug-related deaths have reached six figures in any 12-month period.
The people who died — 275 every day — would fill the stadium where the University of Alabama plays football. Together, they equal the population of Roanoke, Va.
There are now more overdose deaths from the illegal synthetic opioid fentanyl than there were overdose deaths from all drugs in 2016."
"An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in one year, a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.
Overdose deaths have been rising for more than two decades, accelerated in the past two years and, according to new data posted Wednesday, jumped nearly 30% in the latest year.
President Joe Biden called it “a tragic milestone” in a statement, as administration officials pressed Congress to devote billions of dollars more to address the problem.
“This is unacceptable and..."
"Simone Biles and three fellow gymnasts offered gut-wrenching testimony to Congress on Wednesday, describing the abuse they suffered at the hands of doctor Larry Nassar and charging the FBI “turned a blind eye” as he molested young female patients.
Biles blamed USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympics committee and the FBI for the long-running abuse by the doctor, who molested girl and women athletes under the guise of medical treatments. At times, the 24-year-old superstar’s voice quivered as she tied her mental health difficulties at the Tokyo Olympics this summer directly..."
"In the days following the January 6 insurrection, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Republican lawmakers on a private conference call that then-President Donald Trump had admitted bearing some responsibility for the deadly attack, according to new audio -- a significant admission that sheds light on Trump's mindset in the immediate aftermath of the US Capitol riots.
A readout of that conversation, which took place on January 11, 2021, had been previously reported by CNN. But two New York Times reporters obtained an audio recording of the conference call for their..."
"For many people, Mother’s Day may conjure up images of croissants, mimosas, and brunch on the second Sunday of May, but did you know this holiday can trace its origins back to anti-war efforts in the 1800s? Here’s the story of where American Mother’s Day began, how it evolved, and why its founder eventually came to disown it altogether.
The origins of Mother’s Day can be traced back to the 1860s, according to historian Katharine Lane Antolini, when Ann Reeves Jarvis (shown above, left) started Mother’s Day Work Clubs..."
"Mother’s Day is still nearly a week away, but there are buds on the antique rambling rose that my mother rooted for me from her grandmother’s rose, and it will be in full bloom by Sunday, as it always is on Mother’s Day. My husband will make brunch. Our adult children will come over, and we’ll bring my husband’s 92-year-old father over, too, because he lives for family gatherings and has felt the loss of them more acutely than any of us. We’re all vaccinated now, but we won’t soon..."
"Ukraine’s military said it had retaken swathes of territory in Kherson on Thursday after Moscow ordered a partial withdrawal from the area, though officials in Kyiv warned that retreating Russian soldiers could turn the regional capital into a “city of death” on their way out.
A military spokesman said that in just 24 hours, Ukrainian forces had pushed the front line in the key southern region of Kherson forward by 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) and taken control of more than 260 square kilometers of territory (100 square miles). Kyiv said..."

He also said that his campaign hadn’t been part of a separate ca

"President Biden is starting to clear a legal path for relatives of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to pursue $3.5 billion that Afghanistan’s central bank had deposited in New York before the Taliban takeover, while also seeking to steer a roughly equal amount toward spending to aid the Afghan people.
Beginning that process, Mr. Biden issued an executive order Friday morning invoking emergency powers to consolidate and freeze all $7 billion of the total assets the Afghan central bank kept in New York. The administration said it would ask a judge for..."
"The U.S. has banned imports of Russian oil, President Joe Biden announced Tuesday, in a major escalation of economic sanctions intended to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his war in Ukraine.
Oil had been omitted from earlier sanctions to shield consumers from higher fuel costs, but with gas prices surging anyway and Congress likely to force the issue, Biden made the surprise announcement at the White House on Tuesday.
“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,” Biden said. “That means Russian oil will no longer..."
"Before the first launch attempt of the Artemis I mission last Monday, Wayne Hale, a former program manager of NASA’s space shuttle program, shared a note of caution on Twitter that the day could end up disappointing:
Bill Harwood, a longtime space reporter at CBS News, responded, “I think you’re being optimistic!”
In the past week, their words have been prophetic. On Saturday, when NASA tried for a second time to launch the Artemis I mission’s Space Launch System rocket, a leak in a hydrogen fuel line stymied engineers. They..."
"There's persistent ... and then there's Jake Tapper.
The CNN anchor posed the following question to Donald Trump on Friday:
Let me ask you about comments you made about the judge in the Trump University case. You said that you thought it was a conflict of interest that he was the judge because he is of Mexican heritage, even though he is from Indiana. Hillary Clinton said that that is a racist attack on a federal judge."
"President Biden and moderate Senate Democrats have struck a deal to limit eligibility for direct stimulus checks to Americans, lowering the income level for those who would qualify for payments, according to a Democratic source.
The Senate is set to take up Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill as early as Wednesday. Since the bill is not expected to attract any Republican votes, all Democrats will need to support the bill in order for it to pass, giving moderate Democrats leverage to make demands of the president and..."
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott followed through on his cruel promise to dump asylum seekers and migrants in the capital with the first busload conveniently arriving outside Fox News’ office on Wednesday morning.
Abbott vowed last week to bus them to the Capitol steps in response to the Biden administration’s decision to end Title 42, a pandemic-era emergency order implemented by Donald Trump that allowed migrants to be sent back to Mexico at the border, even if they were seeking asylum."
"In a memo to GOP campaigns released this week, the Republican National Committee laid out what it called a winning message on abortion: Press Democrats on where they stand on the procedure later in pregnancy, seek “common ground” on exceptions to bans and keep the focus on crime and the economy.
Then, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) introduced legislation to ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy — overshadowing new inflation numbers and undermining what many GOP strategists see as their best message for the fall: “Leave it to the states.”"
"Mark Judge, the high school friend of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh whom Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has said was present when she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh, said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would cooperate with any law enforcement agency that would ""confidentially investigate"" sexual misconduct allegations against him and Kavanaugh."
"Oregon's largest city was calm and quiet Sunday after a day of chaotic, competing protests that clogged Portland streets, crippled public transit and left at least eight people injured.
Police in riot gear broke up the demonstrations as clashes developed among law enforcers, anti-fascist ""antifa"" protesters and right-wing groups. Three people were charged with crimes ranging from assault on a police officer to harassment, police said.
As the violence increased, police declared a civil disturbance and ordered the protests dispersed. Pepper spray was used by demonstrators and police, Assistant Chief..."
"Two weeks after the building collapse at Surfside, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said 60 bodies have been recovered from the rubble, as authorities pledged on their first official day of search and recovery to find every single victim.
“The work continues with all speed and all urgency,” said Levine Cava during a press briefing on Thursday morning.
First responders paused their work briefly at 1:20 a.m. to honor the victims of the collapse and mark two full weeks since the partial collapse. As of Thursday morning, 80 people remained..."
"The Democratic National Committee has altered the criteria to qualify for the Nevada debate, almost doubling the polling threshold and eliminating donor requirements —which could make way for Michael Bloomberg to make it on stage.
The change has caused backlash from presidential candidates, as well as from Sen. Cory Booker's former campaign staff, who criticized the DNC as changing the rules in the middle of the game. Booker, who dropped out several weeks before the Iowa caucuses, said Friday they previously redirected campaigns funds to help bring in donors specifically..."
"The Democratic National Committee is drastically revising its criteria to participate in primary debates after New Hampshire, doubling the polling threshold and eliminating the individual donor requirement, which could pave the way for former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg to make the stage beginning in mid-February.
Candidates will need to earn at least 10 percent in four polls released from Jan. 15 to Feb. 18, or 12 percent in two polls conducted in Nevada or South Carolina, in order to participate in the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas...."
"With its ground troops forced to pull back in Ukraine and regroup, and its Black Sea flagship sunk, Russia’s military failings are mounting. No country is paying closer attention than China to how a smaller and outgunned force has badly bloodied what was thought to be one of the world’s most powerful armies.
China, like Russia, has been ambitiously reforming its Soviet-style military and experts say leader Xi Jinping will be carefully parsing the weaknesses exposed by the invasion of Ukraine as they might apply to his own People’s Liberation Army and..."
"With the recall election less than two weeks away, the mail ballot returns so far show that more than twice as many Democrats have voted than Republicans and that liberal areas of the state such as the Bay Area have the highest rates of return, according to state officials and political data researchers.
The early numbers provide good news for Gov. Gavin Newsom. But they also show his weaknesses and what his campaign must do between now and election day on Sept. 14 — turn out young and Latino voters..."
"Justice Amy Coney Barrett delivered her first Supreme Court majority opinion Thursday, ruling against an environmental group that had sought access to government records.
President Donald Trump’s third nominee wrote for a 7-2 court that certain draft documents do not have to be disclosed under the federal Freedom of Information Act. The case was the first one Barrett heard after joining the court in late October, and it took four months for the 11-page opinion to be released. Two liberal justices, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented."
"The Supreme Court ruled Thursday against an environmental group that sued the government for internal studies detailing potential harm to endangered aquatic species in the first major opinion by Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
The Sierra Club sued the Obama administration in 2015, arguing the Freedom of Information Act required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceto disclose studies about the biological impact of an Environmental Protection Agency rule outlining how power plants draw water to cool machinery.
The case marked the first time Barrett took part in oral arguments, which..."

"Former President George W. Bush says Americans should come together as one to confront the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed the lives of over 66,000 in the country so far.
In a video released on Saturday, the 43rd U.S. president said, “We are not partisan combatants. We’re human beings, equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God.”
Bush’s presidential center posted the message on Twitter, tagging @TheCallToUnite, a livestream for celebrities and public figures to post encouraging videos during the pandemic.
It got the Republican, who left office..."
"This past Saturday, former President George W. Bush released a brief video whose subtweeted message was unmistakable. It recognized the suffering of those who had lost family members, or economic prospects, or hope itself; it emphasized the all of us rather than the us and them response to national crisis; and it appealed to the generous rather than the resentful in human nature.
In short, it was the kind of message that leaders of any nation have been expected to transmit, as part of their duty, in time of national..."
"As Donald J. Trump weighs whether to open an unusually early White House campaign, a New York Times/Siena College poll shows that his post-presidential quest to consolidate his support within the Republican Party has instead left him weakened, with nearly half the party’s primary voters seeking someone different for president in 2024 and a significant number vowing to abandon him if he wins the nomination.
By focusing on political payback inside his party instead of tending to wounds opened by his alarming attempts to cling to power after his 2020 defeat, Mr...."
"The US hit a seven-day average of 265,427 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, blowing past the country's previous record of about 252,000 daily cases, reported nearly a year ago on January 11.
The new peak, according to Johns Hopkins University data, comes amid a rapid acceleration of infections in the United States -- and across the world -- since last month.
And experts predict the Omicron variant -- the most contagious strain of coronavirus yet -- is going to make the start of 2022 very difficult.
""January is going to be a..."
"The cry of ""Freedom!"" echoes across the land, rising from places like Texas, controlled by Republican officials who are using every tool at their disposal to ban mask mandates or vaccine requirements. It's curious, then, that as of Wednesday morning, the women of Texas are essentially banned from choosing to get an abortion.
The same politicians who declare that mask requirements are an intolerable intrusion by government into sacrosanct individual freedom, have just imposed the country's most restrictive abortion law since the Supreme Court made abortion legal in the landmark 1973 decision, Roe v...."
"Moderna, the Massachusetts biotechnology company behind a leading effort to create a coronavirus vaccine, announced promising early results from its first human safety tests Monday. The company plans to launch a large clinical trial in July aimed at showing whether the vaccine works.
The company reported that in eight patients who had been followed for a month and a half, the vaccine at low and medium doses triggered blood levels of virus-fighting antibodies that were similar or greater than those found in patients who recovered. That would suggest, but doesn’t..."
"In another extreme ruling, the Supreme Court has removed foundational, decades-old constitutional limits on religion in public schools. Its Monday decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District overruled a half-century of precedent to elevate the rights of public school officials over students. The ruling will allow these officials to engage in coercive sectarian prayer on the job. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s 6–3 decision is another maximalist attack on the separation of church and state, stripping students of their First Amendment freedom against religious indoctrination. His opinion also embraces a false narrative of faith-based persecution,..."

"Sen. Bernie Sanders proclaimed victory in the Iowa caucuses from his New Hampshire headquarters moments after Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez demanded a recanvass, or re-tabulation, of the results.
Almost four days after the caucuses took place on February 3, the Iowa Democratic Party still has not declared an official winner with 97% of the precincts reporting as of 2 p.m. Central Time due to a series of breakdowns in the reporting process and unexplained inconsistencies and errors in the results.
Because caucuses conduct two rounds of..."
"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called on the Iowa Democratic Party on Thursday to “immediately begin a recanvass” in the state after the caucus disaster earlier this week. “Enough is enough,” Perez tweeted, citing the “problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results.” The Daily Beast reported that a DNC aide defined Perez’s “recanvass” as a hand audit of caucus math worksheets and reporting forms to make sure that they were correctly tallied and reported..."

"Hillary Clinton, who has a huge lead in many early presidential polls, returned to Iowa on Sunday. The woman who says she has not yet decided on a 2016 presidential run appeared along with former President Bill Clinton in a state she has not visited since she lost the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama.
Her speech at the annual steak fry hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, a must-attend event for state Democratic activists, revealed little about her intentions — but also did nothing to dampen the widespread belief..."
"It was a preview of coming distractions.
When Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to return to the state where her presidential ambitions first came undone six years ago, the idea was that they would remind Democratic activists about the importance of the midterm elections and honor their host, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who is retiring from Congress and held his final steak fry fund-raiser here Sunday. And that was what transpired, in part, on a sun-splashed day on a balloon field here, just south of Des Moines...."
"President Donald Trump slammed Iran Friday, calling the country a ""menace"" and announced new sanctions against its regime -- but did not take action to alter the Obama-era nuclear deal that he has denounced since his presidential campaign.
The deal, Trump said, is no longer in the national security interest of the United States. This decision, which has been referred to as “decertification,” is a shift in official position.
It is a significant declaration that leaves the nuclear agreement in place, but puts Congress in charge of whether or not..."

Dozens of protesters took to the streets of Oregon's largest city following the inauguration of President Joe Biden. Some people were seen carrying Black Lives Matter signs, while others held banners with anti-Biden or anti-police slogans.

"Anyone who wants to dine, drink, exercise or enjoy a live performance indoors in New York City will soon have to show proof of coronavirus vaccination or be denied entry, Mayor de Blasio announced Tuesday in his most aggressive push yet to jack up the city’s flagging immunization rates.
The requirement, which mirrors mandates on leisure activities enforced in some European countries, is presumed to be the first-of-its-kind in the U.S. and comes as the Big Apple is seeing a delta-variant driven surge in new COVID-19 infections."
"When the US supreme court this week radically expanded the second amendment and declared most any restrictions on guns to be presumptively unconstitutional, then overturned five decades of reproductive rights and created a likely desert for abortion access all the way from Idaho to Florida, America’s grim new reality became painfully clear.
An extreme conservative majority holds absolute control over the court. They will likely hold this power for multiple generations. They intend to use it to impose a far-right vision that most Americans oppose, twisting the rule of law into whatever..."
"President Donald Trump’s decision to kill a top Iranian commander marks his most unabashed move yet to steamroll Congress on matters of war and peace.
Yet the powerlessness of Capitol Hill is of lawmakers’ own making.
Despite a concerted push from Democrats and a handful of Republicans to reassert congressional authority when it comes to military action abroad, Congress has done little to restrain Trump — or many presidents before him.
The White House gave zero notice to key congressional leaders about the U.S. drone strike on Qassem Soleimani, who..."
"Donald Trump is an unusual presence on the presidential debate stage. And it's not just because he's a businessman and untested politician who happens to be in the lead. It's also because he's, well, Donald Trump. His rhetorical devices, use of hyperbole, looseness with the facts and bravado simply cannot be compared to any recent presidential hopefuls."
"Senate Republicans and the White House remain plagued by deep ideological divides over major elements of the next coronavirus relief package, creating an opening for Democrats as the pace of negotiations accelerates.
With coronavirus cases soaring across the country, the U.S. economy in near tatters, and elections just over 100 days away, senior White House officials and the Senate GOP leadership have yet to find agreement on big portions of the soon-to-be-released Republican proposal. They’re still undecided on whether to propose a payroll tax cut or how to respond to..."
"Dear President Obama,
I am writing this to you from the place where I was born -- Flint, Michigan. Please consider this personal appeal from me and the 102,000 citizens of the city of Flint who have been poisoned -- not by a mistake, not by a natural disaster, but by a governor and his administration who, to ""cut costs,"" took over the city of Flint from its duly elected leaders, unhooked the city from its fresh water supply of Lake Huron, and then mad"
"Ukrainian forces surged forward in the country's east Friday after punching through Russian defenses in a surprise counteroffensive that could prove a decisive turning point in the war.

Officials shared a flood of images and videos from the region, with some verified by NBC News showing soldiers raising Ukrainian flags over once-occupied towns and villages or posing victoriously next to road signs. Others appeared to show troops being met..."
"The city of Cleveland and Department of Justice will announce as soon as this week how they are moving forward on agreed changes to the city's police force, law enforcement officials tell CNN.
The consent decree is the next step after the city agreed to changes last year following a scathing report from DOJ investigators regarding patterns of civil rights violations and excessive force by the Cleveland police. It will mean years of court-supervised monitoring of the Cleveland Police Department."
"A brutal Justice Department report in December found Cleveland police officers used excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists; and excessive force against people with mental illness or in crisis, including one situation in which officers were called exclusively to check up on someone's well-being.
In one case, a police officer shot at an unarmed man wearing only boxer shorts as he was fleeing from armed assailants:"

"Sen. John McCain slammed President Donald Trump's attacks on the media this week by noting dictators ""get started by suppressing free press.""
It was a startling observation from a sitting member of Congress against the President of the United States, especially considering McCain is a member of Trump's party."
"(CNN)Pennsylvania Republicans chose an election denier Tuesday as their candidate for governor in this year's midterm elections -- but appear to have rejected a far-right Senate contender.
As of early Wednesday, Mehmet Oz, the celebrity heart surgeon endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and retired hedge fund executive David McCormick are locked in a neck-and-neck battle in the Republican Senate primary that could take days to sort out. Conservative Kathy Barnette, who many Republican officials worried would surge past Oz and McCormick despite concerns about her electability, was in third place.

"President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, bringing the total amount of funding allocated to the country this week to $1 billion.
Biden’s announcement came on the heels of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s speech to Congress, in which Zelenskyy pleaded with the U.S. and its NATO allies to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine or send jets to aid in its fight against Russia. Biden made no mention of either Zelenskyy request, and emphasized the aid would empower Ukrainians to fight the..."
"A federal appeals court in New Orleans has halted the Biden administration’s vaccine or testing requirement for private businesses, delivering another political setback to one of the White House’s signature public health policies.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, helmed by one judge who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and two others who were appointed by President Donald Trump, issued the ruling Friday, after temporarily halting the mandate last weekend in response to lawsuits filed by Republican-aligned businesses and legal groups.

"Candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination took to the debate stage for the fifth time Wednesday night. There weren't any groundbreaking or game-changing moments, but here are five things that stood out:
1. Impeachment hearings may have taken some steam out of the debate
Let's face it: The biggest story of Wednesday was not the debate, it was the impeachment testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.
And you have to wonder if that had some effect on the energy in the debate and the willingness..."
"Democratic candidates for president took part in their party's fifth debate on Wednesday night in Atlanta and CNN commentators weighed in. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors.
Paul Begala: Buttigieg was the winner
After spending all day watching Republican congressmen (and one Republican congresswoman) during the impeachment hearings mindlessly denying the Everest of evidence of Donald Trump's alleged criminality, the Democratic debate was like a wake-up call from the real world.

Travelers are hurrying to their trains, tourists are gawking at the Harry Potter Platform 9 and 3/4, and there are virtually no security checks or extra police in sight. It’s as if Saturday night’s terrorist attack — where three attackers armed with a rental van and knives killed at least seven and wounded 48 less than three miles away — didn’t happen."

The dilemma is agonizing on every level, forcing longtime Cochran allies who have already spent millions defending him to gauge how realistic the beloved senior senator’s chances are to win a June 24 runoff."
"The hard-fought Mississippi Republican Senate primary is headed to a runoff between the six-term incumbent, Senator Thad Cochran, and his Tea Party-backed challenger, State Senator Chris McDaniel.

With 100 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Cochran and Mr. McDaniel each had about 49 percent, with a third candidate pulling in less than 2 percent. Mr. McDaniel was leading by 1,386 votes out of the 310,000 cast."

"“I have money from people who work for fossil-fuel companies. I am so sick — I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me.”
— Hillary Clinton, to a Greenpeace activist, March 31, 2016

"Virginia’s 2021 gubernatorial race revealed that the education wars will play a major role in politics for the foreseeable future. Debates over how history gets taught in schools and universities are increasingly framed in relation to “critical race theory,” a term that has been used to mean almost anything.

"In a previously undisclosed secret mission in 2017, the United States successfully extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government, multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge told CNN.
A person directly involved in the discussions said that the removal of the Russian was driven, in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.
The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting..."
"NEW DELHI – President Donald Trump took his battle with CNN overseas on Tuesday, as he and correspondent Jim Acosta clashed over truth-telling and reports over Russian interference in U.S. elections.
After Trump attacked CNN during a wide-ranging news conference in India, Acosta told the president: ""I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes, if you don’t mind me saying.""

"Centrist and conservative commentators are saying the recent pro-abortion rights protests outside the houses of conservative Supreme Court justices have crossed a line. These are mobs of harassers who have breached the acceptable parameters of protest, critics contend. But such arguments rest in large part on the myth of an apolitical judiciary. Looked at another way, the protests are salutary rather than destructive, bringing something to bear upon the court that by design it has been always been shielded from: democratic energy.

"Hillary Clinton’s claim that most work-related emails sent from her personal account were preserved in the electronic files of other State Department officials fell apart Friday.
After a week of deflecting questions about how emails were handled during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, the agency finally acknowledged that the email traffic of other senior officials was not automatically or routinely archived.

The loose record-keeping practices, which were immediately criticized by historians and open government advocates, are only now being corrected."
"After a week of stories about Hillary Clinton's use of email during her time as secretary of state, the controversy is more polarizing than ever. A new poll shows that Republicans are increasingly convinced of the issue's importance and Democrats are increasingly sure that the media is overhyping things, while independents remain somewhere in between.
In the aftermath of Clinton's press conference Tuesday, during which she fielded a number of questions about her use of a personal email account, attention to the story has continued to grow, a new HuffPost/YouGov..."

He said it’s the result of “the failure to have a real transition — cooperation from the last administration, like every other administration has done.”
After the November election, Biden said that..."

A long-running investigation into Trump’s business practices from the Manhattan district attorney’s office appears to have been derailed, as the two lead prosecutors, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, resigned Wednesday.

The big question is why. Did Bragg legitimately conclude that the case against Trump, which he inherited from former district attorney Cyrus..."

"There is a lot of talk in the West about Russian President Vladimir Putin being mentally unhinged. How could he not have known that his invasion of Ukraine would have serious consequences for his country? Or is he so obsessed with maintaining an image of greatness—especially ahead of Russia’s upcoming 2024 presidential elections—that he doesn’t care?
Either way, Putin risks losing the confidence of his people, whose economic suffering will increase as the conflict continues.
Perhaps the question of Putin’s sanity is beside the point, because there is little the West can do about..."

“Four years ago, I came to New Hampshire and I had a series of proposals that the political establishment said was very radical, too extreme,” Sanders told a crowd at Franklin Pierce University on Monday.
Many in the crowd hadn’t lived in the state back then. Many more had been too young to vote. They cheered along, applauding at the end of every sentence, as Sanders told them how he would overthrow the..."
"A Russian official has alleged that two Ukrainian military helicopters flew across the border and bombed a fuel depot in the eastern city of Belgorod, in what would be, if confirmed, the first known air raid by Ukraine’s forces on Russian soil since Moscow invaded its neighbour in late February.
Video images of the purported attack posted online on Friday showed what looked like several missiles being fired from low altitude, followed by an explosion that sparked a huge fire. It was not possible to independently verify the images.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry..."
"As much change as the 2020 election might bring on a national level, it’s unlikely to shake up many states’ leadership: Of the 11 states with governor races in 2020, nine have incumbents running for reelection, many of whom are expected to coast to victory.
That makes Montana, where current Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is leaving the seat open to run for US Senate, one of the cycle’s most contested gubernatorial races. Bullock’s lieutenant, Mike Cooney, is running against the current US House member in Montana’s at-large congressional district, Republican..."
"China has told the United States it will ""pay"" for its diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics on human rights grounds.
The White House on Monday announced it would not send any government officials to the Games in February 2022, due to ""ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.""
This prompted a stern response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who told a press conference Tuesday: ""The U.S. will pay for its wrongdoing. You can wait and see.""
Zhao accused the U.S. of hypocrisy and..."
"Former President Donald Trump is not a Nazi. He is not, nor has it been reported that he has ever been, a member of the National Socialist Party. He also is not, in fact, some sort of genetic copy of Adolf Hitler. To misappropriate Dickens: ""This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate.""
You see, Trump’s lawyers sued CNN alleging defamation in a Florida federal court Monday. The main focus of their ire? In reporting on their client’s ongoing lies..."
"The former Massachusetts governor made it official Friday. But State Auditor John Dougall said he’s being encouraged to challenge Romney in a primary. “Some of the key things in Utah are that we want to make sure we have a senator who understands Utah issues, and those are clearly different than Massachusetts issues, for instance.”"
"Belgium stepped up its efforts against suspected terrorists on Thursday with police raids, arrests and a heightened alert level across the country. Two suspects were killed in a gun battle near the German border, and the authorities said that a man suspected of links to last week’s deadly terror attacks in Paris had been arrested in southern Belgium.
The gun battle happened in Verviers, a town about 75 miles east of Brussels. The police were closing in on several suspects there in the early evening when they were met with..."
"At least two people were killed Thursday in Verviers, Belgium when police raided an apartment used by suspected Islamist radicals. Two unidentified people were killed, a third injured, and several others arrested. No police were hurt. Yesterday, a Belgian arms dealer turned himself in after saying he gave the Charlie Hebdo attackers weapons in Brussels last year.
Eric Van der Sypt, a spokesman for the office of the Belgian federal prosecutor, confirmed two people had been killed and one person was in custody. “All I can tell you now..."
"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister and will step down after a week-long emergency contest to find her successor, she has announced outside Downing Street.
It follows a turbulent 45 days in office during which Truss’s mini-budget crashed the markets, she lost two key ministers and shed the confidence of almost all her own MPs.
Her statement came after she met Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs at Downing Street, followed by her deputy PM, Thérèse Coffey, and the party chair, Jake Berry...."
"President Joe Biden's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Monday to postpone oral arguments in significant cases regarding former President Donald Trump's border wall and a controversial asylum policy.
The Justice Department said Biden has directed a ""pause in construction"" so that the administration can undertake an assessment ""of the legality of the funding and contracting methods used to construct the wall."" The American Civil Liberties Union, Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition asked the Supreme Court last year to block the construction the wall."
"On Tuesday, lawyers for President Trump appeared before the Supreme Court (hearing arguments again by telephone conference) to assert the claim that the nation’s chief executive is unaccountable to Congress or law enforcement authorities — that he is, in short, above the law.
The lawyers were trying to block three congressional committees and the Manhattan district attorney from getting access to years of Mr. Trump’s tax returns and other financial records, as well as those of his family members and companies. The House committees said they subpoenaed those records to..."
"In this country, there are only so many ways to deal with a man like Alex Jones.
On Wednesday, a jury in Connecticut tried its best to force the Infowars host and owner to face consequences for the hurt that his lies have caused others, ordering Jones to pay $965 million to relatives of victims of a 2012 mass shooting and an FBI agent he accused of all being actors.
In an interview with “PBS NewsHour,” trial lawyer Jesse Gessin described the nearly $1 billion judgment as “probably one of..."
Russia says it has carried out at least 20 airstrikes in Syria. But many of those attacks hit areas miles from the ISIS strongholds that were initially named as targets. Syria's opposition says Russian forces are hitting any opponents of President Bashar al-Assad — and that civilians are paying a price.
"Elon Musk just threw a wrench in the next US presidential election – to the benefit of Donald Trump.
With the man thought to be the world’s richest buying Twitter, the platform is likely in for some big shifts. Among them: changes to the terms of service that would allow currently banned users to return. That could include the former President.
Trump was permanently suspended after the January 6 riots; the company said it worried his tweets increased “the risk of further incitement of violence.” But Musk is a self-styled free speech..."
"Hong Kong’s chief executive apologized to the public on Sunday after a surprisingly large and defiant crowd poured onto the streets and converged on government offices. The protest capped a week of heated protests and soul-searching questions about the city’s ability to maintain some semblance of autonomy from mainland China.
Many opponents of an unpopular bill, slated to allow extraditions to mainland China, focused their anger on the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who insisted on pushing through the legislation despite a public outcry that grew into a series..."
"A key Senate committee is expected to vote as soon as Tuesday to advance Democrats’ sweeping elections overhaul, stamping its approval on a landmark voting rights expansion as Washington tries to blunt ballot restrictions by Republican-controlled statehouses.
The debate and anticipated vote in the Senate Rules Committee are a significant milestone for liberals who have made the bill, H.R. 1, their top legislative priority. If enacted, it would effectively override laws emerging in states like Georgia and Florida that raise barriers to vote with national requirements — like automatic voter..."
"President Trump is expected Wednesday to revoke a decades-old rule that empowers California to set tougher car emissions standards than those required by the federal government — putting the state and the administration on a path to years of fighting in court.
The move, which has been in the works for much of the last three years, would overturn the foundation for California’s role as an environmental leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. By revoking a special waiver the state has relied on for years to..."
"Joe Biden’s campaign will be running television ads in El Paso, San Antonio and Dallas-Fort Worth heading into Election Day. The Democratic nominee for vice president, Kamala Harris, is planning a visit to Texas during the homestretch of the campaign. And polls show the Biden-Harris ticket within striking distance — and, in some surveys, ahead — in the traditionally Republican state.
Texas may still not be among the top priorities of either party’s presidential nominee in 2020 — and President Donald Trump might still be the favorite here. But the..."
"Just before the stroke of midnight on September 20, 2016, at the height of last year’s presidential election, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent a private direct message to Donald Trump Jr., the Republican nominee’s oldest son and campaign surrogate. “A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,” WikiLeaks wrote. “The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?” (The site, which has since become a joint project with Mother Jones, was founded..."
"President Trump pressured Georgia’s Republican secretary of state to “find” him enough votes to overturn the presidential election and vaguely threatened him with “a criminal offense” during an hourlong telephone call on Saturday, according to an audio recording of the conversation.
Mr. Trump, who has spent almost nine weeks making false conspiracy claims about his loss to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., told Brad Raffensperger, the state’s top elections official, that he should recalculate the vote count so Mr. Trump, not Mr. Biden, would end up winning the state’s 16..."
"The Trump administration disclosed on Saturday a previously top-secret set of documents related to the wiretapping of Carter Page, the onetime Trump campaign adviser who was at the center of highly contentious accusations by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that the F.B.I. had abused its surveillance powers."
"President Joe Biden declared at the United Nations Wednesday that Russia has “shamelessly violated the core tenets” of the U.N with its “brutal, needless war” in Ukraine. He said the war is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for as he looked to rally allies to stand firm in backing the Ukrainian resistance.
Delivering a forceful condemnation of Russia’s seven-month invasion, Biden said reports of Russian abuses against civilians in Ukraine “should make your blood run cold.” And he said President Vladimir Putin’s new nuclear..."
"Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday morning signed into law a controversial voting bill aimed at curbing access to mail-in voting in the state, joining a host of other GOP-led states pushing new limits in connection with former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election.
In signing the bill during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" the Florida Republican highlighted provisions of the bill including stricter voter ID requirements for voting by mail, creating limits on who can pick up and return a voter's ballot,..."
"President Donald Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday, an unprecedented move by a president struggling to accept election defeat and angry at a Pentagon leader he believes wasn’t loyal enough.
The decision, which could unsettle international allies and Pentagon leadership, injects another element of uncertainty to a rocky transition period as Joe Biden prepares to assume the presidency.
Presidents who win reelection often replace Cabinet members, including the secretary of defense, but losing presidents have kept their Pentagon chiefs in place until Inauguration Day to preserve stability in..."
"Donald Trump won Kansas by a 15-point margin in 2020, sweeping 100 of the state’s 105 counties as the presidential candidate of a Republican Party that has for decades pledged to overturn the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights. So a lot of folks just presumed, prior to Tuesday’s Kansas vote on whether to remove protections for abortion access from their state Constitution, that the anti-choice position would prevail.
But the first statewide vote on abortion rights since the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court overturned Roe didn’t go as the right..."
"Danielle and Colin Lloyd spent the past year trying to buy a house in Atlanta, which went about as you'd expect these days.
""There is just nothing in this whole area, just nothing,"" says Danielle. The couple was looking for a place with at least a small yard and space for their three young kids.
""The prices were just ridiculous,"" says Colin. ""People were just bidding much higher than what the house was listed for.""
""I only cried twice,"" Danielle chimes in.
Meanwhile, their landlord was about to raise their..."
"COMPTON, Calif. — President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Sunday denounced what police called an ambush of two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and said the attacker, still at large, should face harsh punishment.
The sheriff expressed optimism Sunday that the deputies would recover after being shot Saturday night as they sat in their patrol vehicle in Compton. A video released by authorities shows a person walk up to a parked police car, fire a gun into the passenger-side window and then run away.

"President Barack Obama on Friday announced a major election-year immigration policy shift to halt the deportation of certain younger illegal immigrants and grant them work permits, infuriating Republicans with what the president said is a step toward making the countrys immigration system “more fair, more efficient and more just."
"Did you ever wonder why Charlie Brown kept charging at the football, despite the fact that Lucy always pulled it away and he wound up flat on his back? You would think that experience has made him skeptical. It's because he really wanted to believe that, this time, things would work out. And when you really want to believe in something, you have a short memory when it comes to past disappointments."
"Considering the stubbornness of his opposition, I thought President Barack Obama was being quite generous in expressing “regrets” over his role in Washington’s dysfunction.
“It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency,” he said, “that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.”
He shouldn’t be too hard on himself, in my view. When it comes to stirring “rancor an"
"It is “extremely unlikely” that the coronavirus leaked from a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where Covid-19 first emerged, according to the head of a team of experts that on Tuesday released the first details of its fact-finding mission into the virus's origins.
Dr. Peter Ben Embarek from the World Health Organization said it was more likely that the virus, which has now claimed more than 2.3 million lives worldwide, had jumped to humans from an animal.

"Donald Trump and his allies lost the first battle for post-election control of the Republican Party Wednesday night – but not without a fight, making clear that the political war within the GOP is nowhere near over.
House Republicans voted Wednesday to keep Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in her leadership position despite her January impeachment vote against the now-former president. The secret-ballot vote was overwhelmingly in Cheney's favor, 145-61.
Nevertheless, Trump's backers have vowed to defeat Cheney and other Republicans who voted for his impeachment in their future political races...."
"The top House Republican leader moved Wednesday to keep his splintering party intact — declining to take concrete action against a freshman lawmaker whose extremist rhetoric prompted widespread outrage, while also moving to protect a senior party leader who faced calls for her ouster after backing Donald Trump’s impeachment.
The moves from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reflected the delicate path the GOP is blazing through the post-Trump political landscape as it seeks to regain power in Washington.
On one hand, the party needs to regain its appeal with traditional..."
"On August 29, a US drone strike killed 10 members of one family in Kabul. That same day, the Pentagon announced that the operation successfully targeted a suicide bomber affiliated with ISIS-K, who had allegedly filled a car with explosives as part of a suspected plan to attack the Hamid Karzai International Airport, where US troops raced to complete their evacuation operation a day before their deadline.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, had previously called the attack a ""righteous strike,"" days after two bombing attacks outside the airport killed 13 US..."
"The United States’ population grew by just 0.1 percent in the past year, the lowest rate since the nation’s founding, according to estimates released Tuesday by the Census Bureau — a slowdown in which the coronavirus pandemic had a major role.
The country’s population increased by 392,665 in the year ending on July 1, 2021. Some of the reduced rate of growth can be attributed to decreased immigration, reduced fertility and an aging population, trends underway before the pandemic. But the pandemic helped push the rate down to almost flat..."
"West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday he has approved recommendations to fire all of the correctional officer cadets who participated in an apparent Nazi salute during a class photo.
""As I said from the beginning, I condemn the photo of Basic Training Class 18 in the strongest possible terms,"" Justice said in a statement.
""I also said that this act needed to result in real consequences — terminations and dismissals,"" he added. ""This kind of behavior will not be tolerated on my watch in any agency of State government.""..."
"West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday he has approved the recommendations from a report calling for the firing of all correctional officer cadets who participated in a Nazi salute during a class photo.
The photo of Basic Training Class 18, released by the state's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety on Dec. 5 with the employees’ faces blurred, shows about 30 uniformed trainees posing with their right arms raised, most of them with their hands also extended. The words “Hail Byrd!” also appear at the top of the..."
"Kim wanted sanctions to be “lifted in their entirety and we wouldn’t do that,” the president said.
President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to reach a nuclear agreement during their second summit, which was abruptly cut short in Hanoi, Vietnam on Thursday afternoon.
Speaking to reporters following his negotiations with Kim, Trump said there were two sticking points that had made a deal “inappropriate” at this time. Kim wanted sanctions to be “lifted in their entirety and we wouldn’t do that,” the president said.

"President Biden said on Monday that activists who have confronted Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., in recent days went too far, even as he described such confrontations as a common facet of life in politics.
“I don’t think they’re appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody,” Biden said in a question-and-answer session with reporters following a speech he gave about the debt ceiling."
"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that she will join a growing list of Republican governors sending law enforcement officers to the U.S. border with Mexico.
Noem's announcement that she will send up to 50 South Dakota National Guard troops to Texas comes as the GOP ramps up a political fight with President Joe Biden over border security. The issue has drawn a host of prominent GOP figures: former President Donald Trump was expected to travel to the border this week and Republican governors from Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have all committed to sending law enforcement officers for..."
"The Biden administration is expected to announce Friday that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lift its requirement for travelers to test negative for Covid-19 before entering the US, according to a senior administration official and a US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention official.
The move, which CNN was first to report, will go into effect for US-bound air travelers at midnight on Sunday, the officials said.
The CDC is lifting the restriction that the travel industry had lobbied against for months after determining it was no longer necessary..."
"WASHINGTON — Voters in Kentucky and New York were selecting nominees in extraordinary circumstances on Tuesday, as fears about the coronavirus reduced the number of polling places and led to a surge in absentee balloting that was almost certain to delay the results, possibly for days.
Kentucky Democrats were deciding who would be their nominee against Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, in a race that was testing the power of money against the potency of the grass-roots activism that has sprung up around the Black Lives Matter movement."
"Kentucky and New York had primaries Tuesday, but the winners of the closest races probably won’t be known until next week. What’s going on?
Get used to it. Slow vote counts and delayed results are a feature of elections during the pandemic and are likely to continue into the general election in November, when many election officials say that, absent a landslide, it won’t be clear who won the presidential election for several days."

Late Wednesday, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which has blocked the mandate, transferred its case to the 6th Circuit, where 34 challenges filed nationwide will be consolidated after that court was picked through a lottery on Tuesday. The Justice Department is expected to file a motion with the 6th Circuit to try to vacate the order blocking the mandate...."

"At some point in every election cycle, a TV news anchor — and more likely several of them — will speak in reverential tones about “the wisdom of the American people.” This expression of clichéd, lazy patriotism implies that the collective choice made by voters when they go to the polls is magically infallible. Unfortunately, that is simply not true."

"For Merrick Garland, a well-regarded lawyer and federal judge — and onetime Supreme Court nominee — there was a critical condition under which he’d accept the nomination of attorney general under President Biden.
“Merrick’s acceptance comment was, ‘President-elect Biden has guaranteed me independence,’” Earl Steinberg, a childhood friend of Garland, recalled from Biden and Garland’s Jan. 7 nomination announcement. “Then he choked up a little bit and said, ‘or I would not have accepted the nomination.’ That is classic Merrick.”
It seemed to strike Steinberg as an encapsulation of the..."

And there was a new entrant in the ring, who took a lot of incoming: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spent more than $300 million of his own money on ads to raise his profile.
Bloomberg qualified for the debate just the day before, after an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll became the fourth national survey showing him with 10% or more support in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Herewith, six takeaways..."
"The sharp exchanges in the Nevada debate reflected the urgency of the moment as Michael Bloomberg, in his first presidential debate, was repeatedly criticized in personal terms.
The Democratic presidential candidates turned on one another in scorching and personal terms in a debate on Wednesday night, with two of the leading candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders and Michael R. Bloomberg, forced onto the defensive repeatedly throughout the evening.
In his first appearance in a presidential debate, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, struggled from the start to address..."
"U.S. employers added 1.8 million jobs last month, as the unemployment rate dipped to 10.2%.
The pace of hiring slowed from June, when employers added a record 4.8 million jobs. That suggests a long road back to full employment for the tens of millions of people who have been laid off during the coronavirus pandemic.
""There are still a lot of people on the sidelines,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. ""That's going to have a big impact on what we see in terms of consumer..."
"U.S. employers regained fewer jobs in July after a record gain in June, as a resurgence of coronavirus cases in some states earlier this summer weighed on the labor market recovery. However, the number of jobs added topped estimates, and the unemployment rate fell more than expected.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — A hard-won budget and debt deal easily cleared the Senate on Thursday, powered by President Donald Trump’s endorsement and a bipartisan drive to cement recent spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies. The legislation passed by a 67-28 vote as Trump and his GOP allies relied on lots of Democratic votes to propel it over the finish line. Passage marked a drama-free solution to a worrisome set of looming Washington deadlines as both allies and adversaries of the president set aside ideology in exchange for relative..."
"(CNN)The Senate passed Thursday a massive budget deal that would stave off the looming threat of a potential default on US debt and prevent automatic spending cuts to domestic and military funding.
The a final vote was 67-28 and the bill will now go to President Donald Trump for his signature.
The vote followed days of grumbling from GOP senators about the cost of the package and uncertainty surrounding who will support it.
The agreement, negotiated between congressional leaders and the Trump administration, represents a significant bipartisan compromise..."
"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol issued a new batch of subpoenas on Monday to former Trump administration and re-election campaign aides who supported then-President Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election.
Six individuals were subpoenaed: Bill Stepien, Trump's 2020 reelection campaign manager; Jason Miller, a senior campaign adviser; Angela McCallum, a former campaign aide; John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who reportedly advised Trump and others in the administration; Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser; and Bernard Kerik, an adviser who the committee said used Washington, D.C. hotels to serve as..."
"On Saturday, University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas placed last in the 100-yard freestyle swim during the NCAA championships, ending her career in collegiate swimming. A last-place showing at an NCAA swim meet, even a championship one, would not typically garner national headlines. Yet, Thomas has been at the center of controversy regarding her eligibility to compete in women's events.
This controversy came to an apex last week at the NCAA championships when she became the first openly trans athlete to win a Division I championship in any sport. For anyone who cares about..."
"This is the first piece in “Black History, Continued,” a series that will explore pivotal moments and transformative figures in Black culture and examine how the past shapes the present and the future.
In the early 20th century, before Negro History Week had turned into Black History Month, African-American teachers and children in schools throughout the segregated South would paste images of celebrated figures of Black history on the walls of their schools. It was a public affirmation that greatness existed among their people despite oppression. As a woman born..."
"It’s an understatement to say that 2020 got on Black folks’ collective last nerve.
We began the year with a COVID-19 pandemic that hit us harder than any other group of Americans and exposed the systemic inequities still at the root of the nation’s institutions despite the gains of the civil rights movement.
Black people were among essential workers risking their lives to serve others, but also among the first to lose their jobs after stay-at-home orders shuttered businesses in every state. Many of us lost friends and relatives..."
"Children under 5 are not known for respecting personal space or keeping germs to themselves — even in the best of circumstances. And when you get lots of these little drooling, hugging, shouting humans together in one space, such as day care, illnesses tend to spread rapidly, bouncing among children, their families, and back again.
While some child care centers around the country have remained open in the Covid-19 pandemic, many US states and localities have required them to close or limit services to health care worker parents only. According..."
"On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will open a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.
The proceedings came after a whistleblower complaint revealed that the President asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over corruption allegations at least eight times during a July phone call.
Stocks tumbled following the announcement, then gained Wednesday when President Trump signaled that a deal between the US and China could be coming soon. By Thursday, geopolitical fears had..."
"If the Senate were to remove President Donald Trump from office—which could happen only on a bipartisan vote—the 2016 election results wouldn’t be overturned. Democrats wouldn’t control the White House. America’s reward for convicting Trump would be President Michael Richard Pence.
Nine out of every 10 Republican respondents said in a Quinnipiac poll released Monday that Trump should not be impeached and removed from office. But President Pence would likely be harder for Democrats to dispatch in the 2020 general election than an impeached but still in office President Trump...."
"The Senate officially presided over the demise of bipartisan energy efficiency legislation Monday — and the chance to put the Keystone XL pipeline up for a vote ahead of the midterm elections. On a 55-36 vote, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed Monday to move ahead on the innocuous and popular efficiency bill from Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that had been caught in the headwinds of the far more politically fraught debates over the Keystone pipeline and EPA regulations."
"Security and safety came into sharp focus on the eve of the Republican convention, threatening to overshadow the first day of an event dedicated to safety and security.

"The number of Americans quitting their jobs is the highest on record, as workers take advantage of strong employer demand to pursue better opportunities.
Yet despite that leverage, an overwhelming majority of Americans say they are worried about inflation — and most say their pay isn’t keeping up with rising prices.
That contrast — evident in survey results released on Tuesday — underscores the strange, contradictory moment facing the U.S. economy after two years of pandemic-induced disruptions.
For some workers, particularly at the lower end of the pay scale, the..."
"Election Day is here, and voters will reveal whether tightening polls in competitive statewide races will mean a “red wave” sweeps the country.
If that wave turns out not to be as strong as expected, Democrats can likely thank split-ticket voting, the practice of electing candidates from different political parties for different statewide, congressional, or presidential races.
Split-ticket voting was once far more common, in part because of a belief expressed by Elon Musk recently. In endorsing Republicans up and down the ballot Monday night, he argued that “shared power curbs the worst excesses..."
"The U.S. Secret Service motto is ""Worthy of Trust and Confidence."" Recent events, including the apparent deletion of Jan. 6 evidence, have put a large question mark after that phrase, and the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is moving to answer the question. Producing a complete inventory of the agency's texts around Jan. 5 and 6, 2021, is vital to the committee's search for truth.
The Secret Service was already embroiled in controversy about whether former agents may have been involved in witness intimidation targeting star committee witness..."

"The college football season remains in a state of flux, with the NCAA’s member institutions and conferences not exactly presenting a united front with regard to how to proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
As matters stand now, two major conferences, the Big Ten and the Pac-12, will not play this fall. Two others, the SEC and the ACC, are hoping to move ahead with the plans they announced last week to delay competition until late September and move ahead with games. The Big 12 followed Wednesday by confirming its plans...."

"The bursting of the cryptocurrency bubble will end the way other speculative crazes have concluded: in a trail of wreckage across companies, continents — and unlucky investors.

"President Joe Biden said Monday that the U.S. would intervene militarily if China were to invade Taiwan, saying the burden to protect Taiwan is “even stronger’ after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It was one of the most forceful presidential statements in support of self-governing in decades.
Biden, at a news conference in Tokyo, said “yes” when asked if he was willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if China invaded. “That’s the commitment we made,” he added.
The U.S. traditionally has avoided making such an explicit security guarantee to..."

The vote on the bill, authored by House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), was 267 to 157. The bill drew significant Republican support, with 47 of the 211 House GOP members voting in favor, while no Democrats voted against it. The bipartisan support for the legislation suggests how much political momentum the issue has gained since the 2015 Supreme Court..."

"Apart from who wins the White House, which party wins the Senate majority is probably the biggest open question of 2020.
To have a governing majority next year in Washington, Democrats need control of the Senate. Without it, much — maybe even most — of an agenda by a President Joe Biden will be dead on arrival in a Republican-controlled Senate."
"The presidential election isn't the only critical race happening on November 3. Democrats and Republicans will battle across the country over control of the Senate.
The Senate is currently split 53-47 between Republicans and Democrats. There are 35 seats up for election in the Senate, and of those, 23 belong to Republicans and 12 to Democrats. Democrats would need to win four seats for a majority, or three seats if Democrats win the White House.
There are now nine Republican-held seats rated as either leaning Democratic or toss-ups..."

"The U.N. General Assembly voted at an emergency special session Wednesday to demand an immediate halt to Moscow’s offensive against Ukraine and withdrawal of all Russian troops, with very strong support from the world organization’s 193 member nations that sparked sustained applause.
The vote on the resolution, entitled “Aggression against Ukraine,” was 141-5 with 35 abstentions.
Russia got support for its appeal to vote against the resolution only from Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea, a powerful indication of the international isolation that Russian President Vladimir Putin faces for invading..."

"The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted to change how the Internet is regulated in the most consequential decision of its kind since the Internet’s creation. By a 3-2 vote along party lines, FCC commissioners endorsed “net neutrality.” Now Internet service providers will be prohibited from creating “fast lanes” for certain content providers, e.g. Comcast speeding up Netflix over YouTube. In layman’s terms, the Internet will now be regulated as a public utility along the lines of electricity or water. “The Internet is simply too important to allow broadband providers..."
"The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to approve strong net neutrality rules in a stunning decision, defying vocal, months-long opposition by telecom and cable companies and Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Democrats in the House of Representatives announced they will introduce two articles of impeachment Tuesday morning, making clear they intend to charge President Donald Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Both articles are based on the Ukraine scandal, meaning the party decided not to introduce any articles of impeachment solely based on the Mueller report, as some had pushed for.

"The European Union agreed on Wednesday to reopen its borders to visitors who have been fully vaccinated with an approved shot and to those coming from a list of countries considered safe from a coronavirus perspective, permitting broader travel just in time for the summer tourism season.
Ambassadors from the 27 member states of the European Union endorsed a plan that would allow visits from tourists and other nonessential travelers, who have been mostly barred from entering the bloc for more than a year."
"Late Thursday night the biggest earthquake to hit Mexico in 100 years shook the country—and a large part of the globe. The magnitude 8.1 temblor was centered just off the southern end of Mexico’s Pacific coast. It was stronger than the 1985 quake that killed thousands of people in Mexico City. Last night’s quake took 32 lives, according to news reports, and the toll may rise."
"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., on Sunday endorsed the re-election campaign of his Republican colleague Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who faces a tough challenger this year supported by former President Donald Trump.
""I'm endorsing my dear friend Lisa Murkowski,"" Manchin said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Alaska could only be so lucky to have her continue to serve them.""
Murkowski returned the favor, saying she will endorse Manchin, who is up for re-election in 2024, if he decides to run.
The two moderate senators appeared on the show in a joint interview to promote bipartisanship..."
"In a rare show of bipartisanship, Sens. Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski appeared in a joint TV interview on Sunday and exchanged endorsements.
Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" during which Manchin endorsed her and called her a ""dear friend.""
""It's hypocritical to work with a person day-in and day-out and then when they're in cycle you're supposed to be against them because they have an R or a D by their name,"" Manchin said. ""If these are good..."
"Melania Trump says bullying is one of the issues she's using her first lady platform to address. And in a new clip from her interview with ABC News' Tom Llamas, part of her first TV interview as first lady which will air in its entirety Friday, Trump says she's experienced her fair share of bullying firsthand."
"Congress declared a holiday truce in the budget wars Wednesday, sending President Obama a blueprint for funding the government through 2015. But the next skirmish was already on the horizon: an election-year fight over the national debt.
The budget deal that passed the Senate on Wednesday amounts to a handshake"
"For the first time in what seems like ages, Congress has passed a government spending plan without resorting to last-minute brinkmanship such as midnight negotiations to prevent an imminent government shutdown.
The Senate voted 64-36 on Wednesday to send the compromise federal budget framework to President Barack Obama, who has signaled his support."
"House Democrats on Tuesday approved a roughly $3.5 trillion budget that could enable sweeping changes to the nation’s health-care, education and tax laws, overcoming their own internal divisions to take the next step toward enacting President Biden’s broader economic agenda.
The 220-to-212 party-line vote came after days of delays as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) scrambled to stave off a revolt from her party’s moderate-leaning lawmakers. With the frenzy resolved, the chamber averted what would have been a political embarrassment for the White House and its allies — even as..."
"House Democrats aren't optimistic they'll see Trump's tax returns Wednesday.
That's the deadline they had given IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of President Donald Trump's personal and business tax returns to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat.
But a week after Neal made his formal request for Trump's tax information, including information on eight of the President's business entities, Democrats are fully anticipating a drawn-out political and legal showdown as the administration digs in and Democrats prepare to go to court.
""They..."
"The source of the coronavirus that has left more than 3 million people dead around the world remains a mystery. But in recent months the idea that it emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) — once dismissed as a ridiculous conspiracy theory — has gained new credence.
How and why did this happen? For one, efforts to discover a natural source of the virus have failed. Second, early efforts to spotlight a lab leak often got mixed up with speculation that the virus was deliberately created as a bioweapon. That made it..."
"As President Joe Biden convenes a virtual climate summit on Thursday with 40 world leaders, he faces a vexing task: how to put forward a nonbinding but symbolic goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will have a tangible impact on climate change efforts not only in the U.S. but throughout the world.
The emissions target, eagerly awaited by all sides of the climate debate, will signal how aggressively Biden wants to move on climate change, a divisive and expensive issue that has riled Republicans to complain about job-killing government..."
"Joe Biden faces a key test of his commitment to climate action this week, when he sets out his core plans for tackling the climate crisis and calls on all of the world’s major economies to join him in bold action to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the next ten years.
The US president has made the climate emergency one of his administration’s top priorities, and stated that clean growth must be the route for the US to rebound from the coronavirus crisis.
Biden and his climate envoy, John Kerry,..."
"Roger Stone, a friend of President Donald Trump and longtime Republican campaign adviser, was sentenced to three years, four months in federal prison Thursday for obstructing a congressional investigation of Russia's 2016 presidential election meddling.
“He was not prosecuted, as some have complained, for standing up for the president. He was prosecuted for covering up for the president,” Federal District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said before she handed down her sentence of 40 months, a $20,000 fine, two years of probation and 250 hours of community service.

"Former Vice President Mike Pence’s top aide warned the Secret Service the day before last year’s riot at the U.S. Capitol that Pence could be in danger after an expected betrayal by then-President Donald Trump, The New York Times reported Friday.
Chief of staff Marc Short told Pence’s lead Secret Service agent, Tim Giebels, that Trump was “going to turn publicly against the vice president, and there could be a security risk to Mr. Pence because of it,” reported Times journalist Maggie Haberman.
Short couldn’t predict what form the risk could take, but he did know that Pence’s..."
"The Obama administration on Friday made the latest contribution to a fast-moving legal battle over same-sex marriage rights as the Justice Department said that the federal government would recognize as lawful the marriages of some 1,300 same-sex couples in Utah even though the state government is largely refusing to do so.
The announcement furthered President Obama’s self-described evolution on same-sex marriage rights. He was once a politician who said he was “not in favor of gay marriage” and repeatedly invoked the rights of states to decide how marriage should be..."
"For three years, conservatives hyped John Durham’s investigation into the origins of the FBI’s original investigation of Russia’s effort to help Donald Trump get elected president in 2016. Durham, a prosecutor appointed in 2019 by then-Attorney General William P. Barr, would blow the lid off the real scandal, they said, which was a conspiracy between Democrats and the FBI to get Trump. This would show there was never anything to the Russiagate scandal.
Durham had all the time and resources he needed. As of last December, a partial accounting found he had spent about..."
"What seemed unfathomable just six months ago – a 75-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve – has now happened twice in a row.
At the conclusion of its July monetary policymaking meeting, members of the US central bank on Wednesday once again approved a supersized interest rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point. Members voted unanimously in favor of the aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation.
The unprecedented action emphasizes how far the Fed is willing to push the economy to temper rising costs for Americans amid the highest..."
"At one point during Wednesday night's vice presidential debate, Mike Pence answered a question about abortion laws in Indiana by discussing Qasem Soleimani. Kamala Harris responded to a question about whether she and Joe Biden would expand the Supreme Court by invoking Abe Lincoln.
Let's say this at the outset: This was a boring, unfocused debate between two well-prepared and polished candidates who had little interest in answering the questions posed to them — and were under virtually no pressure from the moderator to do so.
In other words, it..."
"Jimmy Dorrell is the kind of Texas pastor who slips into preaching mode within the first five minutes of conversation, who has to tell two stories before finishing the first. His jokes can skip right past you if you’re not paying attention. On Palm Sunday, the fast-talking 70-year-old stood in the middle of Waco’s Webster Avenue, near Baylor University, wearing a light-blue face mask and a black hoodie, surrounded at six-foot intervals by homeless men and women waving palm fronds. Beside the street’s double yellow lines, a tattooed Jesus washed..."
"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis called for solidarity the world over to confront the “epochal challenge” posed by the coronavirus pandemic, as Christians celebrated a solitary Easter Sunday, blending the joyful feast day with sorrow over the toll the virus has already taken.
Families that normally would attend morning Mass wearing their Easter best and later join friends for celebratory lunches hunkered down at home. Police checkpoints in Europe and closed churches around the globe forced the faithful to watch Easter services online or on TV.
A few lucky..."
"In a speech today at NYU's Stern Business School, Hillary Clinton plans to finger what she considers a key impediment to long-term economic growth: ""quarterly capitalism."" It's a brand of excessively short-term thinking in which Wall Street considerations end up doing too much to drive Main Street business decisions.
It's an intriguing way to drive a conceptually left-wing message that many business executives actually agree with, and a demonstration that there's no necessary tension between a progressive economic approach focused on fairness and a more centrist one focused on growth."
"It wasn’t the smoking gun President Trump’s critics had hoped for. Far from it.
Some even thought MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s apparent scoop on Trump’s leaked 2005 tax return made him look good. After all, the New York Times had once suggested that he had avoided taxes, and others that he was faking the extent of his wealth."
"Donald Trump earned more than $150 million in the year 2005—and paid just a small percentage of that in regular federal income taxes. Daily Beast contributor David Cay Johnston has obtained what appear to be the first two pages of Trump’s 2005 federal income-tax return, and published an analysis of those pages on his website, DCReport.org. The Daily Beast could not independently verify these documents."
"Amid criticism of his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump routinely flags one action as efficient and bold: restricting travel from China into the United States.
Trump has said he instituted a travel ban against everyone’s wishes and that ""nobody,"" not even doctors, wanted him to restrict travel. But ""probably tens of thousands"" of people would be dead now if he hadn’t done so, he claimed on Fox News March 24."
"“Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably,” the great Homer Simpson once observed. “The lesson is: never try.” That’s probably how the so-called “smart set” within the Republican Party feels these days. Ever since Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat—a loss that caught everyone off guard except for people who followed public opinion polls or read a newspaper—we Republicans were promised a tough, new approach to the presidential primary process."
"A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected a Trump administration request to allow its travel ban to take effect.
The three-judge appeals panel declined to overturn a lower court's order suspending the president's ban against entry into the United States by refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations."
"Former President Donald Trump asked a judge Monday to order the appointment of a special master to oversee the handling of the documents seized in the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate two weeks ago.
The court filing also asks the judge to require the Justice Department to return materials not covered by the scope of the search warrant, which Trump's team refers to as ""overbroad."" The filing also calls the Justice Department's decision to search the estate in Palm Beach, Florida, on Aug. 8 a ""shockingly aggressive move.""

"House and Senate negotiators were putting the finishing touches Sunday on what would be the first successful budget accord since 2011, when the battle over a soaring national debt first paralyzed Washington.
The deal expected to be sealed this week on Capitol Hill would not significantly reduce the debt, now $17.3 trillion and rising. It would not close corporate tax loopholes or reform expensive health-care and retirement programs. It would not even fully replace sharp spending cuts known as the"
"Largely shut out of the budget negotiations, Capitol Hill’s minority parties are getting increasingly antsy about the emerging agreement.
Senate Republicans and House Democrats are learning the details of a possible deal largely through the media. For Republicans, their unease is caused by news that domestic spending may surpass existing caps, fueled by an increase in fees on government services. House Democrats are growing angry over the increased likelihood that federal workers’ benefits are going to be cut and the possible exclusion of unemployment ins"
"Joe Biden will head to Europe for his first overseas trip as president, the White House announced on Friday, traveling in mid-June to the United Kingdom and Belgium.
Biden will attend international summits during the trip, including the G-7 summit in Cornwall, England, from June 11-13 and then the June 14 NATO Summit in Brussels. While in Brussels, Biden will also participate in a U.S.-EU summit, the White House said."
"President Biden is trying to pull off a neat trick with his so-called billionaire tax plan: to raise taxes on the wealthy without directly taxing wealth.
The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives Congress “power to lay and collect taxes on incomes.” Wealth is not income, so courts have found that straight-ahead wealth taxes are unconstitutional.
Biden’s plan gets around that large obstacle by taxing billionaires on the increase in their wealth. That gain, the administration argues, can be considered income: If your horse farm or your Renoir painting doubles in value, that..."
"Russia took aim Sunday at Western military supplies for Ukraine, launching airstrikes on Kyiv that it claimed destroyed tanks donated from abroad, as Vladimir Putin warned that any Western deliveries of longer-range rocket systems would prompt Moscow to hit “objects that we haven’t yet struck.”
The Russian leader’s cryptic threat of military escalation did not specify what the new targets might be. It came days after the United States announced plans to deliver $700 million of security assistance for Ukraine that includes four precision-guided, medium-range rocket systems, as well as helicopters, Javelin..."
"House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday despite Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric, lawmakers are not prepared to form a deportation force to round-up and deport undocumented immigrants.
""We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that,"" Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."""
"President-elect Joe Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office, in a sign of how Biden's approach to the virus will be dramatically different from President Donald Trump's response.
""Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction,"" Biden said for the first time in the interview with Tapper.
The wide-ranging conversation with Biden, his first joint interview with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris since..."
"Police fired chemical agents to clear Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., on Monday night after protesters attempted — and failed — to pull down a huge statue of Andrew Jackson located there.
The famous statue of the seventh president on a rearing horse sits opposite the North Portico of the White House. The park has been the scene of anti-racist protests since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.
Protesters removed a chain-link fence that had recently been placed around the statue and climbed its base to..."
"Protesters attempted to topple a bronze statue of President Andrew Jackson in a park next to the White House on Monday night but were thwarted when police intervened.
The scene unfolded dramatically as hundreds of demonstrators protesting police brutality locked arms around the statue in Lafayette Square shortly before 8 p.m., while chanting, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Andrew Jackson’s got to go.”
Inside the metal pickets surrounding the statue, a smaller group — some clad in black with goggles, helmets and gas masks — scaled the statue and draped ropes..."
"It’s about time, even if it’s been a very long 22 years.
It was 1998 when Microsoft finally landed in the cross hairs of the federal government, when the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general alleged in an antitrust lawsuit that the software giant had abused its market power to crush competition. It was the last time the government took meaningful action against the unfettered rise of a tech behemoth.
The Big Tech companies that have sprouted up since the Microsoft case have been treated by government as if..."
"The law that transformed sports for women and girls is turning 50. 
On June 23, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed into law Title IX, prohibiting sex-based discrimination in schools, as part of sweeping reforms to the education system. When the law passed, just over 300,000 young women played college and high school sports. Forty years later, six times as many women and girls were competing at the high school and college level. By 2016, one in every five girls in the United States played sports. The law essentially created women’s professional sports as..."
"George Floyd, the Minnesota man who died after an officer arresting him pressed his knee onto his neck, died by homicide, according to the results of two autopsies released on Monday — one by the county medical examiner and the other by independent pathologists commissioned by Floyd's family. But the two autopsy reports differed on exactly how the man died.
Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy, said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation.
But the report released later..."
"MINNEAPOLIS – Both the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office and an autopsy commissioned by George Floyd's family have ruled that the death of Floyd – in an incident that has triggered nationwide unrest – was a homicide and the 46-year-old's heart stopped beating while police restrained him and compressed his neck.
The medical examiner's report released Monday listed ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression"" as the cause of death. It came hours after Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump held a press conference to announce the..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) shifted her public position Wednesday on banning lawmakers and their spouses from owning and trading individual stocks, saying more readily that she would support a ban if members of her caucus wanted to do so.
In December, Pelosi had swiftly shot down the idea that lawmakers and their spouses should not trade individual stocks while in Congress.
“We’re a free-market economy,” Pelosi told reporters then. “They should be able to participate in that.”"
"Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently called her top Republican counterpart Kevin McCarthy a ""moron,"" while McCarthy joked — maybe? — that he'd hit Pelosi with a gavel.
Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, has accused his Democratic peer, the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of ""angry incompetence"" either belying weakness or a tendency to bully. Schumer has chided McConnell as a Vladimir Putin toady who's personally responsible for, in his estimation, almost pushing Americans over a cliff to financial ruin."
"An Illinois city has become the first in America to embark upon a reparations program for its Black residents after its local council approved the implementation of its first such initiative to tackle the legacy of slavery.
Late on Monday night aldermen in Evanston – a suburban community in Chicago – voted to approve the Local Reparations Restorative Housing Program, a $400,000 housing grant program.
Designed to address the inequality gap and ongoing impact of slavery on African Americans in the city, Evanston’s reparations program will be funded with sales..."
"It’s not often President Barack Obama gives a speech centered on agriculture, but the three years of scorching drought in California prompted him to fly there Friday to speak to weary farmers and ranchers and pledge millions of dollars worth of aid.
“As anyone in this state could tell you, California is living through some of its driest years in a century,” Obama said after touring a farm and a water facility."
"Warning that weather-related disasters will only get worse, President Barack Obama said Friday the U.S. must rethink the way it uses water as he announced new federal aid to help drought-stricken California.
Obama drew a clear connection between California's troubles and climate change as he toured part of a farm that will go unsown this year as the state faces its worst drought in more than 100 years. Even if the U.S. takes action now to curb pollution, the planet will keep getting warmer ""for a long time to come""..."
"President Trump does not plan to invoke executive privilege to try to prevent James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, from providing potentially damaging testimony to Congress on statements the president made about an investigation into his former national security adviser, two senior administration officials said Friday."
"More than 90 countries have signed the Global Methane Pledge, which requires a 30 percent cut in methane emissions by 2030, one of the Biden administration’s priorities for the current climate summit in Glasgow. The pledge’s signatories now include six of the 10 largest methane emitters and about 45 percent of global methane emissions.
The Biden administration also unveiled a sweeping set of domestic policies Tuesday to cut emissions of methane from oil and gas operations across the United States. The proposals, announced at the U.N. climate summit known as COP26, represent one..."

As CNN wrote:

"Donald Trump is tightening his grip on the Republican Party in the most painful way possible — he’s threatening to starve the GOP of funding.
Just in the past few weeks, Trump declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference that the “only” way to give to Trump-aligned candidates was through Save America, his leadership political action committee, circumventing the party campaign arms devoted to electing Republicans. He has criticized the party for how it spends donor money, and his attorneys have sent cease-and-desist letters to GOP committees demanding they stop..."
"The latest Trump-versus-The-Establishment skirmish is over one of the things couples fight about most.
Money.
""No more money for RINOS,"" former President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday night, using the acronym for ""Republicans In Name Only,"" which is what conservatives call Republicans they deem not sufficiently conservative.

"A New York judge on Monday held Donald J. Trump in contempt of court for failing to turn over documents to the state’s attorney general, an extraordinary rebuke of the former president.
The judge, Arthur F. Engoron, ordered Mr. Trump to comply with a subpoena seeking records and assessed a fine of $10,000 per day until he satisfied the court’s requirements. In essence, the judge concluded that Mr. Trump had failed to cooperate with the attorney general, Letitia James, and follow the court’s orders.
“Mr. Trump: I know you take..."
"Four states have passed “heartbeat bills,” and Alabama is close to banning most abortions completely, a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade.
This year, with the future of Roe v. Wade newly in question after the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a rash of abortion-related bills have been making their way through statehouses. The vast majority are bills to restrict access to abortion, though a couple are efforts to shore up abortion rights.
This week, Georgia and Alabama have made moves to restrict access to the..."
"The Alabama Senate fell into chaos Thursday after the lieutenant governor removed from consideration two amendments that created rape and incest exceptions in a bill that would create a near-total ban on abortion.
The move by Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth led to anger from Senate Democrats, who demanded a vote on whether to keep the amendments in, and ultimately led to a delay in the bill itself.
The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Terri Collins, a Republican from Decatur, would ban abortion in nearly all cases except when a woman's..."
"A Florida high-rise that collapsed early Thursday was determined to be on unstable land a year ago, according to a researcher at Florida International University.
The building, which was constructed in 1981, has been sinking at an alarming rate since the 1990s, according to a study in 2020 by Shimon Wdowinski, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment.
When Wdowinski saw the news that the Champlain Towers South condominium in Surfside collapsed, he instantly remembered it from the study, he said.
“I looked at it this morning and said, ‘Oh my god.’..."
"The board president of the collapsed high-rise near Miami warned residents two months before the deadly tragedy that parts of the building’s infrastructure were seriously decaying, according to a letter obtained by multiple media outlets Tuesday. 
In the letter dated April 9, Surfside’s Champlain Towers South’s condominium association president Jean Wodnicki explained to residents why an assessed $15 million in repairs to the building was necessary. 
“The concrete deterioration is accelerating,” she wrote, noting that the damage was expected to “multiply exponentially” in the coming years. “When you can visually..."
"The Trump administration is looking at options for unilateral actions it can take to try to address some of the economic fallout caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic if no relief deal is reached with Congress, according to two people with knowledge of the deliberations.
The discussions are a reflection of officials’ increasingly pessimistic outlook for the talks on Capitol Hill. The White House remains in close contact with Democratic leaders, but a wide gulf remains and deadlines have already been missed.
It’s not clear what steps the administration could..."
"The White House is exploring whether President Donald Trump can act on his own to extend enhanced unemployment benefits and eviction protection if lawmakers fail to act, people familiar with the matter said.
The White House is concerned about the economic impact of the $600 a week supplemental benefits having expired on Friday, the people said, as Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach an agreement over a new coronavirus stimulus package.
It wasn’t immediately clear how Trump would be able to accomplish either goal without Congress acting. The..."
"The House approved President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue plan in a 219 to 212 vote early Saturday morning, sending the measure to the Senate as Democrats race to pass it into law before boosted unemployment payments expire next month.
All but two Democrats supported the sprawling coronavirus relief package, with zero Republicans backing it — a major step toward enacting the White House’s first major legislative priority amid dueling public health and economic crises."
"As the number of new coronavirus cases in his state soars, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is betting that an aggressive campaign against mandatory mask-wearing in schools will harden the Republican base ahead of his expected re-election bid next year -- and make him a GOP star nationwide as the party's 2024 presidential primary comes into view.
The gamble appears to be paying off -- for now. DeSantis is a Fox News darling and relishes the intensifying backlash from Democrats, especially President Joe Biden, who has criticized the governor and other Republican state executives for..."
"Democrats and Republicans in Congress came out swinging against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google on Wednesday, needling the tech giants’ top executives over their size, power and approach to a wide array of issues, including the content they allow online.
Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House’s top antitrust subcommittee, opened the wide-ranging hearing by stressing that lawmakers’ year-long investigation into the industry had informed his growing belief that the country’s largest technology companies have “wielded their power in disruptive, harmful ways,” risking not only competition but..."
"The Build Back Better framework unveiled by the White House on Thursday revises key climate change proposals, keeps funding for universal pre-kindergarten and jettisons earlier plans to provide paid family and medical leave.
The changes come after months of negotiations between moderates, progressives and the White House over the components of a massive social safety net package.
Here's a look at what's new, what's out and what was kept intact in the $1.75 trillion package that's now half the size of the initial proposal from President Joe Biden.

"U.S. employers added a modest 199,000 jobs last month while the unemployment rate fell sharply, at a time when businesses are struggling to fill jobs with many Americans remaining reluctant to return to the workforce.
At the same time, Friday’s jobs report from the Labor Department showed that the nation’s unemployment rate fell from 4.2% to a healthy 3.9%, evidence that many more people found jobs last month. Indeed, despite the slight hiring gain reported by businesses, 651,000 more people said they were employed in December compared with November.

"With civilian hospitals increasingly overwhelmed and the coronavirus outbreak in America deepening, a question is coming up of whether there’s a bigger role the US military to play in responding.
President Donald Trump isn’t so sure, yet.
“We’re starting the process. And it’s a process — we hope it’s not going to be necessary, but it could be necessary,” he said during the White House briefing on Tuesday morning.
Hours later, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon would at least offer some support. He told reporters that his department..."

"The Democratic presidential candidates are racing toward the biggest day on the primary calendar, when 14 states vote on Super Tuesday. It’s the day when the primary moves from retail to wholesale. Instead of one state voting at a time, candidates have to focus on contests in every region of the country with all types of voters.
While Super Tuesday won’t necessarily determine who wins the nomination, it has historically been difficult for a candidate who performs poorly on the day to recover. Here’s a look at Tuesday’s contests: THE..."

"SELMA, Ala. (AP) — John Lewis saw the line of Alabama state troopers a few hundred yards away as he led hundreds of marchers to the apex of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965. Armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, the troopers were flanked by horse-riding members of the sheriff’s posse. A crowd of whites milled around nearby.
Lewis, who died Friday at age 80, was just 25 at the time. He had been leading voting rights demonstrations for months in the notoriously racist town, and..."
"Sometimes I wonder if history is trying to tell us something.
July 17, for example. In the morning came news of the death of C.T. Vivian. At night, the news that Rep. John R. Lewis (D-Ga.) passed away. Two men linked by decades of struggle, success and the deep truth that struggle itself is a kind of success. They met long ago, in the days of tiny television sets and black ribbon neckties and automobiles with fins stamped from sheet metal.
Around 1960, Vivian and Lewis were students together in..."
"President Barack Obama on Wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school massacre last month.
With relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the Connecticut rampage looking on, Obama signed 23 executive actions that don't require congressional approval that he said would strengthen background checks and expand safety programs in schools."
"President Obama on Wednesday formally proposed the most expansive gun-control policies in generations and initiated 23 separate executive actions aimed at curbing what he called “the epidemic of gun violence in this country.
While no legislation can prevent every tragedy, he said in announcing the proposals, “if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if theres eve"
"When Brian Kemp’s top donors huddled with the Georgia governor and his lieutenants at Atlanta’s Capital City Club earlier this year, they had reason to worry that his political career was about to come to an end.
Former President Donald Trump had spent the previous year savaging the Republican governor for refusing to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results, and he was bent on ousting the governor from office, recruiting and endorsing Kemp’s primary opponent. Few Republicans in recent years had survived Trump’s wrath. But the Kemp team reassured the nearly..."
"A federal judge has granted former President Donald Trump's request to appoint a ""special master"" to review materials that the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago last month.
The decision, from Trump-appointed District Judge Aileen Cannon, is a significant victory for the former President, who has railed against the Biden administration and Justice Department since the search was executed four weeks ago.
""As a function of Plaintiff's former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own,"" Cannon wrote. ""A future indictment, based..."
"One million dollars to build a bus stop in Virginia. Five million for customized crystal stemware. Those are just some of the items paid for by the federal government last year. A new report out Tuesday by a prominent Republican senator, called the ""Wastebook,"" details $30 billion in questionable spending."
"President Trump grinned and gave a thumbs up as he strutted to the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday, hoping to shift public attention from his Senate impeachment trial to the signing of a long-promised trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
But even as he made good on his 2016 campaign pledge to replace NAFTA — once Canada ratifies the deal — he kept bringing up impeachment.
Before signing the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA, Trump joked to Republican senators at the crowded ceremony that he was..."
"Republicans are eager to decry a “Biden border crisis.” But the current wave of migration at the southern border is the result of a humanitarian crisis in Central America that has been years in the making.
Citizens of the “Northern Triangle” region — Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador — have long suffered from gang-related violence, frequent extortion, government corruption, and high levels of poverty. Over the past few months, though, another factor has added an additional push to make the dangerous journey north: continuing devastation from back-to-back hurricanes."
"A growing number of Republicans are openly scoffing at President Donald Trump's handling of national security issues, with the Senate's number two Republican bashing Trump's criticism on Wednesday of the heads of the US intelligence community ahead of a vote on a measure disapproving Trump's Middle East policy."
"A fiery leftist, Hugo Chavez was a steadfast ally of dictators like Cuba's Fidel Castro while loudly opposing the United States. He claimed capitalism was destroying the world and tried to transform Venezuela into a socialist state. Millions of Venezuelans loved him because he showered the poor with social programs.
Yet Chavez, who ruled Venezuela from 1999 until his death Tuesday, was not able to turn the country's oil wealth into broad-based prosperity. At various times, the country experienced high in"
"President Obama Addressed Health officials from Dozens of countries who HAD Gathered Friday at the White House to Determine Ways the International Community CAN Strengthen defenses Against Future Epidemics , SUCH as the Ebola Outbreak Now Raging in West Africa.
Administration officials HAD Launched a global Health Security Initiative in February to help develop Other Nations Basic disease detection and Monitoring Systems to CONTAIN the spread of Deadly Illnesses. The push to develop a long-Term Strategy GAINED Added Impetus in the Wake of the Ebola epidemic."
"When big legislation makes its way through Congress, peeling back the layers usually reveals the rot inside. Once they're brought into the light, we see why provisions were slipped into a bigger package. But that doesn't seem to be the case with the Covid-19 stimulus bill, which is set to pass the House on its way to President Joe Biden's desk on Wednesday. Instead, if you examine the $1.9 trillion relief package, you'll find more and more provisions designed to help people than were originally highlighted. Everyone has heard about..."
"If Congress returns too soon and lawmakers contract coronavirus, leaders could face backlash for not keeping members safe. But if Congress doesn’t get back to business, leaders could take heat for sitting on the sidelines in the middle of a crisis. Those are the competing pressures that the Senate and House are under as they make decisions about when — and how — to reopen.
So far, the chambers are taking divergent approaches. But the House will surely be keeping a close eye on operations in the Senate, which is..."
"On Thursday afternoon, 30 top TikTok stars gathered on a Zoom call to receive key information about the war unfolding in Ukraine. National Security Council staffers and White House press secretary Jen Psaki briefed the influencers about the United States’ strategic goals in the region and answered questions on distributing aid to Ukrainians, working with NATO and how the United States would react to a Russian use of nuclear weapons.
As the crisis in Ukraine has escalated, millions have turned to TikTok for information on what is happening there in real time...."
"President Joe Biden has granted the first three pardons of his term, providing clemency to a Kennedy-era Secret Service agent convicted of federal bribery charges that he tried to sell a copy of an agency file and to two people who were convicted on drug-related charges but went on to become pillars in their communities.
The Democratic president also commuted the sentences of 75 others for nonviolent, drug-related convictions. The White House announced the clemencies Tuesday as it launched a series of job training and reentry programs for those in prison..."
"President Joe Biden announced Tuesday morning that he has granted clemency to 78 individuals, all of whom were convicted of low-level drug offenses or nonviolent crimes. Three people were pardoned, and 75 received commutations of their sentences.
It’s the first time Biden has exercised his constitutional clemency powers as president. Many of the people granted commutations were convicted years ago of crimes that today carry much lighter sentences. In a call with reporters Monday evening, White House officials said that if the people who received clemency were charged or convicted of any..."
"Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said former President Donald Trump’s fate should be left in the hands of the Department of Justice and the federal courts over his role in allegedly inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection.
In an interview with ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, the senator said all Americans, even former presidents, are subject to the U.S. court system."
"The Trump administration announced Monday that it will begin formally withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord, the first step in a year-long process to leave the landmark agreement to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.
""Today the United States began the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. ""Per the terms of the Agreement, the United States submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations. The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification.""

"School communities desperate for normalcy are hoping that the new school year will be more stable than the last, when the coronavirus forced schools to close and launch remote learning overnight. But that seems like wishful thinking, as 2020-2021 is shaping up to be even more problematic.
School districts are embarking on novel experiments in learning, unveiling plans to reopen with new procedures for just about everything. But none of them are set in stone because the unknowns about how things will work far outweigh the knowns.
That heralds confusion..."
"The Biden administration on Monday formally accused the Chinese government of breaching Microsoft email systems used by many of the world’s largest companies, governments and military contractors, as the United States joined a broad group of allies, including all NATO members, to condemn Beijing for cyberattacks around the world.
The United States accused China for the first time of paying criminal groups to conduct large-scale hackings, including ransomware attacks to extort companies for millions of dollars, according to a statement from the White House. Microsoft had pointed to hackers linked to the..."
"On his way out of office, Trump distorts the Constitution to serve his ego and personal interests.
President Trump’s last-minute pardons betray what the Constitution’s pardon power is all about. While he has not decided to try to pardon himself (at least, not as far as we know), the pardons he issued during his term taken together serve as a microcosm for his presidency. They take a noble part of our Constitution and warp it in the service of Trump’s ego and future personal interests.
The Founders put the pardon..."
"President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly used his clemency authority as a political tool rather than an act of mercy, issued a final wave of pardons and commutations on his last night in office, delivering relief for a mix of beneficiaries that included former strategist Stephen Bannon, Republican Party and Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, found guilty in 2013 of corruption charges.
He granted pardons to 73 people and commuted the sentences of another 70 people, according to a news release from the White House...."
"Stocks and oil prices slid Tuesday coming off Independence Day weekend, amplifying the losses of Wall Street’s dismal first half and offering more warning signs of a coming downturn. Crude fell below $100 a barrel for the first time since May.
The Dow Jones Industrial tumbled more than 560 points or 1.9 percent in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 index fell by 60 points or 1.6 percent at midday Tuesday, while the tech heavy-Nasdaq lost 49 points or 0.4 percent."
"Fabian Castillo was suffering from crippling anxiety when his uncle handed him a marijuana vape pen one day last December.
""It will help calm you down,"" Castillo said his uncle told him.
Over the next several months, the vape worked as advertised. Castillo, who had just graduated high school in southern California, found himself more mellow and more productive.
He had no idea at the time that he was using, what he now believes, was a bootleg vape pen filled with a toxic mix of chemicals.
But on Aug. 2,..."
"The mystery of the outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses is still not solved.
But investigators in Illinois and Wisconsin have found some clues, they announced Friday in a press briefing.
Investigators in these two states conducted detailed interviews with 86 patients — mostly young men — and 66% said they had vaped THC products labeled as Dank Vapes. THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.
What are Dank Vapes and how could they be fueling the outbreak?
""Dank Vapes appears to be the most prominent in a class of largely..."
"The Justice Department is stepping back from a recommendation that Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, serve a stiff prison sentence following his conviction on charges of impeding congressional and FBI investigations into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
In an early-morning tweet Tuesday, Trump blasted federal prosecutors for urging a prison sentence of about seven to nine years for Stone, the veteran GOP political consultant and provocateur found guilty by a jury last year on seven felony counts brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller...."
"It looks like President Trump got his point across.
The Justice Department has decided to back off its earlier recommendation that Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone receive a sentencing of seven to nine years following his seven-count conviction last year for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing a House investigation into possible coordination between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. A department official confirmed the news to The Associated Press, describing the recommendation as ""extreme, excessive, and grossly disproportionate"" to Stone's offenses.
Upon learning about the initial recommendation, Trump..."
"Anthony Rapp has lost his civil lawsuit against Kevin Spacey, whom he accused of sexually assaulting him when Rapp was 14.
The jury deliberated for about one hour and 20 minutes on Thursday before finding that Rapp's attorneys did not prove that Spacey had touched his ""sexual or intimate part or parts."" During closing arguments earlier in the day, Spacey’s attorney Jennifer Keller accused Rapp of “trying to hitch his wagon to the #MeToo movement.”
Throughout the trial, the defense accused Rapp of lying due to jealousy of Spacey’s career..."
"Planned Parenthood's President Leana Wen was removed from the position on Tuesday after less than a year on the job.
In a statement on Twitter, Wen said the decision was made during a ""secret meeting.""
""I am leaving because the new Board Chairs and I have philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood,"" Wen said in a statement on Twitter."
"Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen was removed from her position by the organization’s board “at a secret meeting,” due to “philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood,” Wen said in a tweet Tuesday. She was in the position for less than a year.
“I believe that the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one,” Wen tweeted in a statement about her sudden termination."
"How do most of the people on your Twitter timeline feel about Ferguson? About foreign affairs? About the latest pop culture scandal? Except for that one weirdly conservative uncle or those random people to whom you never really spoke in high school, the answer is probably: a lot like you do. And if not, you aren’t going to tell them so.
A new study by the Pew Research Internet Project found that social media sites like Facebook and Twitter do not offer a platform for those hesitant to speak up..."
"The Associated Press doesn't question the Justice Department's right to have seized two months' worth of its phone records, the organization's president and CEO Gary Pruitt said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" It was the methodology - ""so sweeping, so secretively, so abusively and harassingly overbroad,"" he said - that breached the Constitution."
"A group of 18 scientists stated Thursday in a letter published in the journal Science that there is not enough evidence to decide whether a natural origin or an accidental laboratory leak caused the Covid-19 pandemic.
They argued, as the U.S. government and other countries have, for a new investigation to explore where the virus came from.
The organizers of the letter, Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University, said they strove..."
"Joe Biden embarked Wednesday on his first foreign trip as president, an eight-day swing across Europe that will give him a chance to shore up frayed alliances with U.S. allies and meet face to face with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid rising tensions with Moscow.
He’ll also get to enjoy one of the perks of the presidency: a visit with Queen Elizabeth II.
Biden, who has been on the world stage for nearly five decades as senator, vice president and now president, has hosted the leaders of Japan and South Korea at the White House since taking office Jan...."
"Joe Biden is heading abroad, just at the moment when his hopes for a historic legislative legacy at home seem headed for a wall.
For all the talk among Democrats of Biden assembling a Rooseveltian legacy, the moment was always going to come when his vast political agenda would hit the blockade of Washington's uncompromising political math.
Recent days have chastened Democrats who dreamed of using what may be a brief two-year window of congressional power to forge the most fundamental economic and political change for a generation.
Biden had a strong start..."
"Israel's Security Cabinet unanimously rejected a cease-fire proposal Friday that called for a week-long truce in the deadly conflict.
The proposal by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for a temporary pause in fighting to allow Israelis and Palestinians to broker a broader deal. Israeli TV reported the deal was rejected mainly because Israel would have to cut short its effort at destroying Hamas tunnels.
""The agony of events on the ground in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel, all of them together, simply cannot be overstated,"" Kerry said..."
"A last-ditch effort by the U.N. chief and the U.S. secretary of state to broker a temporary Gaza truce was thrown into doubt Friday, as Israeli media reported that Israel's Security Cabinet rejected the plan.
The proposal by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calls for a week-long pause in Israel-Hamas fighting. During this time, the two sides would begin indirect talks on easing the border closure of the blockaded Gaza Strip.
Hamas has demanded that Gaza's crossings be opened. Israel and Egypt imposed the Gaza closure in 2007, after..."
"Russian bounties offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months.
Several people familiar with the matter said it was unclear exactly how many Americans or coalition troops from other countries may have been killed or targeted under the program. U.S. forces in Afghanistan suffered a total of 10 deaths from hostile gunfire or improvised bombs in 2018, and 16 in 2019...."
"Members of the House Intelligence Committee will begin reviewing a report Monday on the panel's investigation of President Donald Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic adversaries, a crucial step in the House's fast-moving impeachment inquiry.
Lawmakers on the panel will get a 24-hour review period, according to internal guidance sent to committee members and obtained by POLITICO. On Tuesday, the panel is expected to approve the findings — likely on a party-line vote — teeing it up for consideration by the Judiciary Committee, which is in turn..."
"President Trump is expected to unveil a new executive order on Thursday afternoon that expands the private-sector version of Medicare, framing the decision as the responsible alternative to the Medicare-for-All policies supported by some of his Democratic political opponents.
Seniors “like what they have, so the president is going to protect it,” Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a conference call with reporters ahead of Mr. Trump’s afternoon speech. “Today’s executive order makes very clear his commitment to protecting Medicare.”
The executive order,..."
"A new cease-fire is set to begin Sunday in eastern Ukraine, in a deal after 16 hours of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The leaders of France and Germany helped broker the deal, which calls for a buffer zone free of heavy weapons. News of the temporary peace emerged along with a new international aid plan for Ukraine."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department has completed its internal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of private email and found violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action.
The investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were “culpable” in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton’s personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released Friday. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were..."
"A multiyear State Department probe of emails that were sent to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s private computer server concluded there was no systemic or deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees, according to a report submitted to Congress this month.
The report appears to represent a final and anticlimactic chapter in a controversy that overshadowed the 2016 presidential campaign and exposed Clinton to fierce criticism that she later cited as a major factor in her loss to President Trump."

""They were overwhelmed to begin with. There is much that needs to be done to correct the situation.""
While Pelosi..."
"""Obamacare"" escaped unharmed from the government shutdown Republicans hoped would stop it, but just as quickly they have opened a new line of attack — one handed to them by the administration itself.
While Congress was arguing, President Barack Obama's plan to expand coverage for the uninsured suffered a self-inflicted wound. A computer system seemingly designed by gremlins gummed up the first open enrollment season. After nearly three weeks, it's still not fixed.
Republicans hope to ride that and other defects they see in the law into the 2014 congressional..."
"A Norwegian far-right MP has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel peace prize for a second time, citing his role in the normalising of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
Christian Tybring-Gjedde told Fox News: “For his merit, I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other peace prize nominees.”
Trump responded to news of his nomination for the 2021 prize by expressing his thanks on Twitter.
The bar for being nominated for the prize is low, as nominations are accepted from..."
"A far-right Norwegian lawmaker said Wednesday that he has nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Middle East.
Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of the Norwegian Parliament for the far-right Progress Party, said Trump should be considered because of his work “for a peace agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel which opens up for possible peace in the Middle East.”
Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed last month to a historic deal normalizing relations and are scheduled to sign it at..."
"Today, probably “later this afternoon,” according to a spokeswoman, the New York City Board of Elections will post new primary election returns, tabulated according to the rules of ranked-choice voting.
If all of this feels like déjà vu, that’s because this will be the second day in a row that the Board of Elections will have run the ranked-choice voting algorithm.
Yesterday, the Board ran the algorithm, posted the results, and then, following hours of comments from mayoral candidates and questions from reporters, abruptly took them down from its website, acknowledging on Twitter it..."
"The New York City mayoral election was thrown into disarray Tuesday night after the Board of Elections acknowledged a ""discrepancy"" in the calculation of ranked choice votes, showing 135,000 ""test"" votes  had been added into the count.
The race between Brooklyn borough President Eric Adams and his rivals appeared to narrow significantly after the partial results were released Tuesday afternoon, but hours later the Board removed the tally from its website and said there were issues with it. 
Approximately 135,000 additional votes, added into the Board's computer software for testing purposes, were never removed before..."
"Facebook’s stock went up after news of a record-breaking $5 billion FTC fine for various privacy violations broke today.
That, as The New York Times’ Mike Isaac points out, is the real story here: the United States government spent months coming up with a punishment for Facebook’s long list of privacy-related bad behavior, and the best it could do was so weak that Facebook’s stock price went up."
"Mass shootings have become so common in the US that we have developed a pathology for how to react. The aggrieved families who have lost someone they loved are the recipients of thoughts and prayers. Law enforcement is praised for keeping the tragedy from becoming even more horrific. Counseling is offered to survivors. Politicians come to town to express their sympathy and outrage, and vow that the latest community will recover and stand “Texas strong” or “Sandy Hook strong” or “Parkland strong.”
But nothing happens to prevent another shooting.

"The Biden administration has handled the Ukraine crisis intelligently and effectively, formulating a policy that could be described as “deterrence plus diplomacy.” It made credible threats about the costs of a Russian invasion and rallied its European allies in an impressive show of unity. And while (correctly) refusing to promise that Ukraine will be barred from NATO, it has offered to discuss almost everything else, from arms control to missile deployments.
This crisis, however, has highlighted a larger strategic failure, one that extends beyond this administration. One of the central rules of strategy is to divide your adversaries...."
"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz announced Monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 Republican nominee for president. Cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012. His announcement takes place at a bastion of conservatism, Liberty University, the institution founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell."
"Senator Bernie Sanders routed Hillary Clinton in all three Democratic presidential contests on Saturday, infusing his underdog campaign with critical momentum and bolstering his argument that the race for the nomination is not a foregone conclusion.
Mr. Sanders found a welcome tableau in the largely white and liberal electorates of the Pacific Northwest, where just days after resoundingly beating Mrs. Clinton in Idaho he repeated the feat in the Washington caucuses, winning 73 percent of the vote. He did even better in Alaska, winning 82 percent of the vote, and..."
"Saturday was a big day for Bernie Sanders' quest for the Democratic presidential nomination as he swept to resounding victories in the caucus states of Hawaii, Washington and Alaska. But the delegate math is still in Hillary Clinton's favor. ""We knew things were going to improve as we headed West,"" Sanders said at a jubilant rally before 8,000 people in Madison, Wisconsin -- a state that will hold the next major contest in 10 days. ""We have a path toward victory."""
"Normally, a scandal centered on how rich parents used bribes to win their children’s admittance into elite colleges wouldn’t play so heavily in the national news. No one much cared when Donald Trump promised large donations as his children enrolled at Penn. But the outrage over the Varsity Blues investigation perfectly illustrates what may be the most important, least understood, and underappreciated political dynamic of our era: a full-on middle-class revolt against the elites and the privileges they hoard. For all the focus on inequality and social justice, this middle-class..."
"President Biden has approved the deployment of about 3,000 additional American troops to Eastern Europe, administration officials said on Wednesday.
The troops, including 1,000 already in Germany, will head to Poland and Romania, the Pentagon spokesman, John F. Kirby, said. Their purpose will be to reassure NATO allies that while the United States has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, where President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been threatening an invasion, Mr. Biden would protect America’s NATO allies from any Russian aggression."
"Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) admonished President Trump on Tuesday to stop interfering in the debate over tax legislation and said his volatility could lead the United States into war, prompting a slew of Twitter insults from the president and renewing a long-simmering feud just hours before he is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill."
"Student-loan borrowers can now officially apply for President Joe Biden's one-time debt relief.
On Monday, Biden announced that the site to apply for student-loan forgiveness is officially live, following a beta test of the website conducted over the weekend. This means that the Education Department will begin processing applications as borrowers apply for up to $20,000 in debt relief through a form on studentaid.gov that requires just basic information, like a borrower's name, email address, and Social Security number.
""It landed and handled more than 8 million applications without a glitch or any difficulty,""..."
"The November jobs report looked disappointing at first glance, but the details show that the recovery is very much moving along.
US employers added another 210,000 jobs to the economy in November, far fewer than expected, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. It was the smallest number of jobs added to the US economy since December 2020, when the economy actually shed jobs amid a surge in Covid cases.
Economists had expected more than double the number of jobs created in November, forecasting a continuation of the buoyant economic recovery over the past two months...."
"America’s unemployment rate tumbled last month to its lowest point since the pandemic struck, even as employers appeared to slow their hiring — a mixed picture that pointed to a resilient economic rebound that’s putting more people to work.
The government reported Friday that private businesses and other employers added just 210,000 jobs in November, the weakest monthly gain in nearly a year and less than half of October’s gain of 546,000.
But other data from the Labor Department’s report painted a much brighter picture. The unemployment rate plummeted from 4.6% to..."
"Hillary Rodham Clinton easily parried barbed Republican questioning Thursday about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, emerging unscathed from a high-stakes congressional hearing with a smooth and sometimes poignant account of her role in the event that has loomed as among her largest political liabilities."
"Among the many silly, mind-numbing, agenda-pushing exchanges happening on Twitter at any given moment, the one playing out between the President of the United States and the world's second-richest person stands out for both its dullness and its deliberate oversimplification.
If you've been away from Twitter lately, first of all: Good on you. Here's a quick recap of the dispute between Jeff Bezos and President Joe Biden.
On Friday, Biden tweeted that the way to bring down inflation is to ""make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share."""
"A bipartisan group of Senate negotiators say they have reached a deal on a package of safety and gun-related measures narrowly focused on preventing future shootings similar to the one in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were killed in their school.
The proposal, which has not been written into legislative text, includes money to encourage states to pass and implement so-called ""red flag"" laws to remove guns from potentially dangerous people, money for school safety and mental health resources, expanded background checks for gun purchases for people..."
"The State Department said on Sunday that it had ordered family members of U.S. Embassy personnel in Kyiv, Ukraine, to leave the country amid increasing concerns about a possible Russian invasion.
The embassy will remain open for now, senior State Department officials said in a briefing with reporters, but some diplomats have been authorized to depart as well.
The State Department also cited the possibility of Russian military action in keeping its travel risk advisory at Level 4, the highest category, urging U.S. citizens to not travel to Ukraine. The..."
"The State Department on Sunday ordered the families of all American personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine to leave the country amid heightened fears of a Russian invasion.
The department told the dependents of staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv that they must leave the country. It also said that non-essential embassy staff could leave Ukraine at government expense.
The move came amid rising tensions about Russia’s military buildup on the Ukraine border that were not eased during talks Friday between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian..."
"Donald Trump promised Friday night that if elected president, he will win 95 percent of the African-American vote in his reelection bid.
Renewing his effort to reach out to black voters at a rally Friday evening, Trump suggested that Democratic politicians that overwhelmingly govern in America’s inner cities have failed African-Americans. Trump told the Dimondale, Michigan, crowd that “we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place. A new future requires brand-new leadership.”"
"It’s quite possible that, by the end of this week, we could be having yet another hugely important political debate over the definition of a word: “recession.”
The Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday is set to release the second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers. And if they’re negative, that will mark two consecutive quarters in which the economy has contracted — something that is generally understood to mean a recession.
How real and politically sensitive is that possibility? Real enough that the Biden administration is seeking to preempt it."
"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump lashed again Tuesday at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats involved in his impeachment after a teleconference in which he exchanged holiday greetings with members of the military stationed around the globe from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
“She hates the Republican Party,” Trump said of Pelosi, predicting that she would lose her speakership. “She hates all of the people who voted for me and the Republican Party. … She’s doing a tremendous disservice to the country.”
Speaking to reporters who had..."
"Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits dropped for a fourth consecutive week, a trend that suggests labor market conditions are improving as the economy recovers.
Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs dropped 29,000 to 348,000 in the week ended Aug. 14, a pandemic low, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a decline to 364,000.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 2.8 million in the week ended Aug. 7, also the lowest since the pandemic began.
The decrease in initial claims points..."
"President Joe Biden is calling on Congress to pass new gun control measures after mass shootings in the last week in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado.
In a short speech Tuesday afternoon, Biden said “we can save lives” by increasing background checks for gun purchases, banning assault weapons, and limiting the size of magazines. Speaking directly to the families of those killed in Atlanta last Tuesday and in Boulder on Monday, Biden said the US government must “act so there’s not more of you, there’s fewer of you, as time goes..."
"Sometimes, it seems as if fate is trying to prove its unlimited capacity for cruelty. When the skies over Beirut exploded on Tuesday, sending shockwaves felt all the way to Cyprus, 150 miles away in the Mediterranean, and devastating much of a city that was once known as the Paris of the Middle East, it seemed one of those times.
But the never-ending tragedy that is Lebanon is not the result of the random doings of destiny.
Lebanon's government has blamed a large quantity of poorly stored ammonium nitrate for..."
"For those following the Jeffrey Epstein story, the past two years have felt like driving around a curve that never ends. Answers to the key questions at the heart of the vast scandal have seemed tantalizingly close and frustratingly out of reach. How did the late pedophile earn his estimated half-billion-dollar fortune? Which powerful men participated in his sex-trafficking ring? What about all those surveillance videos from inside his homes? On November 29, lawyers are set to deliver opening statements in the highly anticipated trial of Epstein’s alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. For..."
"At least one protester was taken to the hospital after being struck by a vehicle during a demonstration in Hollywood on Thursday night.
Video posted to social media shows a blue truck striking a protester who was holding a sign, knocking the person to the ground. The incident happened after the driver became involved in an altercation while maneuvering through the crowd of more than 300 protesters, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Some of them raised their fists and called out “Black lives matter!” Others tended to the letters, flowers and signs grouped together in a square in downtown Louisville. All of them said her name: Breonna Taylor.
People dismayed that the officers who shot the Black woman in her apartment during a drug raid last March wouldn’t be charged with her death vowed to persist in their fight for justice. The big question for a town torn apart by Taylor’s death and the larger issue of racism..."
"June is Pride Month, when the world's LGBTQ communities come together and celebrate the freedom to be themselves.
Pride gatherings are rooted in the arduous history of minority groups who have struggled for decades to overcome prejudice and be accepted for who they are.
The original organizers chose this month to pay homage to the Stonewall uprising in June 1969 in New York City, which helped spark the modern gay rights movement. Most Pride events take place each year in June, although some cities hold their celebrations at other times of the year."
"During Pride Month, we celebrate our stories: stories of our elders who fought so hard to realize the progress many never got to see, stories of our chosen families, our own stories of coming out, of falling in love, of finding healing in community. 
As the interim president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organization, I get to hear so many powerful stories directly from folks in our community. And this Pride Month, I need you to hear these stories as well: stories of trans and..."
"President Donald Trump is the most admired man in America.
That’s according to Gallup, which — on Tuesday — released its annual survey tracking the most admired man. Trump edged out former President Barack Obama for the honor, with 18 percent of respondents naming the current commander in chief as their pick, compared to 15 percent opting for his predecessor.
Ordinarily, the sitting president tends to perform very well in this poll. In the 74 years, Gallup has conducted its most admired survey, the current president has topped the list..."
"President Donald Trump voiced strong support Thursday for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, raising speculation that a pardon may be coming after Flynn’s lawyers disclosed internal FBI documents they claim show the FBI tried to “intentionally frame” him.
Trump said he believes Flynn should now be cleared in court, but if that doesn’t happen he as president has “a different type of power.”
“It looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I see,” Trump said at the White House. “I’m not the judge,..."
"President Trump’s allies cheered new documents unsealed on Wednesday in the criminal case of his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, saying that internal investigative notes showed that Mr. Flynn was set up by F.B.I. officials intent on undermining the president.
It will be up to a federal judge to decide if the notes and emails advance claims that Mr. Flynn was framed when he lied to the F.B.I. in January 2017 about his conversations with a Russian diplomat, a felony he twice pleaded guilty to.
The documents show..."
"High drug and health care costs continue to prevent millions of Americans from achieving full health. Nearly 1 in 2 American adults report difficulty affording health care costs. It’s no wonder that voters consistently rank bringing down prescription drug prices and other measures to reduce the cost of care as among Congress’ top priorities.
The Inflation Reduction Act, when passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Joe Biden, will give a lifeline to people struggling with health costs by providing much-needed financial relief for the health coverage and medications they need to survive..."
"A suspect surrendered just after midnight after shooting six police officers in a north Philadelphia neighborhood Wednesday evening, igniting a standoff that dragged on for hours in what authorities called a hostage situation.
The suspect is Maurice Hill, a 36-year-old Philadelphia resident with a history of gun convictions, his former lawyer, Shaka Johnson, told The Washington Post. Philadelphia Police Sgt. Eric Gripp said on Twitter early Thursday that the suspect is in custody.
Johnson said he did not know Hill’s motive. He said Hill would likely face several charges from..."
"Throughout a seven-hour gun battle that turned a Philadelphia neighborhood into a war-zone and left six officers injured, the goal was ""preservation of life,"" police commissioner Richard Ross said, explaining a day of intense gunfire and tear gas salvos before the gunman surrendered early Thursday.
At one point, with hundreds of officers pinned down by erratic gunfire, a SWAT team rescued two officers trapped upstairs with handcuffed prisoners in the north Philadelphia home.
In the end, the police tactics worked as the shooter, with his hands up, was driven..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is moving forward on a set of impeachment trial rules without Democratic support.
The Kentucky Republican said Tuesday he has locked down sufficient backing in his 53-member caucus to pass a blueprint for the trial that leaves the question of seeking witnesses and documents until after opening arguments are made.
That framework would mirror the contours of President Bill Clinton’s trial and ignore Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s demands for witnesses and new evidence at the outset.
“We have the votes once the impeachment trial..."
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was again named the most admired woman in the world in an annual Gallup poll released Monday.
Clinton has taken the title 17 of the last 18 years. In 2001, then-first lady Laura Bush took the title.
President Barack Obama took the title of most admired man again this year, topping the list for the seventh consecutive year."
"SACRAMENTO — The day after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced extraordinary measures directing all Californias to stay at home amid the coronavirus outbreak, Contra Costa County on Friday announced its first death related to the virus.
The person was in their 70s, had an underlying medical condition and had recently traveled overseas, officials said. The patient died Thursday in an undisclosed hospital, becoming the 20th person to die of the virus in California."
"Shortly after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart and shopping mall in El Paso, a shaken Beto O’Rourke took the stage at a labor forum in Las Vegas.
The Democratic presidential hopeful and former congressman, who lives in the Texas border city, told the audience that he had just called his wife to make sure she was okay. He said the shooting shatters “any illusion that we have that progress is inevitable” when it comes to tackling gun violence."
"The Senate voted by the slimmest of margins Thursday to begin debating a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, after Democrats made eleventh-hour changes aimed at ensuring they could pull President Joe Biden’s top legislative priority through the precariously divided chamber.
Democrats were hoping for Senate approval of the package before next week, in time for the House to sign off and get the measure to Biden quickly. They were encountering opposition from Republicans arguing that the measure’s massive price tag ignored promising signs that the pandemic and wounded economy were..."
"In Obergefell v. Hodges, the US Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on Tuesday, April 28, over whether states' same-sex marriage bans are constitutional, setting the stage for a final decision on the issue by the end of June. Although the cases deal with laws in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee specifically, the Court's decision could bring marriage equality to the entire US by striking down all states' same-sex marriage bans.
The same-sex marriage battle has been more than a decade in the making — going back to the early..."
"A Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 American adults conducted in April found that 53 percent of Republicans were willing to take anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, while only 18 percent of Democrats were willing to try it.
The utter arbitrariness of how public opinion on scientific questions has fractured along partisan divides reveals something rotten at the core of the national conversation.
No one is surprised to see political polarization around issues of taxation, immigration, welfare or military spending. But it has been remarkable to see such deep partisan divides..."
"The violence in Iraq has intensified today, with al-Qaida-linked Sunni militants moving into areas close to Baghdad after capturing the cities of Mosul and Tikrit. And amid this chaos, there's a new report that the U.S. rebuffed Iraqi requests last month to conduct airstrikes against the advancing militants, and that Kurdish fighters have taken territory in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk"
"Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the newly chosen vice presidential running mate for Republican Mitt Romney, was in Ohio on Wednesday to speak at his alma mater.
Ryan graduated from Miami University of Ohio in 1992 with degrees in economics and political science. And his ascension to the GOP ticket thrills Rob Harrelson, a member of the school's College Republicans (as was Ryan, two decades earlier).
""He's young. He's energetic. He's popular. He's rising through the ranks of the Republican Party and in the House,"" says Harrelson. ""I think he's..."
"Former South Carolina governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley stepped in it on Friday afternoon after making the bizarre claim that the Confederate flag was a symbol of “service, and sacrifice, and heritage” until convicted murderer Dylann Roof “hijacked” it.
During an interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, Haley stated, ““Here is this guy who comes out with this manifesto, holding the Confederate flag. And [he] had just hijacked everything that people thought of. We don’t have hateful people in South Carolina — there’s always the small minority,..."
"It is not yet clear which Republican presidential candidate will emerge from Saturday’s South Carolina primary with the biggest boost. But it is becoming increasingly apparent which two would suffer most from a disappointing performance.
South Carolina will render a brutal and perhaps final verdict on Jeb Bush’s campaign if he does not at least finish close to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has made an all-out push here, campaigning ag"
"If you were expecting President Joe Biden to take a victory lap, to boast about his remarkable achievements in just 50 days in office, it's understandable. After four years of the former president, many of us became accustomed to self-serving rhetoric. But Biden's first prime-time address Thursday night was something altogether different from that.
""I need you,"" Biden said, leaning into his lectern, ""I need every American to do their part."" He said that if everyone agrees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, if everyone wears a mask like the..."
"All eyes were on President Joe Biden Thursday evening as he gave his first prime time address to the nation since taking office. Hours after signing a massive coronavirus relief bill into law, he commemorated the anniversary of the nation's shutdown over the pandemic.
The president urged Americans to be unified in battling the coronavirus and to continue to take precautions against its spread while the administration works to make vaccines more widely available. He struck a hopeful tone for the country's return to a semblance of normality while also..."
"President Donald Trump's attempt to punish companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook for alleged anti-conservative bias takes aim at the online industry's most-cherished legal protections — but the shot could ultimately be a glancing blow.
Trump announced the action Thursday, signing an executive order that he said would “defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers"" — tech platforms that have amassed ""unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.""
“We can't allow that to happen,”..."
"U.S. Catholic bishops overwhelmingly approved the drafting of a “teaching document” that many of them hope will rebuke Catholic politicians, including President Joe Biden, for receiving Communion despite their support for abortion rights.
The decision, vehemently opposed by a minority of bishops, came despite appeals from the Vatican for a more cautious and collegial approach to the divisive issue. And it raises questions of how closely the bishops will be able to cooperate with the Biden administration on issues such as immigration and racial injustice."
"The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on Friday proceeded with a plan that could deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights, setting up a potential public rebuke of President Joe Biden.
By a vote of 168 to 55, with six abstentions, the bishops went forward with plans for a report on the meaning of the Eucharist in the church. The vote is part of a longer process, and a rebuke of Biden and other Catholic politicians who support abortion rights is not assured. The report will be developed..."
"Given his history, registered Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democrat Michael Bloomberg was always going to have to work to convince Democrats he was one of them. On Monday night, recently surfaced 2015 audio from Bloomberg’s Aspen Institute remarks on controversial “stop-and-frisk” policing in 2015 show why."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Mike Bloomberg is under fire for resurfaced comments in which he says the way to bring down murder rates is to “put a lot of cops” in minority neighborhoods because that’s where “all the crime is.”
The billionaire and former New York mayor made the comments at a 2015 appearance at the Aspen Institute, as part of an overall defense of his support for the controversial “stop and frisk” policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately affect minorities.
Bloomberg launched his Democratic presidential bid late last..."
"U.S. retail sales rose in October for a third month, signaling households continue to spend even with the fastest inflation in decades. 
The value of overall retail purchases increased 1.7% last month, the most in seven months, following an upwardly revised 0.8% advance in September, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday. Excluding gas and motor vehicles, sales gained 1.4% in October. The figures aren’t adjusted for price changes.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.4% advance in overall retail sales. The S&P 500 advanced while..."

"Before Russia invaded Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky was often derided as a comic turned unlikely politician. But with the help of social media, he has become the leader Ukraine did not know it needed.
Dressed in an army-green T-shirt or fleece, unshaven and wan, Mr. Zelensky has inspired Ukrainians to fight for their country — and Europeans to see Ukraine in a different light, as a victim of aggression fighting bravely for independence, freedom and democracy."
"A devastating tornado outbreak tore through Kentucky and five other states on Friday night, killing dozens of people and leaving people trapped in factories and warehouses. More than 30 tornadoes were reported in Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois, Kentucky, and Mississippi. The main tornado that struck Kentucky traveled more than 227 miles, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said. “We believe our death toll from this event will exceed 50 Kentuckians and probably end up 70 to 100,” he said at a news conference. “It’s very hard, really tough, and we’re praying for each..."
"At least 70 people were feared dead in Kentucky after tornadoes and severe weather tore through multiple states and caused catastrophic damage.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference Saturday that the death toll may exceed 100.
“This has been the most devastating tornado event in our state’s history,” Beshear said.
The storms hit a candle factory in Kentucky, an Amazon facility in Illinois and a nursing home in Arkansas. Beshear said about 110 people were in the Mayfield factory when the tornado hit.

"The Senate voted Wednesday night to overturn President Joe Biden's Covid-19 vaccine or testing mandate for private businesses with 100 or more employees.
While it likely won't become law since its chances of getting a vote in the House are uncertain and Biden is certain to veto it, the effort demonstrates the bipartisan opposition in Congress to the federal government's vaccine mandate for large employers.
The effort was led by Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, and it needed just a simple majority of 51 votes to be approved by the chamber.

"Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has temporarily blocked Tuesday's appeals court decision that struck down bans on same-sex marriage in Idaho and Nevada.
Officials in Idaho had filed a last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court following Tuesday's appeals court decision. In his order, Kennedy gave lawyers representing same-sex couples until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond to the appeal.
""The order means that gay and lesbian couples will not be able to obtain marriage licenses in that state in the meantime,"" Lyle Denniston of SCOTUSblog notes."
"The Supreme Court spokeswoman says Justice Anthony Kennedy mistakenly blocked the start of same-sex marriage in Nevada in an order that spawned confusion among state officials and disappointment in couples hoping to be wed.
Spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Thursday that Kennedy's order issued a day earlier was an error that the justice corrected with a second order several hours later.
By that time, however, Nevada officials had decided to hold off on issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples until they could be certain the legal situation was settled."
"New York's attorney general has announced no officers will be charged following an investigation into the death of Daniel Prude, a 41-year-old Black man who died after being restrained by Rochester police last year.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday that her office presented the ""strongest case possible"" to a grand jury, but the grand jury decided not to indict any officers in the case. James' office is required to investigate police-involved deaths of unarmed civilians under state law.

"Race was a key topic of conversation at Thursday's Democratic presidential debate, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) each sought to establish themselves as the greatest adversary of racism and champion of communities of color.
Both candidates appeared to hit their stride on criminal justice reform and systemic racism. But when they were asked specifically if they'd be able to improve race relations, things got awkward."

"Donald Trump loves the spotlight and the camera. But when he takes center stage Thursday night, it won't be as the star of a reality TV show -- it will be as the Republican Party's front-runner presidential candidate. Trump and nine of his GOP rivals will battle it out in the 2016 cycle's inaugural GOP primary debate, hosted by Fox News in Cleveland. The stakes are high, as each participant clamors to stand out from a nearly unprecedented pack of 17 declared GOP candidates."
"It may be unfashionable to say, but national party conventions are important -- even when the parties can't convene.
They are among the few nights on the election calendar when a candidate and campaign have the chance to deliver an unfiltered message directly to an audience of tens of millions of Americans.
Joe Biden enters his convention with an average polling lead of 9 points, the strongest position of any challenger to an incumbent president in recent history."
"The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation expanding lifesaving health care benefits for Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.
The 86-11 vote came after Republicans agreed to lift their blockade of the popular bill, caving to pressure from more than 60 veterans groups — and comedian Jon Stewart — who had railed against Republicans for days outside the Capitol.
Many of the veterans who had camped on the Senate steps, braving heat, humidity and thunderstorms, watched the vote from the gallery in the Senate chamber. The bill has already..."
"President Joe Biden took questions from Wisconsin residents and from Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall event in Milwaukee on Tuesday night.
We're still looking into some of the claims Biden made, so this article is not comprehensive. But we can tell you now that he made at least four false claims -- all of them involving statistics -- about the minimum wage, undocumented immigrants, China's economy and Covid-19 vaccinations.
Biden also made claims that could have benefited from some additional context, that he acknowledged he might not have..."
"California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered a decisive answer to the question of whether voters would penalize those who enacted strict policies aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic, triumphing over an effort to recall him Tuesday.
Newsom faced the first recall election in California in 18 years. At one point, weeks before the election, he appeared to be in serious enough jeopardy that Democrats decided to dispatch President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to campaign for him.
Republicans sought a replay of 2003, when actor Arnold Schwarzenegger attracted support across ideological lines and voters decided to boot then-Gov...."
"In normal times, April 20 would be 4/20, the unofficial holiday for celebrating marijuana. People would be preparing to rally near state capitols, in concerts, and at huge fairs to fill the air with thick, pungent smoke.
But April 20 this year, on Monday, doesn’t come during normal times. With a coronavirus pandemic still going, much of the United States and the rest of the world are staying at home as much as possible to avoid the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That means the..."
"DENVER – The marijuana industry embraces change.
Edible products and pre-rolled joints are out. Vape concentrates and loose ""flower,"" which can be packed into bongs or pipes or rolled into joints and provide more bang for the buck, are in.
Stores are effectively closed. Instead, customers order online and pick up curbside, a major shift from when each buyer had to be personally verified by a licensed store worker. In California, stores have largely switched to an all-delivery model.
The country's burgeoning marijuana industry is working swiftly to..."
"On August 9, Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was killed by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, MO. Eyewitnesses to the shooting report that Brown was killed while attempting to surrender, but police say that Brown assaulted the officer before the shooting.
The incident provoked immediate anger and frustration in the community and around the country. The killing of Eric Garner, also an unarmed black man, by New York City police last month revived a public conversation about the history of police violence against black..."
"The Iowa caucuses aren't over yet. A delay in the results meant the state Democratic Party did not call the race Monday night as expected, leaving the candidates and their supporters in limbo.
In a brief statement he read to reporters over the phone shortly after 2 a.m. ET, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price said, ""At this point the [Iowa Democratic Party] is manually verifying all precinct results. We expect to have numbers to report later today.""
""We are validating every piece of data we have against our paper..."
"The many, many things that seem to have gone wrong with the Iowa Democratic Party’s vote-counting process.
The Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the 2020 Democratic primary, have been going for hours, and at this point it’s clear that results are badly delayed. As of 11:40 pm, not a single precinct’s votes have been publicly reported by the state party; at this point in 2016, 90 percent of precincts had reported their totals.
In a statement at 11:30 pm Monday, the Iowa Democratic Party said the delay was due..."
"(CNN) - President Donald Trump on Sunday morning told America who he believes are ""great people."" They're the supporters who scream ""white power"" in response to those who call the President a racist.
That, at least, seemed to be the message from Trump's sharing of a two-minute video showing residents from a Florida community known as The Villages driving in golf carts adorned with signs such as ""Trump 2020"" and ""America First."" As these Trump supporters approached anti-Trump protesters, some of whom were holding up Black Lives Matters signs, one..."
"As he rode down that escalator in June 2015, it felt like a lark, a curiosity, just another staged television spectacle. At most, many assumed that Donald J. Trump’s candidacy would be a sideshow, sure to be entertaining but hardly decisive.
Four years later, as President Trump kicks off his campaign for a second term on Tuesday with an eardrum-pounding, packed-to-the-rafters rally in Florida, no one doubts that he is the dominant force in the arena today, the one defining the national conversation as no president has done in generations...."
"To share the high costs of covering the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, more than a dozen news organizations banded together to form a press pool — essentially a collaborative in which reporters from contributing organizations take turns shadowing the Democratic front-runner and sending back e-mailed reports of her every move. The whole idea rests upon the expectation that the Clinton campaign will provide access to the pool reporter."
"Congressional Democrats will introduce legislation Thursday to expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 justices, joining progressive activists pushing to transform the court.
The move intensifies a high-stakes ideological fight over the future of the court after President Donald Trump and Republicans appointed three conservative justices in four years, including one who was confirmed days before the 2020 election.
The Democratic bill is led by Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee. It is co-sponsored by Reps...."
"The Uvalde school board voted unanimously Wednesday evening to immediately terminate the contract of district police chief Pete Arredondo, three months after a teenaged gunman took the lives of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary.
The board made its decision in a closed session meeting lasting nearly an hour-and-a-half. Several members of the audience applauded after the decision was announced. One person was heard repeatedly shouting: ""We're not done.""
Arredondo didn't attend the meeting. His attorney instead issued a 17-page press statement that said the district wasn't following legal procedure as..."
"China cut off contacts with the United States on vital issues Friday — including military matters and crucial climate cooperation — as concerns rose that the Communist government’s hostile reaction to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit could signal a lasting, more aggressive approach toward its U.S. rival and the self-ruled island.
China’s move to freeze key lines of communication compounded the worsening of relations from Pelosi’s visit and from the Chinese response with military exercises off Taiwan, including firing missiles that splashed down in surrounding waters.
After the White House summoned..."
"Paul Ryan pledged Wednesday that if he and his running mate Mitt Romney were elected president, they would usher in an ethic of responsibility. The Wisconsin congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate repeatedly chided President Barack Obama for blaming the jobs and housing crises on his predecessor, saying that his habit of ""forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago -Ã¢â‚¬â€œ isnt it about time he assumed responsibility?"""
"Islamic State militants have accepted a pledge of allegiance by Nigerian-grown Boko Haram extremist group, a spokesman for the Islamic State movement said Thursday.
Boko Haram has been weakened by a multinational force that has dislodged it from a score of northeastern Nigerian towns. But its new Twitter account, increasingly slick and more frequent video messages and a new media arm all were considered signs that the group is now being helped by IS propagandists.
Then on Saturday, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Sheka posted an audio recording online that pledged..."
"The Islamic State is facing growing dissension among its rank-and-file fighters and struggling to govern towns and villages it has seized, but the militant Sunni group is still managing to launch attacks and expand its ideological reach outside of Iraq and Syria, senior American officials said.
In the seven months since allied warplanes in the American-led air campaign began bombing select Islamic State targets, the Sunni militancy, while marginally weaker, is holding its own, senior defense and intelligence officials said.
Pentagon officials expressed only cautious optimism on Thursday after the..."

"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday embraced calls for an international war crimes investigation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, citing the “atrocities” of bombing civilians, including a maternity hospital.
Speaking alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda at a press conference in Warsaw, where she is demonstrating U.S. support for NATO’s eastern flank allies, Harris expressed outrage over the bombing Wednesday of the maternity hospital and scenes of bloodied pregnant women being evacuated, as well as other attacks on civilians. She stopped short of directly accusing Russia of having committed..."
"RICHMOND — The Virginia Senate on Wednesday passed a ""red flag"" law that would allow authorities to temporarily seize the firearm of someone deemed a threat, a measure that was strongly opposed by gun rights advocates who swarmed the streets around the state Capitol on Monday.
The bill passed on a party-line vote of 21-19, with every Democrat in favor and every Republican against. Debate grew unusually sharp as some GOP senators suggested that the bill would violate the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.
“Each legislator that votes in..."
"The Senate parliamentarian has ruled against including the increase in the minimum wage in the Covid relief bill.
While Democrats had pushed for the increase to be included -- and leadership expressed its disappointment in the ruling Thursday evening -- its removal may actually make it easier to pass the bill, senior Democratic sources believe, because it'll avoid a messy fight over whether to strip it out of the bill and whether to compromise."
"The crypto crackdown has come for Kim Kardashian.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Monday that the queen of influencers did a little too much influencing when it came to the EthereumMax (EMAX) token, which Kardashian promoted on her Instagram in June 2021. She’s agreed to pay $1.26 million and not promote crypto securities for the next three years.
The settlement shows that the SEC is ready, willing, and able to go after celebrity crypto endorsers. Many of them made plenty of money promoting what ended up being shady crypto schemes that quickly collapsed,..."
President Barack Obama will tell House Democrats on Thursday that his budget will call for an end to sequestration cuts and build on the “middle class economics” package he outlined in the State of the Union — setting up a clear contrast with Republicans in Congress who want to stick to the spending limits.
"The Taliban just gave its first press conference since the insurgent group took over Afghanistan. 
Zabihullah Mujahid, the long-elusive Taliban spokesman, appeared in front of cameras for the first time to promise security and peace during the Taliban takeover. “After 20 years of struggle we have emancipated [Afghanistan] and expelled foreigners. This is a proud moment for the whole nation,” he said. “This was our right, and we achieved this right, and we would like to express our gratitude to almighty God for having brought us to this stage.”

"The episode that encapsulated the Republican establishment’s capitulation to Donald Trump had been planned as a repudiation of him. It was when Senator Marco Rubio, in a bid to salvage his sinking candidacy in the 2016 Republican primaries, suggested that Mr Trump had a small penis. Formerly known as a high-minded conservative, Mr Rubio also mocked the Republican front-runner’s hair and “orange” skin. “Donald Trump likes to sue people,” he told a crowd in Virginia, ahead of the round of primaries that more or less sealed Mr Trump’s capture of..."
"Rep. Paul Ryan is walking into a hornet's nest.
After he managed to win support from his warring caucus, the full House is expected to elect Ryan as speaker on Thursday. But he won't have much time to celebrate, because he will immediately confront a series of divisive issues that could undermine his hold on the speakership just as he reaches the pinnacle of his career."
"Disgraced socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the sex-trafficking ring of young teens she helped financier Jeffrey Epstein run for a decade.
The punishment doled out by U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan on Tuesday marks the most concrete punishment yet for the years of abuse Maxwell and Epstein imposed on young girls.
Several of those girls, now adults, testified during the trial, bravely pulling the curtain back on years of abuse they suffered after Maxwell and Epstein tugged them into their orbit. The two often used the allure..."
"Former president George W. Bush, who has written a book he calls ""a love letter"" to his father (that would be former president George H.W. Bush), also has a message in mind for brother Jeb.

"Will Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, try to become the third member of his immediate family to run for president? His brother calls it “a toss up.”
In an interview with CBS broadcast Sunday on “Face the Nation,” former President George W. Bush said his brother was “wrestling with the decision” about whether to undertake a presidential campaign in 2016. The former president said he put the chances of his brother doing so at “50-50.”
“I know this about Jeb,” Mr. Bush said. “He is not afraid to succeed...."
"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that President Biden would hold a news conference “before the end of the month.” Last month would have been better, and this week would be better than next. Avoiding news conferences must not become a regular habit for Mr. Biden. He is the president, and Americans have every right to expect that he will regularly submit himself to substantial questioning.
We say this while recognizing that Mr. Biden has shown galaxies more respect for the free press and the people’s right to..."
"A nationwide study begins Monday to find out if a potential coronavirus vaccine, developed by Cambridge-based Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is safe and effective in preventing people from getting COVID-19.
The clinical trial will enroll 30,000 people, with Brigham and Women’s Hospital leading the New England section of the trial.
The Moderna vaccine is one of five candidates that have advanced to Phase 3, the stage of research in which large numbers of people get either the vaccine or a placebo and are then..."
"What did Justice Clarence Thomas know, and when did he know it?
The question usually gets directed at politicians, not judges, but it’s a fair one in light of the revelation on Thursday that Justice Thomas’s wife, Ginni, was working feverishly behind the scenes — and to a far greater degree than she previously admitted — in a high-level effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
As The Washington Post and CBS News first reported, Ms. Thomas, a supremely well-connected right-wing agitator, was in constant communication with the White House in the weeks following..."
"Three dangerous prisoners have escaped from the Orange County Men's Central Jail by cutting through half-inch steel bars, making their way through plumbing tunnels and rappelling from the roof using a makeshift rope. The three, who were facing charges ranging from murder to kidnap and torture, are believed to be armed and dangerous. Meanwhile, sheriff's officials shared photos of how it happened."
"The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider legal arguments over the Texas abortion law that is the nation’s most restrictive on Nov. 1, and that the law will remain in effect.
The court granted an expedited review of what is called S. B. 8, which the Biden administration in a filing Friday said “has virtually eliminated abortion in Texas after six weeks of pregnancy.”"
"This is not a normal tax year for the Internal Revenue Service. As millions of American households scramble to meet the April 18 filing deadline, it’s easy to view this as just another tax season that causes temporary annoyance and then fades in the headlines and minds of most people. But there’s a lot more at stake.
The IRS is currently limping along without enough staff or funding. Congress, especially Republicans, needs to face up to reality. The IRS still manually enters the information on paper tax returns into its computing system because..."
"Large protests erupted throughout Charlotte, North Carolina, late Tuesday night after police shot and killed a black father.
The family of the victim, who was identified as 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, says he was disabled, and was unarmed and reading a book in his car when he was killed. Police claim Scott was armed."
"Leaders of several Western countries have said leaks in two Russian gas pipelines are likely the result of sabotage, vowing a strong response as investigations continue.
Swedish authorities sounded the alarm on Tuesday about leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines – both of which run under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark, and have been major flashpoints in the energy war between Europe and Russia.
Neither pipeline was in operation at the time the leaks were found, but both still contained gas under pressure...."
"The Biden administration wants a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to show that his country is taken seriously as a world power. That is the backdrop for the first summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, which will take place in Geneva on June 16.
""Russia is quite invested in having a very friction-filled rather than friction-free relationship with the United States,"" warns Fiona Hill of the Brookings Institution.
U.S.-Russian relations have been in a downward spiral since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea..."
"President Joe Biden frequently talks about what he sees as central in executing effective foreign policy: building personal relationships.
But unlike his four most recent White House predecessors, who made an effort to build a measure of rapport with Vladimir Putin, Biden has made clear that the virtue of fusing a personal connection might have its limits when it comes to the Russian leader.
Biden, who is set to meet with Putin face to face on Wednesday in Geneva, has repeated an anecdote about his last meeting with Putin, 10 years ago when..."
"HOUSTON — The foreign strategy of soothing tensions with the United States by stroking President Trump’s ego was put into vivid effect here Sunday when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi lathered praise on his American counterpart at a massive rally celebrating the Indian diaspora.
The leaders of the world’s two largest democracies took the stage together in Houston before a roaring crowd of tens of thousands of Indian Americans, where Modi delivered an unmistakable endorsement of Trump’s presidency and cast their joint appearance in historic terms."
"President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced plans to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba and ease economic restrictions on the nation, an historic shift he called the end of an ""outdated approach"" to U.S.-Cuban relations.
Obama said he's instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba to re-establish diplomatic relations, and that the U.S. will re-open an embassy in Havana. The administration will also allow some travel and trade that had been banned under a decades-long embargo instated during the Kennedy administration.
""Neither the American..."
"President Obama is putting his most ardent Republican critics on notice: Remember what I vowed to do as a candidate in 2008? I have two years left in office, and I intend to do it all.
Mr. Obama’s decision on Wednesday to radically shift United States policy toward Cuba is the latest and most striking example of a president unleashed from the hesitancy that characterized much of his first six years in office. It follows decisions by Mr. Obama to defy Republicans on immigration, climate change policy, the regulation of..."
"MGM Resorts International has agreed to pay up to $800 million to settle thousands of liability claims stemming from the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, lawyers announced Thursday, almost exactly two years after the bloodshed.
On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman on the 32rd floor of the MGM-owned Mandalay Bay resort rained bullets on crowd of people at a country music festival, killing 58 and injuring hundreds.
Lawyers representing survivors and victims wanted MGM held liable for negligence because the shooter was able to enter the hotel with luggage..."
"(CNN)MGM Resorts International and the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting reached a landmark settlement worth between $735 million and $800 million, depending on the number of claimants, MGM said in a statement Thursday.
MGM said the settlement is not an admission of liability in the October 1, 2017 mass shooting that left 58 dead and hundreds wounded or injured. It is the worst mass shooting in modern American history.
""Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families..."
"Just this week, three House Democrats announced they won't seek reelection in 2022: New Jersey's Albio Sires, Florida's Stephanie Murphy and California's Lucille Roybal-Allard. That makes 23 House Democrats who have announced they're retiring or running for another office next year, as the party braces for the possible loss of its already slim majority in the House in next year's midterm elections. 
By comparison, just 11 House Republicans have said they're not coming back after their 2020 term ends. Two members, Steve Stivers of Ohio and Devin Nunes of California, resigned..."

It might even, as he would later describe it, become a “kill shot."
"Rose McGowan says the Democratic Party is just as much of a cult as the one she was raised in.
Growing up with the Children of God “gave me the ability to see the control and the propaganda machine, especially in the U.S., for what it is and how it harms people,” the actor and activist said Monday on Fox News.
The “Brave” author called that ability a “superpower” that allowed her to see that the political left could harm people just as much as the right, if they ignore..."
"People signing up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s federal and state marketplaces tend to be older and potentially less healthy, officials said Monday, a demographic mix that could threaten the law’s economic underpinnings and cause premiums to rise in the future if the pattern persists."

In the abortion controversy, Kavanaugh wanted the justices to sidestep any ruling on the merits of a Louisiana law that could have closed abortion clinics in the state, CNN has learned. The case marked the first time in four years the justices were taking..."
"Pentagon airstrikes against Iran-backed militias in Syria are not only the first military action taken by President Joe Biden. They are a test of his broad pledge to pursue a foreign policy that is more cooperative and mindful of international partners than his predecessor's but still eschews the U.S. role as the world's police to focus on making life better for Americans, some experts and lawmakers say.
Biden on Thursday night ordered the airstrikes on multiple facilities at a Syrian-Iraqi border control point in southeastern Syria in retaliation for rocket..."
"In a single stroke on Thursday, President Joe Biden did far more than destroy a few support facilities for Iranian-backed Syrian militias. Unlike his two predecessors, Biden has drawn a new red line in the Middle East and shown he is prepared to defend it.
Pentagon officials said two F15s dropped Joint Direct Attack Munitions (precision weapons with GPS navigation capabilities) on buildings at an unofficial border crossing believed to be used by militias to transfer munitions into Syria from Iraq.
The strike sought to cripple the ability..."
"Two men have been charged with assaulting Officer Brian D. Sicknick of the Capitol Police and other officers during the Jan. 6 riot, the Justice Department said on Monday, but prosecutors stopped short of linking the attack to Officer Sicknick’s death the next day.
The F.B.I. arrested George Pierre Tanios, 39, of Morgantown, W.Va., and Julian Elie Khater, 32, of State College, Pa., on Sunday. They were charged with conspiracy to injure an officer, assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon, civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, and other..."
"House Republicans on Monday released long-anticipated legislation to supplant the Affordable Care Act with a more conservative vision for the nation’s health-care system, replacing federal insurance subsidies with a new form of individual tax credits and grants to help states shape their own policies."
"A new Texas law that effectively bans most abortions prompted President Joe Biden on Wednesday to use a word he'd entirely avoided as president: ""Abortion.""
The absence of the word in Biden's public remarks and statements has frustrated activists, who say it reflects an issue that fell off the priority list even as women's right to an abortion comes under threat in states across the Midwest and South.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday night formally denied a request from Texas abortion providers to freeze the state law, meaning it will remain on the books for now. Abortion providers..."
"The name of the bill — the “United States Innovation and Competition Act” (USICA), though it’s gone by a few different titles — probably makes it sound boring, but it’s proving to be one of the most contentious legislative disputes of the current Congress.
At issue is a bill that lawmakers in both parties and both chambers have been working on for nearly a year. The point of USICA is relatively straightforward: It intends to bolster American competitiveness and counter China, in large part by addressing domestic semiconductor shortages. It’s..."
"FRIDAY HAS always been Charles’s day. Since long ago, before digital news, when space meant just a strip across the top of a printed page, we knew to save space on Friday’s page for Charles Krauthammer. Charles always filled the space, with just the right number of words, and the most acute words, too. Our copy editors knew to check any change with Charles, because he cared about every word. There was never much to change."
"There's one government agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is essentially tasked with protecting the unsuspecting public from predatory actions on the part of financial companies. One department of the CFPB deals with student loans — and according to someone leaving that office, it's not in great shape. A student loan official quit his position, and he made sure to let the agency know why on his way out."
"Taiwan will not bow to pressure and nobody can force it to accept the path China has laid out for the self-governing democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said Sunday as the island celebrated its National Day amid heightened tensions with Beijing.

Her speech came days after China flew record numbers of warplanes into its defense..."
"Taiwan’s president on Sunday vowed to defend the island from China’s rising pressure for reunification, after a week of unprecedented tensions with Beijing.

Mr. Musk has shown himself to be a highly capable peddler of dubious claims, whether putting out misleading financial information or calling the British diver who helped rescue trapped schoolboys..."
"President Trump on Sunday weighed in on the friction between a group of four freshman Democratic congresswomen and Speaker Nancy Pelosi: He suggested that the congresswomen — none of whom are white — should “go back and help fix” the countries they came from. His message was immediately seized upon by Democrats, who called it a racist trope."

"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran on Saturday said it now uses arrays of advanced centrifuges prohibited by its 2015 nuclear deal and can enrich uranium “much more beyond” current levels to weapons-grade material, taking a third step away from the accord while warning Europe has little time to offer it new terms.
While insisting Iran doesn’t seek a nuclear weapon, the comments by Behrouz Kamalvandi of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran threatened pushing uranium enrichment far beyond levels ever reached in the country. Prior to the atomic deal, Iran..."
"Iran has stated itis now capable of raising uranium enrichment past the 20% level and, while it has no immediate plans to do so, the clock is ticking towards the point where the 2015 nuclear deal could not be salvaged.

The Biden administration is close to advising fully vaccinated Americans get COVID-19 booster shots eight months after their last vaccine. A source familiar with the discussions among administration health experts said this recommendation could come as soon as this week.
The plan was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post.
The boosters would be intended to protect against the highly contagious delta variant, which has caused caseloads in..."

"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump isn’t giving up on the dubious idea that Alabama faced a serious threat from Hurricane Dorian.
During an Oval Office briefing Wednesday, Trump displayed a map of the National Hurricane Center forecast for last Thursday that showed Dorian could track over Florida. The map he displayed included what appeared to be a hand-drawn half-circle that extended the cone of uncertainty over a swath of Alabama.
Trump had raised eyebrows and drawn an emphatic fact check from the National Weather Service on Sunday when he..."
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump displayed a large map of Hurricane Dorian’s path in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it was hard to miss a black line that appeared to have been drawn to extend the storm’s possible path into the state of Alabama.
That might have been intended to bolster Mr. Trump’s claim on Sunday when he tweeted that “in addition to Florida — South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.”
Never mind that the Alabama office of the National..."
"House Speaker John A. Boehner said Sunday that if Congress is unable to reach a compromise to continue funding for the Department of Homeland Security, it is the Senate Democratic minority that deserves the blame.

The two ex-Soviet countries have been locked in a decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part..."
"(CNN)--The Trump administration yanked the rug out from under more than a million Americans on Friday by removing protections that prohibit discrimination in health care against transgender patients. This move -- announced on the four-year anniversary of a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orland, Florida, in which 49 people died -- is cruel and unusual punishment from an administration that chooses to represent a small and extreme fringe pushing to further marginalize the already disadvantaged."

"Tuesday night was a disaster for Democrats nationally. Period.
Losing the Virginia governor's race in a state that President Joe Biden had won by 10 percentage points just a year earlier was bad enough.

The referendums, which are illegal under international law and dismissed as “a sham” by Western governments and Kyiv, could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive as an attack on Russia itself.
Such a move could provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate its faltering war, which has..."

And so they are acting, because Congress won't -- as the Associated Press reported, most of the Postal Service's ""red ink comes from a 2006 law forcing it to pay about $5.5 billion..."
"Move over Northface, The U.S. Postal Service is dropping Saturday mail delivery and picking up a new line of clothing. On Tuesday, USPS announced plans to launch a new line of all-weather apparel and accessories.
The line, which is expected to launch in 2014, will include all-weather jackets, headgear, footwear and clothing which accommodates devices such as iPods.
Isaac Crawford, CEO of Wahconah Group, Inc. tells ABC News that this is going to be an “image-conscious, first class, high end line.
Crawford says that there is a..."
"New York City saw 112 people die from coronavirus in just 25 hours as the number of cases grew to more than 36,000 on Monday morning.
There were 36,221 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the five boroughs by 10:30 a.m. Monday, a 12% increase from 32,308 at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, according to Health Department data.
So far the virus has killed 790 people in the city, with the death toll climbing 16.5% from 678 fatalities on Sunday morning."
"The USNS Comfort, one of the Navy's hospital ships that has often been called on to deliver humanitarian aid, has arrived in New York City to help ease the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ship entered New York Harbor on Monday morning, passing the Statue of Liberty on its way to Pier 88 in Manhattan.
The ship will be used to treat patients who do not have the disease caused by the coronavirus but who urgently need other care. Those patients could otherwise face long delays as the city's..."
"President Biden will host a White House summit next month aimed at combating a spate of hate-fueled violence in the U.S., as he works to deliver on his campaign pledge to ""heal the soul of the nation.""
The White House announced Friday that Mr. Biden will host the United We Stand Summit on Sept. 15, highlighting the ""corrosive effects"" of violence on public safety and democracy. Advocates pushed the president to hold the event after 10 Black people were killed at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket in May, aiming as well to..."
"President Donald Trump's demagogic convention speech played out before a spectacular but norm-crushing White House backdrop in a potential super spreader viral event.
It explained why Democrats warn he must be driven from power at all costs -- and why he may win a second term anyway.
After a GOP gathering that amounted to one of the most sustained displays of propagandizing in the modern history of Western democracy, Trump painted an apocalyptic vision of a nation on the cusp of a takeover by ""violent anarchists"" who would exploit..."
"President Trump on Friday leveled an extraordinary broadside at the Chinese government, accusing it of a comprehensive “pattern of misconduct” and ordered U.S. officials to begin the process of revoking Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law.
The U.S. as a result will no longer treat Hong Kong and China as separate entities for the purposes of extradition, customs, trade and visa issues, he said.
In Rose Garden remarks, Trump also attacked the World Health Organization, which he said was effectively controlled by Beijing.
“We will today be terminating our..."
"A baseless conspiracy theory about the coronavirus has found new life as cases surge once again.
On Monday morning, the phrase “The Great Reset” trended with nearly 80,000 tweets, with most of the posts coming from familiar far-right internet personalities. The conspiracy alleges that a cabal of elites has long planned for the pandemic so that they could use it to impose their global economic control on the masses. In some versions of the unfounded rumor, it is only President Trump who is thwarting this plan and keeping the scheme..."
"The White House has issued a “fact sheet” listing the industries and policies it’s addressing via an executive order that President Biden will sign later today — and technology is directly in the crosshairs.
That includes internet service providers, as Biden will encourage the Federal Communications Commission to restore net neutrality rules undone during the prior administration, require providers to report prices and subscription rates, and prevent ISPs from making deals with landlords that limit tenants’ choices."
"Before Donald Trump became president, most newspaper op-ed pages sought to present a spectrum of politically significant opinion and argument, which they could largely do while walling off extremist propaganda and incitement. The Trump presidency has undermined that model, because there’s generally no way to defend the administration without being either bigoted or dishonest.
Opinion sections, eager to maintain ideological diversity without publishing lies or stuff that belongs in Breitbart, have therefore filled up with anti-Trump conservatives. As a result, newspapers like this one have often been criticized for elevating..."
"NEW YORK (AP) — In an embarrassing about-face, The New York Times said Thursday that an opinion piece it ran by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton advocating the use of federal troops to quell nationwide protests about police mistreatment of black Americans did not meet its standards.
Cotton’s op-ed, titled “Send in the Troops” and first posted online late Wednesday, caused a revolt among Times journalists, with some saying it endangered black employees. Some staff members called in sick Thursday in protest.
The Times said in a statement that a “rushed..."
"One day after the fourth case of Ebola was diagnosed in the United States, lawmakers met with administration and public health officials in an already-scheduled congressional hearing to hash out some concerns about the handling of the deadly virus.
Here are four concerns raised in the hearing:
1. Why hire a lawyer? Ebola czar Ron Klain was invited to attend the hearing, but having started the job just this past week, he did not accept the invitation. In his absence, a few Republicans tweaked President Obama for choosing..."
"At a Congressional hearing to evaluate America's response to the Ebola outbreak, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) eschewed the calm approach, suggesting U.S. medical officials are flailing in the dark and that their ignorance could prove deadly.
Issa started by pointing out the flaws of the response so far, which has seen two nurses become infected in Texas while treating the first victim of the disease to become ill in the United States. Then he went on to compare Ebola, which can only be spread by contact with..."
"(CNN)—The chief of staff to Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is leaving her congressional office, according to her communications director. The move is effective immediately.
Saikat Chakrabarti is leaving to join New Consensus, a progressive group working on the Green New Deal.

"In the year since George Floyd died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, the explosive waves of national protest that followed have taken on almost a settled meaning: They were calls for police reform, and for America to take a hard look at the racial injustice threaded through its civic life.
But in its breadth and impact, the reaction to Floyd’s killing also blew through any conventional expectations for what a “protest” might touch. The reckoning it prompted about race in America extended to workplaces, classrooms, legislatures; it..."
"""We will celebrate my brother's life in a very, very special way,"" Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd's sister, said at a virtual press conference Thursday.
Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. His death started months of protests worldwide against police brutality and systemic racism. 
Last month, Chauvin was found guilty of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other former officers accused of aiding and abetting Chauvin will stand trial in March 2022. All..."
"President Obama has decided to appoint Joseph P. Clancy, who has guided the Secret Service on an interim basis for the last four months, to lead the agency permanently, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.
In appointing Mr. Clancy, a former head of Mr. Obama’s security detail, the president rejected calls from critics on Capitol Hill and members of a special Department of Homeland Security panel that said that a string of mishaps and scandals made it clear that the agency should be run by an outsider.
Had Mr. Obama chosen..."
"The Arkansas Senate has passed a bill that would prevent medical practitioners from providing healthcare to trans minors in a shocking blow to the LGBT+ community.
The senate passed HB 1570 on Monday (29 March), making Arkansas the first state to ban puberty blockers and hormone treatment for trans youth.
The bill will now go to governor Asa Hutchinson to be signed into law. LGBT+ rights activists are calling on the governor to veto the dehumanising law.
Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union..."
"The Arkansas Senate on Monday approved banning gender confirming treatments for minors, sending the governor a restriction on transgender youth that has been criticized by medical and child welfare groups.
The majority Republican Senate voted 28-7 in favor of the legislation. If the bill is enacted it would be the first prohibition of its kind in the country, opponents say. The bill would prohibit doctors from providing gender confirming hormone treatment or surgery to minors, or from referring them to other providers for the treatment.
“This bill sets out to..."
"The situation in Afghanistan is grim. An occupying army is withdrawing its last troops, bombs are besieging Kabul and the country appears on the verge of a civil war. U.S. diplomats believe they can't count on the shaky Afghan government to survive, much less protect them.
It's Jan. 30, 1989, two weeks until the last Soviet forces leave, and U.S. officials have just closed the American Embassy in Kabul, while promising “the United States will return.” But they wouldn’t reopen the diplomatic mission until January 2002, after the U.S. came back to Afghanistan..."
"Mexicans are deeply frustrated with immigrants after a year of heightened migration from Central America through the country, according to a survey conducted by The Washington Post and Mexico’s Reforma newspaper.
More than 6 in 10 Mexicans say migrants are a burden on their country because they take jobs and benefits that should belong to Mexicans. A 55 percent majority supports deporting migrants who travel through Mexico to reach the United States. Those findings defy the perception that Mexico — a country that has sent millions of its own..."
"More than 60 percent of Mexicans believe migrants are a burden and that they take away jobs and benefits, according to a recent poll. A majority supports deporting them. Last month, Mexico made a deal with the United States to crack down on Central American migrants who are trying to make their way to the U.S. border. In June, Mexico arrested and deported the highest number of migrants in more than 10 years, and there were questions about how this tough approach would play in Mexico. But new public polling..."
"California is the first state in the U.S. to establish a reparations task force for Black Americans. On June 1, the Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans issued a 500-page document that traces the history of white supremacy from slavery to Jim Crow through the present. It calls for “comprehensive reparations” for Black people harmed by a historical system of state-sanctioned oppression.
“Segregation, racial terror, harmful racist neglect, and other atrocities in nearly every sector of civil society have inflicted harms, which cascade over a lifetime and..."
"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell delivered a message to his fellow policymakers on Tuesday: Faced with a once-in-a-century pandemic that has inflicted economic pain on millions of households, go big.
“Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,” Mr. Powell said in remarks before the National Association for Business Economics.
“Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth,” he said. “By contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem,..."
"Strong financial support from the government and the Federal Reserve have spurred a solid recovery from the pandemic recession, but the rebound may falter without further aid, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned Tuesday.
Powell said that government support — including expanded unemployment insurance payments, direct payments to most U.S. households and financial support for small businesses — has so far prevented a recessionary “downward spiral” in which job losses would reduce spending, forcing businesses to cut even more jobs.
But the U.S. economy still faces threats, and without further support..."
"One week before they are set to unveil a sprawling overhaul of the federal tax code, Republicans struggled on Wednesday with key parts of their plan, reigniting a fight over retirement savings and racing to cut a deal with lawmakers from high-tax states ahead of a critical budget vote in the House on Thursday."
"The subminimum wage for service workers is a direct legacy of slavery and perpetuates some of the worst sexual harassment of any industry. And yet for years, Congress and the 43 states that still have a subminimum wage have been dragging their heels on ending it – despite widespread public support for raising wages.
Then something changed. During the pandemic, restaurant owners in New York and nationwide have seen their workers struggling more than ever to survive on poverty wages. When restaurants closed, many service workers couldn’t even get unemployment because under..."
"Congress can sometimes demonstrate an unfashionable truth: It’s still capable of bipartisan achievements — they just tend to take years.
The Senate on Thursday passed legislation by voice vote to reform the way private companies handle sexual assault and harassment cases by ending the use of forced arbitration to resolve workplace disputes. The bill, first introduced in 2017, is more narrow than some advocates had hoped but nonetheless amounts to Congress’ most significant response to the #MeToo movement to date.
And everyone has a different theory for why it’s finally headed for..."
"Congress on Thursday gave final approval to legislation guaranteeing that people who experience sexual harassment at work can seek recourse in the courts, a milestone for the #MeToo movement that prompted a national reckoning on the way sexual misconduct claims are handled.
The measure, which is expected to be signed by President Joe Biden, bars employment contracts from forcing people to settle sexual assault or harassment cases through arbitration rather than in court, a process that often benefits employers and keeps misconduct allegations from becoming public.
Significantly, the bill is..."
"In an alarming assessment, the head of the United Nations warned world leaders Tuesday that nations are “gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction” and aren’t ready or willing to tackle the challenges that threaten humanity’s future — and the planet’s. “Our world is in peril — and paralyzed,” he said.
Speaking at the opening of the General Assembly’s annual high-level meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made sure to emphasize that hope remained. But his remarks reflected a tense and worried world. He cited the war in Ukraine and multiplying conflicts around the..."
"President Barack Obama said Friday he is releasing an additional $70 million in military aid for Israel, a previously announced move that appeared timed to upstage Republican rival Mitt Romney's trip to Israel this weekend.
The stepped-up U.S. aid, first announced in May, will go to help Israel expand production of a short-range rocket defense system. The system, known as Iron Dome, has proved successful at stopping rocket attacks fired at Israeli civilians from close range, including from Gaza."
"The wave of protest and looting that swept across much of South Africa over the past week was planned by enemies of democracy in a deliberate effort to sow chaos, the president has said.
Speaking to reporters in some of the areas worst hit by the unrest, Cyril Ramaphosa said authorities had identified “a good number” of those who planned and coordinated the violence, the worst in South Africa since the end of the apartheid regime in 1994.
“We will not allow anyone to destroy our democracy. This is a hard-fought-for democracy and we..."
"The White House said on Wednesday that it is ready to quickly roll out COVID-19 vaccines for kids ages 5 to 11, if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for that age group is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The administration has bought enough doses for all 28 million children in that age group, and will provide it in smaller packages with essential supplies like smaller needles to make it easier to get to physicians, pediatricians and community health centers, Biden..."
"The White House on Wednesday unveiled its plans to roll out Covid-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, pending US Food and Drug Administration authorization.
The Biden administration has secured enough vaccine supply to vaccinate the 28 million children ages 5 to 11 who would become eligible for vaccination if the vaccine is authorized for that age group and will help equip more than 25,000 pediatric and primary care offices, hundreds of community health centers and rural health clinics as well as tens of thousands of pharmacies to administer the shots,..."
"President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled his opening bid on Covid-19 relief and economic recovery: a $1.9 trillion stimulus deal meant to help the United States address the health and economic crises induced by the pandemic.
The proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, is divvied up into three buckets: $400 billion for dealing with the coronavirus, including vaccines and testing; $1 trillion in direct relief to families; and $400 billion in aid to communities and businesses. It includes money for testing, vaccines, and public health workers; $400 a week in extended..."
"There's not much suspense going into Thursday's meeting of the US Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisers, who will discuss emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. The EUA is widely expected and has been telegraphed with unusual frankness from the top of the FDA on down. ""Our team has done their initial analysis, and we do feel that preliminarily that the success criteria have been met,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn told CNN Tuesday. But the FDA has promised to listen to the advice of its Vaccines..."
"No matter how long Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin remains in politics, he’ll probably never release an ad that generated more attention than the one he released in 2010. The then-governor, as part of his first Senate campaign in West Virginia, was filmed literally shooting a copy of a cap-and-trade bill with a rifle.
It was memorable — and based on Manchin’s victory, effective — in large part because Americans generally aren’t accustomed to seeing politicians brandishing firearms as part of their campaign pitches.
That is, Americans weren’t accustomed to seeing this.

"(CNN)Stabbings inside a rabbi's home on the seventh day of Hanukkah marked the latest in a string of incidents that have targeted the Jewish community in New York.
On Saturday night, more than 100 people were gathered in the home when a man walked in and pulled out a knife that one witness said looked ""almost like a broomstick."""
"MONSEY, N.Y. (AP) — A knife-wielding man stormed into a rabbi’s home and stabbed five people as they celebrated Hanukkah in an Orthodox Jewish community north of New York City, an ambush the governor said Sunday was an act of domestic terrorism fueled by intolerance and a “cancer” of growing hatred in America.
Police tracked a fleeing suspect to Manhattan and made an arrest within hours of the attack Saturday night in Monsey. Grafton E. Thomas had blood all over his clothing and smelled of bleach when officers stopped him,..."

"The S&P 500 on Monday dropped into its second bear market of the pandemic, crossing a symbolic and worrisome threshold as stocks plunge following a meteoric rise over the last two years.
Bear markets — when stocks decline at least 20 percent from their recent peaks — are relatively rare, and they frequently precede a recession. This sell-off, dragging the S&P down from a peak on Jan. 3 (which reflects the new bear market’s starting point), comes as concerns mount over high inflation, the war in Ukraine, Covid and the Federal Reserve’s..."
"The US Department of Defense said on Friday it was cancelling the construction of parts of former president Donald Trump’s border wall with Mexico that were being built using military funds.
All unobligated money was being returned to military, the Pentagon said.
Trump declared a national emergency in 2019, in an effort to redirect funding to build a wall along the southern border.
Joe Biden issued a proclamation on 20 January, his first day in office, ordering a freeze on border wall projects and directing a review of the legality..."
"If implemented, President Joe Biden's New American Jobs Plan would rank not only as one of the biggest engines for creating good jobs (many of them in construction, which average about $30 an hour) but also as the nation’s most ambitious effort so far to curb greenhouse gas emissions — and put the country on a path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The plan covers a lot of ground, including $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and shift consumers away from gas-powered cars — funding half a million charging..."
"Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday announced that the Justice Department will conduct a 30-day internal review to determine how the agency can bolster the tracking and prosecutions of hate crimes and bias incidents motivated around race, gender and other factors.
In his first executive memo to staff since taking office, Garland said hate crimes have a “toxic effect” on society and emphasized that reports of rising discrimination and violence aimed at Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic required “renewed energy and emphasis” from the federal law enforcement agency."
"Citing an ""urgent"" need to reset hate crime enforcement strategy, Attorney General Merrick Garland launched a 30-day review Tuesday to assess the government's tracking capabilities and prosecution of hate offenses that are surging across the country.

"(CNN) - The Trump administration is dramatically increasing fees for dozens of immigration and work applications, including a more than 80 percent increase on naturalization applications and a first-time fee for asylum applicants.
US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency responsible for the country's immigration and naturalization system, updated and finalized its fee structure after a nearly nine month review.
The agency increased the cost of online naturalization applications from $640 to $1,160. The naturalization fee will represent the full cost to process the application, the agency says, plus..."
"President Trump didn't take long to fire back at his former political opponent Hillary Clinton, one day after his provocative speech at the United Nations that threatened North Korea's existence. In the early morning hours on Wednesday, Trump blamed Clinton for North Korea's nuclear program in a tweet insinuating that the former Secretary of State did not do enough when she was the nation's top diplomat. He posted that Clinton, who he again called ""Crooked Hillary,"" is criticizing only now after ""allowing"" the country to ""research and build"" nuclear weapons."
"The Senate is moving toward a historic showdown that may reverberate for years to come.
The looming battle over President Donald Trump’s upcoming Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is already turning into an ugly partisan brawl, with Senate Democrats warning they’ll retaliate if they win control of the chamber and White House on Nov. 3."
"An influential federal advisory panel overwhelmingly rejected a plan Friday to give Pfizer COVID-19 booster shots to most Americans, but it endorsed the extra shots for those who are 65 or older or run a high risk of severe disease.
The twin votes represented a heavy blow to the Biden administration’s sweeping effort to shore up nearly all Americans’ protection amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant.
The decision was made by a committee of outside experts who advise the Food and Drug Administration."
"In an all-day FDA advisory meeting, experts unanimously recommended a coronavirus vaccine booster be authorized for people 65 and older and those at high risk of severe disease. The panel earlier resoundingly voted against approving Pfizer’s application for a broader approval of boosters for everyone 16 and older.
Expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration are meeting Friday on the increasingly contentious issue of coronavirus vaccine boosters, the first phase of what could be a multiday effort to come up with government policy on who should get the extra..."
"As the United Nations climate conference opens in Egypt, the most critical talks will likely focus on the soaring costs of limiting — and adapting to — global warming, especially in the world's most vulnerable countries. It's a contentious conversation more than a decade in the making.
In 2009, industrialized countries pledged to provide developing nations with $100 billion a year in climate financing by 2020. The agreement is rooted in the fact that developed countries generated most of the heat-trapping pollution now in the atmosphere, while developing nations have..."

"On a late August day in an industrial corner of Baltimore that had been mostly silenced by the pandemic, a red-brick manufacturing plant was buzzing with activity. Deep in the building, in a zone called Area 3, the stainless steel shell of a bioreactor lay on its side, having just arrived from Massachusetts. Employees had begun the task of making the bioreactor operational. Within weeks it would be the center of a production line for coronavirus vaccines."
"As candidates enter the final weeks of what has been a fierce campaign season ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, there's no shortage of talk about who has raised the most money and what they're doing with it. 
Fundraising forms a vital part of both parties' battle to win seats in the House and the Senate. It determines how many ads a campaign can afford to produce and run, how many staffers they can afford to employ, and how aggressive they can be with mailing and canvasing efforts.

The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, in an announcement late Tuesday, said that “pursuant to a subpoena,” Mueller has agreed to appear before both panels on July 17. Mueller, who oversaw the 22-month inquiry, is perhaps the one person lawmakers and the nation have been wanting..."
"There are few people who have believed in President Trump as firmly and unapologetically as Stephen K. Bannon, his former top White House adviser and top campaign strategist. And Bannon swore in a ""60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday that he would stand by Trump and fight, from the outside, against those he thinks are steering the president in a bad direction."
"It took a while, but the Republican race has finally gotten down and dirty as you knew it must. Aside from the very real frustration of dealing with fools, clowns and oddballs dominating the large pack of candidates, at some point someone was going to have to go mano a mano with Donald Trump. Looks like first up is Jeb Bush."
"Ukraine's embattled leader accused Russia of war crimes and ""state terrorism"" Tuesday after a fresh blast struck the heart of the country's second-largest city, fueling fears civilians would face the brunt of an intensifying assault.
As the conflict escalated on its sixth day, Russia hit major cities across Ukraine with increasingly heavy shelling while a vast convoy of its forces threatened the capital.

"Donald Trump said Capitol riot instigators and the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer were ""fake"" in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday.
The former president made the comments after talking about the January 6 Congressional hearings, which he called a ""one-sided witch hunt."" 
""As another example, the sting they did involving Gretchen Whitmer was fake. Just like those who instigated January 6. It was a fake deal. Fake. It was a fake deal,"" Trump said.
""Gretchen Whitmer was in less danger..."
"President Barack Obama will delay plans to issue an executive order on immigration until the end of the year, heeding the warnings of Democratic senators who feared a voter backlash ahead of the November elections.
The decision is a major reversal from June, when the president stood in the Rose Garden and pledged to make fixes to the immigration system by the end of the summer. The delay reflected growing Democratic concerns that a sweeping executive order would further endanger the Senate majority."
"President Obama has delayed action to reshape the nation’s immigration system without congressional approval until after the November elections, bowing to the concerns of Senate Democrats on the ballots, White House officials said on Saturday.
The decision is a striking reversal of Mr. Obama’s vow to take action on immigration soon after summer’s end. The president made that promise on June 30, standing in the Rose Garden, where he angrily denounced Republ"
"As activists continue their calls for President Barack Obama to suspend deportations, Republicans warned Tuesday that doing so could kill the chances for a more permanent solution.
""If you stop enforcing the law, that would build into the narrative that you can't trust him,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said, referring to Obama. ""If he stopped deporting people who are clearly here illegally, then I think any chance of immigration reform is dead.""

"On Nov. 9, the Biden-Harris transition team announced the members of its COVID-19 advisory board, and met with them for several hours in a virtual conference before President-elect Joe Biden made remarks stressing the importance of mask wearing as a continued “weapon” in the fight against COVID-19.
“As we work toward a safe and effective vaccine, the single most effective way to stop the spread of COVID-19: wear a mask,” Biden said, as he held up his own mask. “The head of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control] warned this..."

"New Mexico Democrats kept control of the U.S. House seat left vacant by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, in one of the party's earliest tests of its messaging during the administration of President Biden.
Melanie Stansbury has defeated Republican opponent Mark Moores, according to a race call from The Associated Press.
The victory was expected. Polls showed Stansbury with a comfortable lead, and Biden won the district by 23 percentage points last year.
But the expectations were not an indication to Democrats to take their foot off the gas in the..."
"Democrat Melanie Stansbury claimed a resounding victory Tuesday night in a contested special election for Congress in New Mexico, easing her party’s fears of a closer result that could have portended a brutal midterm next year.
Stansbury, a state representative, led Republican Mark Moores, 63 percent to 33 percent, when The Associated Press called the race in her favor, a little more than an hour after polls closed. While that margin was likely to narrow somewhat as additional votes were tallied, Democrats hailed her comfortable win as a sign that their base enthusiasm has..."
"David Branch is making some changes to his Fourth of July celebration menu this year.
""I'm not doing ribs. I'm not doing beef brisket and other things that probably I would normally do,"" Branch said.
He's not alone. Rising inflation means that it's gotten more expensive to stock a party with the holiday's classic foods — about 11% more expensive than last year, to be exact. That's according to a new study that Branch co-authored, which calculated how much prices have risen for certain Fourth of July foods for a 10-person party...."
"The U.S. government has evacuated more than 800 American citizens from Afghanistan since the Taliban swept to power and U.S. troops officially left the country last August, according to data provided by House GOP investigators and the State Department.
The figure, which hasn’t been previously reported, highlights the ongoing nature of the efforts to make contact with and ultimately evacuate hundreds of Americans who were unable to leave Afghanistan as the U.S. military rapidly withdrew from the country last summer.
The data also underscores that hundreds more Americans were left..."

"The Department of Homeland Security released a report saying that China intentionally delayed telling the World Health Organization about the coronavirus because they wanted to stockpile masks and ventilators.
The report was first released to the Associated Press, but Politico’s Betsy Woodruff Swan noted that there was just “moderate confidence” in the claim."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.
Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo..."
"Russia blamed authorities in Kiev on Monday for the violence in eastern Ukraine, accusing them of trying to ignite a civil war in a region where pro-Russian militants have been defying the central government.
The warning came as Vice President Biden arrived Monday in the Ukrainian capital for a two-day visit to meet with political leaders, civil society groups and U.S. diplomats. He is bringing U.S. economic assistance, as well as warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin that future intervention in Ukraine’s volatile east will incur new costs."
"Russia accused the Ukrainian government of failing to rein in extremists as escalating tensions threaten to undermine a diplomatic accord reached last week and stoke calls in the U.S. for economic sanctions.
Ukrainian and Russian officials traded accusations about responsibility for attacks that killed three during the weekend. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow called on the U.S. to hold the Ukrainian authorities accountable for observing the agreement signed in Geneva, which calls for all illegal groups to disarm and seized buildings to be returned."

"For almost two years, colleges and universities have struggled to cope with COVID-19. Now, at the end of the fall term, the terrain is once again shifting.
On Dec. 10, following a substantial spike in coronavirus cases, Middlebury College shifted to remote instruction and sent students home early. The following week, after over 900 students tested positive, many with the Omicron variant, Cornell University moved finals online and canceled all in-person gatherings. In the face of rising cases, New York University also canceled all “non-essential” gatherings, Princeton University moved its final exams online and DePaul University..."
"ROSWELL, Ga. — Jon Ossoff, a Democrat making his first bid for elective office, narrowly missed winning a heavily conservative House district in Georgia outright on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.

The president left the White House for his Christmas getaway at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday afternoon.

In morning tweets, Trump said he might take up House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on a suggestion she made over the weekend. Trump also claimed the rules of the inquiry had been “rigged” by Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has summoned four..."
"Louisiana's Republican state senators Tuesday narrowly voted to overturn Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards' rejection of a bill prohibiting transgender students from participating in school sports, on the opening day of the first veto session under the state's nearly 50-year-old constitution.
But, with that debate shifting to the House for a final decision, it appeared the transgender sports ban might be the only veto that could be overridden in the historic gathering of the majority-GOP House and Senate
Senators blocked efforts to override a separate measure that would remove the permitting requirements, background check and..."

"Gov. Bobby Jindal, who became Louisiana’s first nonwhite governor since Reconstruction but whose popularity has plummeted as the state struggled with a $1.6 billion shortfall, announced on Wednesday that he is running for president in 2016.
Mr. Jindal, 44, who became the nation’s first Indian-American governor when he took office in 2008, joins the crowded field of Republican contenders in what even his supporters call a long-shot candidacy in which he faces several disadvantages."
"With the long-awaited Senate report on the use of torture by the United States government — a detailed account that will shed an unsparing light on the Central Intelligence Agency’s darkest practices after the September 2001 terrorist attacks — set to be released Tuesday, the Obama administration and its Republican critics clashed over the wisdom of making it public, and the risk that it will set off a backlash overseas."
"An inscription on the lobby wall greets visitors in Latin at the offices of the New York City medical examiner. It is an adage familiar to places where autopsies are performed.

"The Senate whisked a $40 billion package of military, economic and food aid for Ukraine and U.S. allies to final congressional approval Thursday, putting a bipartisan stamp on America’s biggest commitment yet to turning Russia’s invasion into a painful quagmire for Moscow.
The legislation, approved 86-11, was backed by every voting Democrat and most Republicans. While many issues under President Joe Biden have collapsed under party-line gridlock, Thursday’s lopsided vote signaled that both parties were largely unified about sending Ukraine the materiel it needs to fend off Russian President Vladimir Putin’s more numerous forces.

"In the 14 years since the 9/11 attacks, the face of terrorism has changed out of recognition. To many experts, the threat of Islamist terror is in some ways greater and in some ways diminished. It is geographically more diverse and organizationally more divided, and leverages social media and the internet in a way impossible in 2001."
"President Donald Trump on Friday, gearing up for his first campaign rally in months in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday, threatened any protesters who show up outside or try to disrupt the event, saying “it will be a much different scene” than how they've been dealt with in ""New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis.""

Those companies are now attempting to explain why they paid Cohen—or, that is, attempting to explain why they paid him without using the words bribery and/or cash-for-access contribution to a sleazy hush-money slush fund—and the results are, simply put,..."

"The religious right remains the largest voting bloc in the Republican Party, and that gives Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, the potential to play a big role in the presidential nominating contest.
But Mr. Huckabee, who was set to announce his presidential bid Tuesday morning, will have a harder time winning Iowa than he did in 2008, when religious conservatives had serious reservations about the two main candidates, John McCain and Mitt Romney.
This year’s conservative favorites do not have Mr. Romney’s vulnerabilities among evangelicals, like Mormonism or past..."

Politico Magazine has published an annual worst political predictions list twice before, but we’ve never had quite the fodder that we did this year.

"The violent aftermath of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, continues to hover over the presidential race. When Joe Biden spoke in Pittsburgh on Monday, he denounced the chaos that followed protests last week—and then swiveled to assess the president’s role in the turmoil. Donald Trump then addressed the events in Kenosha on Tuesday. When a reporter brought up the protests pressing for an end to systemic racism, Trump insisted that the topic of the day was not racism but violence, blaming the unrest on Democrats and..."
"THE SOUND OF glass breaking, on Inauguration Day in Portland, Oregon, was music to the ears of Julio Rosas, a young video journalist.
That’s because Rosas, who works for the right-wing website Townhall, specializes in shooting viral video of mayhem at left-wing protests. On this day, black-clad, anti-capitalist protesters were attacking a Democratic Party office, and Rosas managed to record them from close range without being spotted.
Within minutes of the vandalism, by a handful of activists who broke off from a small #J20 march, Rosas posted his video on..."
"Glenn Greenwald took to Twitter on Thursday to criticize the publication he co-founded for attacking a group of conservative reporters who recorded last year’s racial protests.
“The Intercept is now actively targeting two journalists of color,” Greenwald wrote. “They have two white male reporters here putting a target on their backs for the crime of reporting on Antifa riots. This is genuinely disgusting and dangerous. Press freedom groups should condemn this.”
He was referencing a column published Thursday morning by the publication’s Robert Mackey and Travis Mannon in which the..."
"Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech will supply 100 million more doses of their coronavirus vaccine to the United States by this summer after protracted negotiations over how much the companies could deliver, given their commitments to other nations.
The $1.95 billion agreement doubles the overall U.S. order for the vaccine to 200 million doses. Pfizer and BioNTech said they can supply 70 million doses by June 30, 2021, with the remaining 30 million doses delivered by the end of July."
"The Trump administration on Wednesday released its most detailed plan yet for distributing and administering millions of doses of a future coronavirus vaccine to Americans for free.
The plan consists of an information campaign led by the Department of Health and Human Services public affairs department; ramping up infrastructure so a vaccine can be delivered “immediately” once authorized; and sending 6.6 million kits of supplies needed to administer the vaccine, like syringes and alcohol pads."
"WASHINGTON – The Green New Deal, Democrats' aspirational proposal to confront climate change and address social justice, died Tuesday in the Senate.
And Democrats helped slay it.
No senator voted for it; 57 (including all Republicans and a handful of Democrats) voted against it; and the remaining 43 (all Democrats) voted ""present"" as a protest.
The vote was on a procedural matter to continue debate on the bill crafted by liberal firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. At least 60 votes were needed to keep the bill moving, meaning the legislation is..."
"The Senate on Tuesday voted down a procedural measure to advance the Green New Deal, a wide-reaching proposal that would address climate change.
The final tally was 0-57.
Forty-three Democrats voted ""present"" in protest of the measure, even though many of them have said that they support the framework of the resolution. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Angus King of Maine, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Doug Jones of Alabama voted no with the Republicans.
Ahead of the vote, Senate Democrats blasted the vote as a “sham.” Democratic..."

Couric's documentary, Under the Gun, shows her interviewing members of a gun rights organization, the Virginia Citizens Defense League. She asks activists from the group, ""If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?""
The documentary then shows the silent faces of the activists, giving the impression that they were stumped by the question,..."
"The hard-fought Democratic Senate primary in Hawaii was too close to call early Sunday morning, with the incumbent clinging to a slight lead and residents in a pair of storm-ravaged precincts yet to cast their ballots.
With all but two of the state’s 247 precincts reporting, Sen. Brian Schatz had a 1,786-vote advantage over Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, 49.4 percent to 48.6 percent, according to The Associated Press."
"After nearly four decades in elected office in Hawaii, Gov. Neil Abercrombie was dealt a stunning defeat in his bid for re-election over the weekend, becoming the first incumbent governor in the state’s history to lose in his party’s primary.
Mr. Abercrombie, a Democrat, was defeated Saturday by David Ige, who began the campaign as a little-known state senator but capitalized on the governor’s sinking popularity to win the nomination.
The race will almost certainly mark the end of Mr. Abercrombie’s long political career. At age 76, he collected only..."

"President Joe Biden got his COVID-19 booster shot before news cameras Monday as his administration promotes new booster guidance that has spurred some confusion among Americans on when to get a third dose.
""Like I did with my first and second COVID-19 vaccination shot, I'm about to get my booster shot and do it publicly. That's because the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, the CDC, looked at all the data, completed their review, and determined the boosters for the Pfizer vaccine --..."
"In recent weeks, as protests against police violence have spread nationwide in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, TV critics and others who cover the medium have raised a frequent refrain: Cancel all the cop shows.
Kelly Lawler, TV critic for USA Today, wrote an excellent piece that summarized the problem as one of overrepresentation. There are so many cop shows, and most of them depict police officers as brave, stalwart heroes. It’s inevitable that the idea of the police as effective guardians of the public, constantly and..."
"It’s probably not the scales of justice or a police badge, but rather the red-and-blue logo of NBC’s long-running cop and lawyer drama.
The series and its many spinoffs, created by Dick Wolf, are among dozens of TV series about law enforcement. From “Dragnet” to “NYPD Blue” to “FBI,” the cop show is a prolific American institution that is immensely influential. In the 2019-2020 TV season, three of the top five dramas were cop shows, according to Nielsen. With 21 seasons and at least three more on the way, NBC’s..."
"About a year and a half ago, I wrote a piece here about a phenomenon I called The Great Whitebread Hope, which is an ongoing Republican establishment fantasy of electing an upper-midwestern “reformer” in the LaFollete tradition who can bring together all the disparate factions of the party and offer up an image of respectable, mature, pragmatic leadership (and incidentally pick up some badly needed electoral votes from somewhere)."
"President Trump gave an early look Saturday at how he intends to help Republicans maintain control of Congress in 2018. Trump delivered his midterms message during a campaign rally near Pittsburgh, Penn. — a rally that he held to help a Republican struggling to hold onto a House district Trump won by double digits in 2016."
"President Joe Biden, speaking to nation Tuesday, gave his fiercest defense yet of his self-imposed deadline to withdraw the U.S. military from Afghanistan -- a day after the last troops left the country, bringing America's longest war to a close -- but only after a chaotic and deadly exit.
""Let me be clear, leaving August the 31st, is not due to an arbitrary deadline. It was designed to save American lives,"" a defiant Biden said, responding to harsh criticism both of his decision to leave and how it was handled...."

Taiwanese media showed the delegation arriving for the talks, but details of the meeting were not immediately released. The delegation was due to depart later Monday on a U.S. government plane.
The visit came less than two weeks after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, which prompted days..."
"Democrats can see glimmers of new midterm life, after the stunning defeat of an anti-abortion measure in Kansas. Eric Greitens is the big loser in Missouri — which means the Republican Party as a whole won. And in Michigan, Rep. Peter Meijer has conceded in a primary fueled by his vote to impeach former President Donald Trump.
Votes are still being counted in some of the most important races. But as the multi-state primary made its return on Tuesday after a summer hiatus, the shape of the general election landscape..."
"Watching the news or browsing social media, it would be easy to think that critical race theory is a complicated, controversial, or new idea.
But critical race theory, created four decades ago by legal scholars, is an academic framework for examining how racism is embedded in America’s laws and institutions. It is just now receiving widespread attention because it has morphed into a catchall category, one used by Republicans who want to ban anti-racist teachings and trainings in classrooms and workplaces across the country.
Over the past six months, Republicans..."
"On Monday, Capt. Brett Crozier, the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, sent a letter to the Navy pleading for permission to unload his crew, including scores of sailors sickened with Covid-19, in Guam, where it was docked. The Pentagon had been dragging its feet, and the situation on the ship was growing dire.
“We are not at war,” he wrote. “Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our sailors.”"
"The Congressional Budget Office said it sees the U.S. economy recovering from the coronavirus pandemic much faster than previously expected -- an upgrade that potentially complicates prospects for President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief plan.
The CBO, a nonpartisan arm of the legislature, forecasts gross domestic product will increase 1.7% annually from 2020-2024, according to its economic outlook released Monday. That’s a 0.7 percentage point increase from the previous expectation released in July, months before Covid-19 vaccines were shown to be effective and approved for use, which put the pandemic’s..."
"President Trump’s pick to run the CIA, Gina Haspel, told White House officials last week that she would withdraw her nomination if they were concerned her role in the brutal interrogation of a Qaeda suspect would scuttle her confirmation and draw the intelligence agency into a fresh controversy over a program it disavowed years ago, according to administration officials and others familiar with the discussions."
"Theresa May has bowed to intense pressure from her own party and named 7 June as the day she will step aside as Conservative leader, drawing her turbulent three-year premiership to a close.
Speaking in Downing Street, May said it had been “the honour of my life” to serve as Britain’s second female prime minister. Her voice breaking, she said she would leave “with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love”.
The prime minister listed a series..."

The United States is the first country to greenlight use of Moderna's vaccine, which was developed in part with the National Institutes of Health.
The news was met with optimism. ""I've never been more hopeful that we will eventually turn the corner on this pandemic,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and current president of the..."

"An unexpected new effort by Greece to compromise with its creditors on a bailout package prompted a cool response from most of the rest of Europe on Wednesday as the financial pressures on Athens intensified and efforts to find a way out of the crisis remained chaotic.
On another day of twists and turns, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government reversed course and said it would be willing to accept many of the terms of a bailout package that it had previously rejected, if they are part of a broader deal..."
"Hiring surged in July, with U.S. employers creating 528,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday. That far exceeded economist expectations for gains of 250,000 new jobs during the period. It was also a jump from the previous month, when businesses added 372,000 jobs despite the highest inflation in 40 years. 
The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% from 3.6% in June, marking the lowest since February 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S. Before the latest payrolls report, the economy was adding roughly 450,000 jobs per month.

"After weeks of going quiet on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the anti-malarial drug he used to tout as a ""game-changer"" for the coronavirus, President Trump startled everyone yesterday by announcing that he was taking it himself.
This announcement eclipsed the rest of the day's news, which may be one reason Trump brought the topic up again.
The comments also triggered the same widespread condemnation the President received in the weeks he was talking up the drug in press conferences.
One aspect of this criticism is fair. Hydroxychloroquine can have dangerous side effects,..."
"The Food and Drug Administration has already warned: “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.” In its public warning (necessitated in part by President Trump’s hyping of a dangerous drug) the FDA explained, “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia. These risks may increase when these medicines are combined with other medicines known to prolong the QT interval, including the antibiotic azithromycin, which is also..."

"A bulk of gun law changes took effect in Texas on Sunday, loosening restrictions just one day after a mass shooting near Odessa and Midland left at least 5 people dead.
The laws open more opportunities for Texans to have firearms and store ammunition in public places.
From churches to public schools to foster homes, the laws also loosen restrictions on where a firearm is permitted.
The laws were already set to take effect Sept. 1 but come just one day after a routine traffic stop on Interstate 20..."
"Governor Gavin Newsom announced with state legislative leaders that they have agreed on a budget that will provide stimulus payments to most Californians.
Most Californians would receive stimulus payments ranging from $200 to $350 per person under a budget deal that Gov. Gavin Newsom and state legislative leaders announced Sunday night.
Tax refunds under the agreement’s $17 billion “inflation relief package” would provide $350 to individuals making less than $75,000 per year. Couples making less than $150,000 who file their taxes together would receive $700. If families in those categories..."
"President Trump on Saturday attacked a federal judge who temporarily blocked his immigration order, calling him a “so-called judge” whose “ridiculous” ruling would be overturned.
In an early-morning Twitter message from his waterfront Florida resort, where he is spending the weekend, Mr. Trump wrote, “The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!”"
"Senator Ted Cruz has long cheered Donald J. Trump’s presence in the Republican presidential field, thanking him for focusing national attention on issues like border security.
Speaking to donors in New York City on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz suggested a more strategic reason to be grateful: Mr. Trump is bending the race in Mr. Cruz’s direction.
“He has framed the central narrative of this primary as, ‘Who will stand up to Washington?’ ” Mr. Cruz, of Texas, said at the private fund-raiser, echoing remarks he has made publicly. “Now if that’s..."
"Donald Trump didn’t hit back hard at Ted Cruz, but he couldn’t let the Texas senator’s dismissive private comments about his candidacy, which surfaced this week, go by without taking a shot.
Or two.
Trump, speaking to a crowd of several hundred people inside an auditorium at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, mocked Cruz, who has been remarkably deferential to Trump. Earlier Friday, Cruz sought to assuage Trump by tweeting that the billionaire mogul is a “great guy” and that the media is trying to spark a fight between..."
"Georgia election officials disputed a video promoted by President Donald Trump’s campaign as evidence of election fraud, saying the footage shows nothing but ""normal ballot processing.""
The surveillance video was introduced as proof of illegal activity by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team during a Dec. 3 hearing with Georgia state legislators. The Trump campaign then circulated One America News Network’s live coverage of the event online.
Social media posts sharing the video were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court has made it more difficult for women to get access to birth control as part of their health plans if their employer has a religious or moral objections to contraceptives.
The opinion upheld a Trump administration rule that significantly cut back on the Affordable Care Act requirement that insurers provide free birth control coverage as part of almost all health care plans.
Under the ACA, churches and synagogues were automatically exempted from the birth control insurance mandate. Not automatically exempt, however, were non-profits like religiously affiliated..."
"The justices upheld regulations from the Trump administration that allowed employers with religious objections to decline to provide contraception coverage.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Trump administration regulation that lets employers with religious objections limit women’s access to free birth control under the Affordable Care Act.
As a consequence of the ruling, about 70,000 to 126,000 women could lose contraceptive coverage from their employers, according to government estimates.
The vote was 7 to 2, with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissenting.
Contraception coverage has emerged as..."

“He’s got to condemn this [shit] Asap. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,” Donald Trump Jr. texted, one of a series of messages Meadows provided to the Jan. 6 select committee investigating the former president’s effort to overturn the election."
"Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention published a 205-page list Thursday evening of hundreds of ministers and other church workers it described as being “credibly accused” of sexual abuse.
The list’s public release is one of the first definitive steps the denomination’s leadership has taken in the wake of a nearly 300-page report about its handling of alleged sexual abuse over the last 20 years."
"Hurricane Laura pounded the Louisiana and Texas coasts as it made landfall near Cameron, La., as a Category 4 storm early Thursday, delivering a barrage of 150-mile-an-hour winds and massive storm surge. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, but remained destructive, with strong winds and heavy rain, and forecasters said it could spawn tornadoes.
At 8 a.m. Central time, the storm was centered between Leesville and Natchitoches, La., about 110 miles north of the Gulf Coast and 80 miles south of Shreveport, with hurricane-force winds extending out 60 miles..."
"President Trump announced the federal government is sending 150 million rapid care tests to governors to distribute as they deem fit. Governors are encouraged to use them to screen at schools and in high-risk settings, the president said in a Rose Garden event.
But the president had already announced that would be happening in August, before accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention.
The update on the nation's coronavirus testing strategy comes one day after a bombshell report from the New York Times provided an in-depth look..."
"After this pandemic passes, there must be a profound reckoning. I’m not referring to President Trump’s abysmal performance in the crisis; the election in November will render citizens’ judgment on that. No, there must be a reckoning with the profound failure of the United States’ domestic and foreign policies and priorities, a failure that was apparent even before covid-19 revealed the catastrophic bankruptcy of our national security strategy.
Less than 30 years ago, with the end of the Soviet Union, the United States basked in the role of the world’s..."
"The small business rescue fund set up by Congress exhausted its $350 billion funding capacity Thursday morning, as U.S. lawmakers remained mired in a battle over providing more money.
Congressional Democrats continued their talks with the Trump administration on Thursday on whether there's a deal that can pass Congress unanimously. Without additional funding, banks and the Small Business Administration will be unable to approve more of the Paycheck Protection Program loans designed to avert layoffs during the coronavirus pandemic, which can be forgiven if businesses agree to maintain their payrolls."
"NEW YORK (AP) — The government’s lending program for small businesses is on hold.
The Small Business Administration said Thursday that it reached the $349 billion lending limit for the program, after approving nearly 1.7 million loans.
Thousands of small business owners whose loans have not yet been processed must now wait for Congress to approve a Trump administration request for another $250 billion for the program. Lawmakers have been haggling over whether to extend the program as it stands now, or whether to add provisions that, among other things,..."
"Former President Donald Trump injected some last-minute confusion ahead of Missouri's Senate primary on Tuesday by endorsing ""ERIC"" in a Monday night statement.
Eric who? Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens? State Attorney General Eric Schmitt? Or maybe even little-known Eric McElroy?
“I trust the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds, much as they did when they gave me landslide victories in the 2016 and 2020 Elections, and I am therefore proud to announce that ERIC has my Complete and Total Endorsement!” Trump said in a statement after..."
"The ""Pope Francis supports evolution"" story is just the latest example of the press getting the Catholic Church completely wrong. It is official: the media has gone bananas in its coverage of Pope Francis. The OMG-Pope-Francis-Supports-Evolution story of the past two days is just the latest example. Almost every news outlet, major and minor, has plastered Pope Francis’ name across the interwebs and proclaimed he has finally planted the Catholic Church in the evolution camp of the creation-evolution debate. The only problem? Almost every outlet has got the story wrong,..."
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she would create a select committee to further investigate the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan effort to form an independent commission of experts to look into the riot.
“Jan. 6 was a day of darkness for our country,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters. “Our temple of democracy was attacked by insurrectionists.”
The move came after Ms. Pelosi had signaled for weeks that she planned to take such a step to scrutinize the storming of the Capitol..."
"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted in defense of Vice President Kamala Harris hours after a critical report alleged ""exasperation and dysfunction"" going on in her office.
""For anyone who needs to hear it. @VP is not only a vital partner to @POTUS but a bold leader who has taken on key, important challenges facing the country—from voting rights to addressing root causes of migration to expanding broadband,"" Psaki wrote in a tweet Sunday night.
The tweet followed a report from CNN that said many of Harris' aides feel she is being sidelined by..."
"President Joe Biden says he intends to run for reelection in 2024. But not all Democrats believe him. Nor are they convinced his No. 2 would be the clear heir if he did choose to opt out.
As Vice President Kamala Harris grapples with a portfolio of seemingly intractable issues and responsibilities that have drawn her away from the national spotlight — she Zoomed into the infrastructure Cabinet meeting from Paris on Friday — other Democrats have raised their own national profiles.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is the point person..."
"A bipartisan group of senators expressed confidence Monday in their proposal for major immigration reform. But after the last big congressional push failed in 2007, many are asking why it would work this time around.
""Elections. Elections,"" Republican Sen. John McCain said Monday in a press conference, when CNN's Dana Bash asked what was behind the optimism. ""The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens and we realize that there are many issues on which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens but this..."
"President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that he hopes immigration reform can be passed into law by June, but in the meantime he has no plans to halt or slow deportations, despite pleas from advocates.
Obama gave interviews to two Spanish-language outlets, Univision and Telemundo, on Wednesday, the day after he delivered a major speech on immigration reform. He argued that much of the legislative work on the issue is already done, given years of work by a number of members of Congress and his own administration. Now, the struggle..."
"It was quite a month for young Madison Cawthorn.
The 26-year-old Republican congressman from North Carolina was caught bringing a loaded gun through airport security, his second such incident. Police released footage of him getting pulled over for driving with expired tags and being told to surrender his revoked license. The Washington Examiner reported allegations against him of insider trading. Politico published photos of him partying while wearing women’s lingerie. And a former congressional aide filed a workplace complaint against him."
"If you have school-age children, chances are they've already talked to their classmates about the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. So what's the best way to know how they're feeling and what they're thinking? Ask them.
""Children's questions may be very different from adults',"" says David Schonfeld, a pediatrician who directs the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. And the best way to determine how much information they need is to listen to them, he says.
""Before we can offer reassurance or help them with what's bothering..."
"Pope Francis apologized to Indigenous peoples on Monday and asked for forgiveness for the “evil committed by so many Christians” against them in Canada’s brutal residential school system. 
“I am sorry,” the pope said, while addressing Indigenous elders and residential school survivors at a former residential school site in Maskwacis, Alberta, about 100 kilometres south of Edmonton. 
“I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the Indigenous peoples,” he said in Spanish, his mother tongue. The apology was translated into English and multiple Indigenous languages...."
"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced trip to Ukraine Thursday -- paying his second visit to the country's capital city since the war with Russia began more than six months ago.
While in Kyiv, Blinken met with top officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, and visited a children's hospital.
""President Biden has been clear we will support the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. I reiterated this message to President Zelenskyy and his team today in Kyiv, which remains --..."
"The United States has concluded that Russia violated a landmark arms control treaty by testing a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile, according to senior American officials, a finding that was conveyed by President Obama to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a letter on Monday.
It is the most serious allegation of an arms control treaty violation that the Obama administration has leveled against Russia and adds another dispute to a relationship already burdened by tensions over the Kremlin’s support for separatists in Ukraine and its decision to grant asylum..."
"Three weeks before America elects a president amid a pandemic and with Democrats condemning the process, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday set about advancing a Supreme Court justice who could serve for decades to come.
The result appeared preordained as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the committee chairman, said at the outset. But over four days, conservative federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett appears certain to face tough questions in her quest to succeed the late liberal Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
""This is a vacancy that occurred..."
"Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearings are set to enter into their next phase on Tuesday, with the 48-year-old nominee due to answer questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee in person for the first time since her nomination last month. Barrett is expected to take questions about her past statements on abortion and the role of precedent, her views on an upcoming case over the Affordable Care Act and whether she will recuse herself from litigation stemming from the upcoming election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe..."
"A bus emblazoned with the United States Air Force logo was idling outside the Capitol on Thursday, members of Congress on board, ready to depart for Joint Base Andrews and a waiting military aircraft. Inside, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in her office making final preparations to lead the congressional delegation on a secret visit to American troops in Afghanistan with a stop in Brussels."
"President Joe Biden on Friday vowed to evacuate all Afghan allies of the United States seeking to flee Afghanistan, extending the same commitment he made earlier this week to Americans still stranded in the Taliban-controlled country.
“There’s no one more important than bringing American citizens out, I acknowledge that. But they’re equally important, almost,” Biden told reporters following an address at the White House, referring to the thousands of interpreters and other Afghan personnel who aided the two-decade U.S. war effort."
"At a political rally in Alabama on Friday, President Trump had clear advice for N.F.L. owners if one of their players followed the lead of Colin Kaepernick, the former Super Bowl quarterback who last season began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police injustice against minorities. “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” he suggested."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden finally got the win he needed.
After nearly a month of underperforming in Iowa and New Hampshire, and finishing in a distant second in Nevada, Biden sealed a definitive win in the South Carolina primary, with black voters pushing him to victory. It's the first primary win ever for Biden, who is running for president for the third time.
According to exit polls, 64% of black voters supported Biden. Sen. Bernie Sanders came in a distant second with black voters at 15%, followed closely by..."
"The Palmetto State came through big for former Vice President Joe Biden, and it couldn’t have come at a more critical time for his presidential ambitions.
With his campaign struggling to raise funds and Super Tuesday looming next week, Biden badly needed a win to reverse the narrative that he was on the ropes. He finally got it on Saturday, according to cable news projections.
It was the 77-year-old’s first primary victory after three separate presidential runs over three decades ― and he owed it in large part due to..."
"The American oil industry is facing a doomsday scenario.
The coronavirus pandemic has caused oil demand to drop so rapidly that the world is running out of room to store barrels. At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia flooded the world with excess supply.
That double black swan has caused oil prices to collapse to levels that make it impossible for US shale oil companies to make money. US crude for May delivery turned negative on Monday -- something that has never happened since NYMEX oil futures began trading..."
"While the initial impact of Hurricane Harvey may have seemed lighter than expected from a Category 4 storm, the destruction from the lingering storm continues to grow. Mandatory evacuations have been announced in some Houston neighborhoods, as over 30 inches of rain have fallen in some areas. With another 15 to 25 inches of rain still expected in the same region, flooding has already reached catastrophic levels."
"R. Kelly, the once high-flying R&B star-turned-convicted sex offender, was convicted Wednesday by a federal jury in Chicago of another set of sex crimes, including several child pornography charges. 
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography but was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
The decision comes after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, he won’t be eligible..."
"President Donald Trump delivered a scorched-earth speech to conservative activists on Saturday, calling the Russia investigation ""bullshit,"" adopting a southern accent to mock his former attorney general, and asserting that some members of Congress ""hate our country.""
The rollicking two-hour-plus appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland offered the president a brief respite from an otherwise miserable week in which his much-touted summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ended in failure and his former personal lawyer delivered explosive testimony to Congress."
"A slickly produced 26-minute video called Plandemic has exploded on social media in recent days, claiming to present a view of COVID-19 that differs from the ""official"" narrative.
The video has been viewed millions of times on YouTube via links that are replaced as quickly as the video-sharing service can remove them for violating its policy against ""COVID-19 misinformation.""
In it, filmmaker Mikki Willis conducts an uncritical interview with Judy Mikovits, who he says has been called ""one of the most accomplished scientists of her generation."""
"If ever a person should have a good B.S. detector, one might think it would be Arthur Conan Doyle. His deathless creation, Sherlock Holmes, is perhaps the most compelling rationalist ever born. Others fall prey to confusion, coincidence, prejudice or wishful thinking. Not Holmes. The great detective sees all that is relevant, ignores everything extraneous and follows the facts using the map of cold logic.
And yet, 100 years ago, when Sir Arthur’s fame was at full flood throughout the English-speaking world, he was completely taken in by two schoolgirls..."
"Donald Trump’s eccentric presidential run is looking more like a standard campaign every day.
While his Republican rivals have been hoping that Trump’s candidacy would fade after the initial buzz died down, he remains in first in the polls even after coming down from his September peak. Meanwhile, his campaign has been building the infrastructure necessary to put up a real fight in the earliest primaries and beyond.
The latest evidence came in Thursday’s third-quarter FEC report, which showed a $3.9 million haul, mostly from small donors, and..."
"For months, Donald J. Trump has highlighted his credentials as a politician who was financing his own campaign for president.
No longer.
Mr. Trump revealed in a filing Thursday to the Federal Election Commission that the vast majority of the money he raised and spent this summer as he rose to the top of national polls came not from his own coffers, as it had in the spring, but from about $3.7 million in what he called “unsolicited contributions.” Some 74,000 donors pitched in an average of about $50 to..."
"The good news is that the worst prime minister in modern British history is going. The bad news is that he has not yet gone. Boris Johnson fought to the end to remain in Downing Street as his reputation and his government collapsed around him. On Thursday, as more ministers resigned, including one who had been in office less than 48 hours, he bowed to the inevitable, resigning as Conservative leader while remaining prime minister until a successor is chosen.
Mr Johnson went grudgingly and without grace. He left with a speech outside No..."
"Joe Biden has vowed to be a president for all Americans, even those who do not support him. In previous elections, such a promise might have sounded trite or treacly. Today, the idea that the president should have the entire nation’s interests at heart feels almost revolutionary.
Mr. Biden has also vowed to “restore the soul of America.” It is a painful reminder that the country is weaker, angrier, less hopeful and more divided than it was four years ago. With this promise, Mr. Biden is assuring the public that..."
"Former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush offered a defense of conservative Christian principles and attacked the Obama administration for failing to preserve religious freedom during his commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia.
Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans.
""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure"
"Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams sparred over health care, crime and punishment, and voting rights in a Monday debate as they made their closing arguments to voters in a reprise of their fiercely contested 2018 race for the same job.
The stakes for this night were arguably higher for Abrams, who has trailed in most recent polling of the race. Kemp, one of the few prominent Republicans to resist former President Donald Trump’s lies about a stolen election in 2020, has positioned himself as a more traditional, pro-business conservative – a..."
"News that an experimental antiviral drug from Merck appears to halve the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19 has bolstered hopes of finding a simple at-home treatment for the virus.
The drug, molnupiravir, is given as a pill. It performed well enough in a late-stage clinical trial of adults at high risk of severe Covid-19 that the independent review board overseeing the study recommended that it be ended early. Now Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics will seek FDA authorization for the drug “as soon as possible,” they said..."
"Drugmaker Merck said Friday that its experimental COVID-19 pill reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half in people recently infected with the coronavirus, potentially a leap forward in the global fight against the pandemic.
The company said it will soon ask health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize the pill’s use. A decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could come within weeks after that, and the drug, if OK’d, could be distributed quickly soon afterward.
If cleared, it would be the first pill shown to treat..."
"There is little that Jeffrey Younger and Anne Georgulas agree on about one of their twins.
To start: Is the 7-year-old transgender?
It’s a question that has divided the Coppell, Tex., parents — on how Luna, who was named James at birth, should be dressed to school and wear their hair. On whether the child should receive gender-affirming care, which could eventually lead to medical treatment to delay puberty. On which parent should get to live with the twins, and who should have a say in decisions over their health...."
"SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) — A student gunman opened fire Thursday at a Southern California high school, killing one student and wounding four other people before he was captured in grave condition after shooting himself in the head, authorities said.
The shooting occurred around 7:30 a.m. at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
Shauna Orandi, 16, said she was in her Spanish class working on homework when she heard four gunshots that she initially mistook as instruments from a band..."
"One person is dead and at least three others are injured, two of them critically, after a shooting at a Southern California high school Thursday morning, officials said.
About an hour and a half after the shooting was reported at about 8 a.m. before classes started at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, authorities said they had located the suspect who was no longer a threat.
""This is an active shooter situation,"" a tweet from the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's office said before the suspect was located. ""If you live..."
"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Postal Service workers' union endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden Friday after President Donald Trump frankly acknowledged that he's starving the USPS of money to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.
""Biden and Harris fully exhibit the experience, dedication, thoughtfulness and steady hands that will work to ensure that letter carriers and working families are put first ... The Postal Service must not be allowed to fail,"" said a letter from the National Association of Letter Carriers, which represents the 300,000..."
"BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) — Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that “no one will be safe in Biden’s America” if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .
“This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect,”″ Trump said of former Vice President Joe Biden. “And I’m telling you on Nov. 3 you’re going to be getting it back.”

"During a press conference at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump again denied multiple reports that he privately called U.S. troops who were killed in combat ""losers"" and ""suckers,"" declaring, ""only an animal would say a thing like that.""
Trump went on to tell reporters that his relationship with troops is completely different from his relationship with top military brass. ""I'm not saying the military is in love with me, the soldiers are,"" he said. Last week, a Military Times poll found that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden..."
"More than a dozen New Jersey officials, including top aides to Governor Chris Christie, were served with subpoenas on Friday as the state assembly begins its investigation into a massive bridge traffic jam that was apparently politically motivated.
Christie, seen as a likely Republican candidate for the White House in 2016, has denied any involvement in the so-called ""Bridgegate"" scandal that is dogging his second term in office."
"Gov. Chris Christie hits the road this weekend to headline private fundraisers in Florida, but the political crisis he leaves behind in New Jersey could still follow him south.
The Republican, viewed as a formidable potential presidential candidate in 2016, will likely face questions in closed-door sessions with Republicans in the Sunshine State.
He could face a crush of reporters, protesters or fans simply wanting to get a glimpse of the ""hottest"" politician in the country, whose administration is now embroiled in a scandal that could threaten his..."
"The Supreme Court has ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years in a decision by its conservative majority to overturn Roe v. Wade. Friday’s outcome is expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.
The decision, unthinkable just a few years ago, was the culmination of decades of efforts by abortion opponents, made possible by an emboldened right side of the court that has been fortified by three appointees of former President Donald Trump.
The ruling came more than a month after the stunning leak..."
"President Donald Trump will travel to Puerto Rico today -- two weeks after Hurricane Maria first struck the island. The president said he will meet with FEMA and military officials, first responders, and the people of Puerto Rico. Additionally, he said the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands will “probably” travel to Puerto Rico to meet with him."
"Republicans aren’t exactly rolling out the red carpet for Jeff Van Drew.
The New Jersey Democratic congressman may have hoped his defection to the GOP would ease his path to reelection in a conservative-leaning district. His political prospects as a Democrat had been imperiled by his opposition to impeaching President Donald Trump, which outraged activists and party officials.
But before he even officially switches parties, Van Drew is facing firm opposition from multiple Republicans who were already running for the 2nd District nomination, as well as local GOP leaders and..."
"WASHINGTON — The discovery this weekend that Russian hackers used sophisticated techniques to infiltrate a broad swath of government and corporate networks to steal sensitive information sent cybersecurity experts into a panic, leaving open the question of how the U.S. will respond.
The attribution was made on Sunday, according to one source familiar with the matter, who said the spy group responsible for the breach is known to the military and intelligence community. U.S. Cyber Command, the military combatant command charged with pursuing U.S. enemies in cyberspace, is closely involved..."
"President Trump backed off his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods and announced via Twitter on Friday night that the United States had reached an agreement with Mexico to reduce the flow of migrants to the southwestern border.

"The Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol issued a subpoena Wednesday for an ex-Justice Department official who had promised to pursue former President Donald Trump's false election fraud claims.
The official, Jeffrey Clark, was a key figure in a recent Senate report detailing Trump's attempts to enlist the department in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump had considered replacing his acting attorney general at the time, Jeffrey Rosen, with Clark, who was in a lower-ranking position.
""The Select Committee needs to understand all the..."
"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot issued a subpoena on Wednesday to Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official under President Donald J. Trump who was involved in Mr. Trump’s frenzied efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
The subpoena seeks testimony and records from Mr. Clark, a little-known official who repeatedly pushed his colleagues at the Justice Department to help Mr. Trump undo his loss. The panel’s focus on him indicates that it is deepening its scrutiny of the root causes of the attack, which disrupted a congressional session called..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman wouldn’t guarantee that two U.S. military veterans captured in Ukraine won’t face the death penalty in an exclusive interview Monday.
“It depends on the investigation,” Dmitry Peskov told NBC News senior international correspondent Keir Simmons when he was asked whether Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh would “face the same fate” as two British citizens and a Moroccan who were sentenced to death by Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine this month.
The families of Drueke, 39, and Huynh, 27, reported them missing last week. "
"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his administration faced new allegations on Friday that they had covered up the scope of the coronavirus death toll in New York’s nursing homes, after a top aide admitted that the state had withheld data because it feared an investigation by the Trump Justice Department.
The private remarks by the top aide, Melissa DeRosa, and a cascading series of news reports and a court order have left Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, scrambling to contain the political fallout over his oversight of nursing homes, where..."
"Dr. Scott Atlas, a highly controversial member of the White House's coronavirus task force, has resigned from his post in the Trump administration.
A source familiar with what happened told CNN that Atlas turned in his resignation letter to President Donald Trump on Monday. As a special government employee, Atlas had a 130-day window in which he could serve and that window was technically coming to a close this week.
Atlas tweeted out a photo of his resignation letter later Monday. In the letter, he said his ""advice was..."
"As mourners in Uvalde, Tex., prepared to bury 19 children and two teachers, elected officials vowed Monday to examine last week’s elementary school massacre and the flawed police response, and drive changes to gun laws.
President Biden, who spent nearly four hours Sunday visiting with the families of Uvalde victims, told reporters he would not give up on efforts to achieve “common-sense” gun legislation.

"Prominent social media users and conservative voices have amplified a baseless theory promoted by Russian state media accusing the United States of funding biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine.
There is no evidence to support the claims, which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have all unequivocally denied.
There are biological laboratories inside Ukraine, and since 2005, the United States has provided backing to a number of institutions to prevent the production of biological weapons. But Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and others have misleadingly cited remarks from American officials as proof that the..."
"At about 7 p.m. ET Monday, House impeachment managers delivered to the Senate an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump, a move that prompts preparations for a historic trial.
The formal step comes just over a year after the House last transmitted an impeachment measure against Trump to the upper chamber. The latest rebuke alleges that the former president incited the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.
On Tuesday, U.S. senators, who act as jurors in an impeachment trial, will be sworn in.
The trial itself will begin..."

"Hypocrisy sucks, but unveiling it can feel as satisfying as taking a gigantic gulp of ice-cold nervous sweat from the brow of a very bad man. Such is the sensation that the reporters at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette must be experiencing in the wake of the marvelous scoop they published Tuesday afternoon: Rep. Tim Murphy, a vocally anti-abortion congressman from Pennsylvania, asked his own girlfriend to terminate a pregnancy this year."
"St. Louis County police officers shot and critically injured a man who fired at them here late Sunday night, the authorities said, setting this region on another tense and uncertain course on the same day that hundreds gathered to commemorate the anniversary of the killing of Michael Brown, a black teenager, by a white officer."

"TO hear the national news media tell the story, you would think my city, El Paso, and others along the Texas-Mexico border were being overrun by children — tens of thousands of them, some with their mothers, arriving from Central America in recent months, exploiting an immigration loophole to avoid deportation and putting a fatal strain on border state resources.
There’s no denying the impact of this latest immigration wave or the need for more resources. But there’s no crisis. Local communities like mine have done an amazing job of..."

"After the president tweeted misleading information about mail-in ballots, Twitter applied a warning label to Trump’s tweets for the first time.
For the first time ever, Twitter has fact-checked President Trump’s tweets.
Until now, Twitter hasn’t taken any action against Trump’s account or tweets even when he has flouted the social media platform’s rules by posting false, harmful, or misleading content. Twitter’s rationale for letting Trump post these kinds of tweets has been that because he is a world leader, his posts are considered newsworthy and are therefore an exception..."
"The House will vote this week to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children and provide legal status to farm workers.
These will be the first immigration reform measures taken up by Congress this year. The votes could serve as the first barometer of the chances for comprehensive immigration reform in this session of Congress.
A bipartisan agreement has remained elusive to lawmakers and presidents of both parties after nearly a decade of half-starts and broken-down negotiations.
Complicating the debate this week is the migrant crisis unfolding..."
"Barbara Bush made national headlines last year when she said on NBC that her son Jeb shouldn't run for president in 2016 because ""there are a lot of great families. It's not just four families, or whatever. There are other people out there that are very qualified. We've had enough Bushes."" And in an interview earlier this year on C-SPAN, the former first lady added that ""I think this is"
"The swift fall of Afghanistan to Taliban fighters two decades after the United States invaded the country has triggered a political and humanitarian crisis. It’s also causing security experts to wonder: What’s going to happen to the country’s vast untapped mineral wealth?
Afghanistan is one of the poorest nations in the world. But in 2010, US military officials and geologists revealed that the country, which lies at the crossroads of Central and South Asia, was sitting on mineral deposits worth nearly $1 trillion that could dramatically transform its economic prospects.
Supplies of minerals such as iron, copper and..."
"Helicopters evacuating Americans from Kabul as the Taliban closed in was a scene likened to the 1975 fall of Saigon in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.
Afghanistan's U.S.-trained forces appeared to readily collapse in the face of a concerted push by Taliban forces. Names and places that became familiar to Americans during their country's long involvement there — including Kunduz and Kandahar — fell like dominoes in recent days as the Taliban swept toward the capital.
The Taliban have gained a reputation for brutality and enforcement of a harsh brand of..."
"Hillary Clinton responded to the tightening race with Bernie Sanders on Thursday by arguing early polls that showed her with a sizable lead were ""artificial.""
Clinton, in an appearance on ""The Tonight Show,"" agreed that she and Sanders are ""in a tight race,"" a fact that she finds ""pretty exciting.""
After noting she and Sanders are close, host Jimmy Fallon reminded Clinton that she once ""had a 20-point lead at one point.""
""That is really artificial, all of those early soundings and polls,"" Clinton said. ""Once you get into it,..."
"Conventional wisdom, 2007: Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination in a cakewalk. Conventional wisdom, 2015: Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination in a cakewalk.
Everybody knows what happened to the conventional wisdom once 2007 turned to 2008. Certainly Clinton does. This time around, even as she amassed advantages that may still prove insurmountable, her campaign put forth a strong message: ""We get it. We’ve changed.""
But after a promising start, Clinton's campaign has taken an abrupt, confused, strategic turn. And a familiar crassness has returned to a campaign..."
"After a day of embarrassing failures, House Republican leadership inched toward bringing a new emergency funding bill for the border crisis to the floor Friday.
The new legislation — described to GOP lawmakers in a closed-door meeting in the Capitol — uses revised language from Texas Rep. John Carter, Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt and Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston to change a 2008 trafficking law that made it harder to deport children from countries other than Canada and Mexico."
"House Republicans moved closer to consensus Friday on legislation that would do little to immediately solve the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border but would allow them to go home and tell voters that they did what they could before the start of a five-week recess.
GOP leaders cautioned that they still have not locked down the votes needed to pass border security legislation, which was dramatically pulled from the House floor Thursday because of a lack of support from conservatives."
"Investors look at a number of signals to forecast if the economy is headed for a recession. And those signals are now flashing bright red.
The clearest signal is coming from the stock market. The Dow dropped 1,800 points in early trading Monday — a 7% decline on top of the nearly 12% decline since it hit a record high on February 19. The latest slump put the Dow close to ""bear market"" territory, or when stocks sink at least 20% from their previous peak.
Just a few weeks..."
"Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, powered by a surge of support from evangelical Christians, handily defeated Donald J. Trump in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, throwing into question the depth of support for Mr. Trump’s unconventional candidacy. In the first contest of a campaign that has been more of a populist revolt against the political order than a traditional Republican primary, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida finished a strong third, bolstering his case to consolidate the support of Republicans uneasy about the two top finishers. With 85 percent of precincts..."
"President Biden is joining other world democratic leaders on the first day of the Group of 7 summit in Britain, hoping to restore U.S. relations with the world's democracies and urging them to unite to confront COVID-19 and other global challenges.
Leaders of the G7 and guest countries will provide more than 1 billion additional COVID-19 vaccine doses for the world, 500 million of which will come from the United States, the White House said Friday. The U.S. will lead the G7 and other countries in a global COVID-19 vaccination campaign...."
"Netflix has a storm on its hands.
Hundreds of protesters stood in solidarity with the streaming giant’s employees, who staged a walkout on Wednesday morning in the wake of Dave Chappelle’s inflammatory comedy special The Closer, which has been widely viewed as transphobic.
The walkout came after several days of backlash against Netflix, first for standing by the special, then for temporarily suspending three Netflix workers—one of whom is trans— for attending a high-level meeting about the special, and most recently for firing a Black trans employee who allegedly shared that Netflix had shelled out $24.1..."
"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is happening thousands of miles away from the closest major US city. And yet millions of American families will feel the economic consequences.
That's because the world economy and financial markets are interconnected. As Covid demonstrated, events on one side of the planet can set off shockwaves on the other side.
In this case, an invasion of Ukraine by Russia will likely drive up the already-high cost of living in the United States, rattle investment portfolios and perhaps even slow down the economic recovery."
"Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Latino chosen for President-elect Joe Biden's Cabinet, will head a Department of Homeland Security that is expected to drastically overhaul President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, as well as put Mayorkas at the forefront of the new administration’s anti-terrorism strategy.
Mayorkas will be the first Latino and first immigrant to head the Department of Homeland Security, if confirmed by the Senate. The highest-ranking Cuban American in the Obama administration, Mayorkas was deputy secretary of DHS under then-Secretary Jeh Johnson, and before that was the director of..."
"President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Alejandro Mayorkas to head the Department of Homeland Security, tapping the Cuban American to reverse President Trump's hard-line immigration policies.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas would be the first Latino and the first immigrant to become secretary of Homeland Security. The Biden transition team announced his nomination today. He'd be taking on a big job, leading a sprawling department that's charged with protecting the president, airport screening and cybersecurity. But the biggest change is likely to be how the department handles immigration and..."
"Election Day is here at last. America is set to decide between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
But the long, unusual and often ugly 2016 presidential campaign has been about the country’s changing demographics and the shifting coalitions of the two major parties as much as about the two main candidates."
"Looking to head off deep, automatic spending cuts set to kick in on March 1, President Obama on Tuesday afternoon said that to avoid the negative economic effects that come with ""political disfunction,"" Congress should move quickly to pass ""a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms"" that won't hurt the economy."
"President Joe Biden’s decision this week to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan before September 11 has left policymakers, military leaders and national security professionals wondering what happens next.
Critics haven’t been shy about pointing out that a U.S. withdrawal will leave the Taliban in a powerful position, and could even give Al Qaeda room to grow again. To keep the country from once again becoming a haven for terrorist operations, Biden will need to shift quickly from a “boots on the ground” strategy to something more remote: an offshore counterterror..."
"I have tried, for the duration of this election, to stay informed, without being obsessive. It hasn’t been easy. The media has been frenzied, at best, particularly as they cover Donald J. Trump. Early on, cable news networks aired entire Trump events before he was even his party’s nominee. They created an unhealthy demand for “news” that they were more than happy to supply. There is no escape."
"Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in the US Senate on Friday took the atypical rebellious step of overriding his veto for the first time in his presidency.
The Senate pushed through a bill on defense spending against Trump’s strong objections – just 20 days before he leaves office.
Meeting in a rare New Year’s Day session, the Senate secured the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto with bipartisan support two days before a new Congress will be sworn in on Sunday.
Eight previous vetoes of legislation have been upheld. Under..."
"Donald Trump is tearing the Grand Old Party apart. The tension that has simmered in the Republican Party for years -- shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default -- escalated into an outright civil war Tuesday. The conflict not only threatens the party's ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the White House next month, but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the GOP for years to come if Trump loses."
"Rapidly rising prices have caused economic hardship for millions of Americans. But drastic action to rein in prices could lead to even more pain, including job losses.
Overall prices jumped 7.5% during the last year, according to the January consumer price index reading, the fastest pace in nearly 40 years. The increases have squeezed household budgets for consumers, caused political problems for Joe Biden and resulted in calls for the Federal Reserve to take relatively severe action, such as its first half-percentage-point hike since 2000.
But some economists are cautioning that would be a very bad idea,..."
"The power supply was cut to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said, blaming Russia's invading forces for the blackout and warning that it could lead to ""nuclear discharge."" 
The U.N.-backed global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, downplayed concerns of an imminent radioactive release, but a Ukrainian national emergency services agency said if power to the plant's cooling systems, which prevent spent nuclear fuel from evaporating, is not ensured, it could leave winds to blow a ""radioactive cloud to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe.""
The Chernobyl power plant,..."
"Rand Paul's foreign policy grew up. In a major speech in New York last week, Paul laid out a case for conservative realism. ""We need a foreign policy that recognizes our limits and preserves our might, a common-sense conservative realism of strength and action. We can't retreat from the world, but we can't remake it in our own image either,"" he said.
Zack Beauchamp at Vox called it one of the most important foreign policy speeches in decades, saying that if Paul runs in 2016 ""he isn't going to move..."
"Sen. Rand Paul just gave one of the most important speeches on foreign policy since George W. Bush declared war on Iraq. But instead of declaring war on another country, Paul declared war on his own party. Or, at least, its entire approach to foreign policy.
In his address last night at the Center for the National Interest — a think tank founded by Richard Nixon — Paul gave, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of how he thinks about foreign policy. His moderate non-interventionism is a far cry..."
"Responding to an outcry from medical experts, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Tuesday apologized for overstating the life-saving benefits of treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma.
Scientists and medical experts have been pushing back against the claims about the treatment since President Donald Trump’s announcement on Sunday that the FDA had decided to issue emergency authorization for convalescent plasma, taken from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus and rich in disease-fighting antibodies.
Trump hailed the decision as a historic breakthrough even though the treatment’s value has..."
"Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), apologized Monday for overstating the benefits of convalescent plasma as a coronavirus treatment during a press conference with President Donald Trump one day earlier.
""I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified,"" Hahn said in a thread of tweets posted in the middle of the first night of the Republican National Convention. ""What I should have said better is that the data show [sic] a relative..."
"Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a close friend of former President Donald J. Trump and one of his top 2016 campaign fund-raisers, was arrested in California on Tuesday morning on federal charges of failing to register as a foreign lobbyist, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators.
A seven-count indictment accused Mr. Barrack, 74, of using his access to Mr. Trump to advance the foreign policy goals of the United Arab Emirates and then lying about his activities during a June 2019 interview with federal agents.
Federal prosecutors said that Mr...."
"The only thing tragic about the death of Donald Rumsfeld is that it didn’t occur in an Iraqi prison. Yet that was foreordained, considering how throughout his life inside the precincts of American national security, Rumsfeld escaped the consequences of decisions he made that ensured a violent, frightening end for hundreds of thousands of people.
An actuarial table of the deaths for which Donald Rumsfeld is responsible is difficult to assemble. In part, that’s a consequence of his policy, as defense secretary from 2001 to 2006, not to compile or release body counts,..."
"The death of Donald Rumsfeld – Republican powerbroker, controversial Defense Secretary and architect of the Iraq war – days before his 89th birthday from multiple myeloma has drawn reaction from lawmakers, presidents and more.
Here is a look at how he is being remembered:
In a statement Wednesday, former President George W. Bush lauded Rumsfeld, who served as Bush's defense secretary, as a ""faithful steward of our armed forces.""
""A period that brought unprecedented challenges to our country and to our military also brought out the best qualities in Secretary Rumsfeld,"" the statement reads. ""A..."
"The two most contentious items have been left out of the agreement.
Congressional negotiators are on the brink of a coronavirus rescue package that would include a second round of direct payments, but would likely leave out state and local funding and a liability shield, according to multiple sources involved with and briefed on talks.
The price tag of the emerging deal is nearly $900 billion, and a deal could be finalized as early as this morning, those sources said.
The direct checks will likely be far less than $1,200..."
"Obama opened a White House news conference reiterating his call for Congress to immediately pass an extension of the Bush- era tax cuts for the first $200,000 of annual income for individuals and $250,000 for married couples. He said the rates on earnings above those levels should be allowed to rise when they expire at the end of the year."
"Amid the rush to assign blame for the widespread violence and vandalism breaking out in American cities, accusations that extremists or other outside agitators were behind the destruction continued to ricochet online and on the airwaves on Sunday.
Numerous political leaders, starting with President Trump, have leveled accusations at various groups, asserting that some radical agenda is at play in transforming once peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
“We have reason to believe that bad actors continue to infiltrate the rightful protests of George..."
"The United States has reported at least 400,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University as of Tuesday afternoon.
That's more than the number of Americans who died in World War I, Vietnam War and the Korean War combined, and nearly as many Americans who died in World War II. It's far higher than any other country's Covid-19 death toll.
The pandemic's death toll has risen sharply in increments of 100,000 since the first coronavirus death in the United States..."
"President Joe Biden on Tuesday welcomed Russian overtures toward ending a crisis in Ukraine, but reiterated that he was ready to respond with overwhelming economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.
“We should give diplomacy every chance to succeed,” Biden said in brief remarks from the East Room of the White House. “We will not sacrifice basic principles, though.”
Those principles, he said, include Ukraine’s sovereignty and its right to territorial integrity.
“The United States is prepared no matter what happens,” he said, noting that “an invasion remains distinctly possible.”"
"China’s economy shrank 6.8% in the three months of 2020, the country’s first such contraction on record and a stark sign of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The news came as Chinese authorities revised the death toll in Wuhan, the hardest hit city and where the virus first emerged, up by 50%, to 3,869 from 2,579.
Citing the number of patients who had died at home before reaching hospital, as well as late and inaccurate reporting, the city’s task force on virus prevention and control said: “Every loss..."
"House Democrats are giving the Trump administration a hard deadline of April 23 to turn over the president’s tax returns, pushing back against Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s skepticism over their request for the private records.
Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, on Saturday sent a two-page letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig rebuffing Mnuchin’s statement earlier this week that Treasury would miss House Democrats’ initial April 10 deadline for the returns."
"Just one in four Americans are following the debate over the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts set to kick in on Friday very closely, according to a new Washington Post-Pew poll, numbers that serve as a reminder that although talk of the sequester is dominating the nations capitol, it has yet to permeate into the public at large."
"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday that the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia over its war with Ukraine are ""draining"" the Russian economy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin's ""war machine.""
""Ukraine must win this war,"" von der Leyen said during an address at the World Economic Forum's annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland. 
""And Putin's aggression must be a strategic failure,"" she added. ""We will do everything we can to help Ukrainians prevail and retake the future into their hands.""
Von der Leyen noted that the sweeping economic sanctions against Russia by..."
"President Trump met Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on Monday, beginning three days of royal feting and carefully calibrated diplomacy.
But first, he called the London mayor a “stone cold loser” — and short. And Trump complained at length on Twitter about CNN news coverage of his trip.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump were greeted at Stansted Airport by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt — but not by Prime Minister Theresa May, who is being ousted over Brexit. Trump’s official state visit coincides with a furious..."
"On May 22, in a cringe-worthy exchange with Charlamagne tha God on the popular radio show “The Breakfast Club,” Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said, “If you have a problem figuring out whether you are for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
Advisers from the Biden campaign attempted to walk back the comment, suggesting it was made in jest. Biden apologized.
Biden’s comments reflect a common misunderstanding within both political parties about the role that white Americans play in maintaining black support for the Democratic Party. In the book..."
"A pledge on Wednesday from President Xi Jinping of China to help fight climate change is expected to send a strong signal, since meeting global emissions-reduction goals will require sustained efforts from Beijing in curbing the country’s addiction to coal and greatly bolstering sources of renewable energy, analysts and policy advisers say."
"The Trump administration will reject new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as it seeks new avenues to dismantle parts of the program, the administration announced Tuesday.
The administration will also shorten the window for current DACA recipients, or so-called Dreamers, to renew their status from two years to one year, according to a Tuesday memo from the Department of Homeland Security. The new policy for renewals grants the administration a chance to conduct a “comprehensive review” of the program to assess its legality after a Supreme..."
"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's administration will continue to reject new applications for an immigration program that allows young, undocumented immigrants to live and work in the country but will let current ""Dreamers"" renew those protections.
The decision, announced in a Department of Homeland Security memo, comes a month after a divided Supreme Court blocked the White House from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, finding the administration was ""arbitrary and capricious"" in how it sought to wind down the Obama-era program.
Trump has long sought to..."
"A former U.S. senatorial candidate says the virtual Democratic National Convention left the word God out of the nation’s most famous and solemn oath.
""The DNC omitted ‘one nation under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance,"" said Peggy Hubbard, who lost Illinois’ Republican primary election in March, in an Aug. 20 Facebook post."
"A rumor circulated on social media during the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in August 2020 alleging that the DNC had omitted the phrase “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance. This statement is misleading at best. The DNC did not omit “under God” from the pledge, nor did they forbid its use. In fact, during every recitation of the pledge before each night’s events — the 2020 DNC lasted four nights — the phrase “under God” was included.
Here, for example, is a video of Cedric Richmond Jr., the..."
"President Obama said world leaders were right to be ""rattled"" by Donald Trump.
“They are rattled by (him) — and for good reason,” said Obama of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The president was speaking Thursday in Japan on the sidelines of a Group of Seven conference, a two-day event focused on the global economy."
"Kanye West is acquiring Parler, the alternative social media platform favored by many conservatives.
Parler’s parent company announced the deal on Monday morning, saying West had made “a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space and will never have to fear being removed from social media again.”
The acquisition comes after West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, was temporarily locked by Twitter this month over an antisemitic tweet.
Exact terms of the Parler deal weren’t disclosed, though Parler said it must still enter into a definitive agreement with..."
"The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas to obtain the full report of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, escalating a feud with the Justice Department over a lengthy document detailing findings about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on Monday announced plans for the panel’s vote, which would take place a day after a deadline the committee set for Attorney General William P. Barr to share the report.
Barr pledged last week to..."
"With Ukraine under growing threat from Russia, the United States and its NATO allies across Europe are stepping up their response.
But there is one notable country that appears to be holding back: Germany.
As Russian troops have massed on the Ukrainian border, Berlin has resisted pressure from its allies and neighbors to deliver arms to Ukraine while urging “prudence” when it comes to potential economic sanctions against Moscow.
The reluctance of Europe’s leading economic power to join the more robust Western posture has drawn criticism from Kyiv and threatened to undermine the effort to present..."
"Here is one thing we are reminded of over and over about President Trump: The man simply cannot help himself — especially when cornered. Given one more chance to forcefully condemn the neo-Nazis and white supremacists whose rally in Charlottesville, Va., ended in violence and a counterprotester’s death, Mr. Trump angrily insisted, as he had suggested on Saturday, that both sides were equally to blame — a false equivalency that not just his critics but also an increasing number of his supporters have urged him to abandon."
"EVER SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY to lead the Democratic National Committee, Keith Ellison, the first American Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, has been the target of a defamation campaign that is deceitful, repugnant, and yet quite predictable. At first expressed in whispers, but now being yelled from the rooftops by some of the party’s most influential figures, Ellison is being smeared as both an anti-Semite and enemy of Israel – the same smears virtually any critic of the Israeli government reflexively encounters, rendered far worse if the critic..."
"A Texas sheriff said Monday evening his agency will open an investigation into the transportation of 48 Venezuelan migrants from the state to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, a Democrat, told reporters at a Monday news conference that his understanding was that on Wednesday a Venezuelan migrant was paid a ""bird dog fee"" to recruit 50 migrants from a resource center in San Antonio.
The sheriff said he believes laws were not only broken in Bexar County in transporting nearly 50 migrants to Martha's Vineyard but that parallel..."
"Thousands of emergency workers in California struggled to fight a rapidly growing wildfire near Yosemite National Park on Sunday as President Joe Biden continued to mull whether to declare a national climate emergency, a move that campaigners say is needed to respond to the immediate threat of extreme weather and lay the groundwork for a livable future.
Dubbed the Oak Fire, the California blaze was completely uncontained as of Sunday afternoon, having tripled in size since it began on Friday. The fire has now burned more than 14,000 acres, making it..."
"The first night of the first debate of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary is over, with the first 10 candidates jousting Wednesday night in Miami.
Below are our winners and losers.
Winners
Elizabeth Warren: The Massachusetts senator went into the debate with the biggest target on her back as the highest-polling candidate onstage. But she largely skated. Other candidates didn’t seem to have the appetite to put her on the spot. After the first question, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) all..."
"Bob Dole, a longtime Senate Republican leader and the party's presidential nominee in 1996, died Sunday at age 98.
Dole's death was confirmed in a tweet by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.
""It is with heavy hearts we announce that Senator Robert Joseph Dole died early this morning in his sleep. At his death, at age 98, he had served the United States of America faithfully for 79 years.""
Dole was in many ways the embodiment of the World War II generation in Congress. He had served in a combat division in Italy and..."
"Bob Dole, the World War II veteran who recovered from near-fatal wounds to become the U.S. Senate Republican leader and a three-time presidential candidate, has died. He was 98.
Dole died Sunday morning in his sleep, according to a Twitter post by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. He disclosed in February that he had stage-four lung cancer.
Dole’s loss to Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election ended a political career that spanned more than four decades and took him from the legislature in Kansas to the innermost circles of power in..."
"President Barack Obama's round of golf with Tiger Woods was one of the most talked about moments of the weekend, but not one of the most seen. Despite its high interest and high profile, the game was off-limits to White House reporters and photographers.
And that drew a complaint from the White House Correspondents’ Association, expressing news organizations' ""extreme frustration"" with the lack of access, and promising a continuing fight for more transparency.
It all started as the president enjoyed the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend with friends at a private..."
"President Barack Obama is hitting the links Sunday in Palm City, Fla., with professional golfer Tiger Woods one day after playing with his former coach, according to Tim Rosaforte of Golf Digest.
Rosaforte wrote on Twitter that Obama and Woods, who has more tournament winnings than any golfer in the sport's history, were playing their first round together. Also playing: Jim Crane, the owner of the Florida resort where Obama is spending the weekend.
Obama golfed Saturday with Woods's former coach, Butch Harmon, along with Crane, who also..."
"Former President Donald Trump and a right-wing lawyer were part of a ""criminal conspiracy"" to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot alleges in a court filing Wednesday.
The filing is part of an attempt to convince a judge to allow the panel access to emails from lawyer John Eastman, who is claiming attorney-client privilege. The committee said he helped to orchestrate the plot.
The filing is the most extensive release to date from the House's January 6 investigators as they try to obtain Eastman's emails..."
"As Russian missiles struck a key Ukrainian city, Russian President Vladimir Putin expanded a fast-track procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship to all Ukrainians on Monday, another effort to strengthen Moscow’s influence over war-torn Ukraine.
Until recently, only residents of Ukraine’s separatist eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as residents of the southern Zaporizhzhia and the Kherson regions, large parts of which are now under Russian control, were eligible to apply for the simplified passport procedure.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Klueba said Putin’s signing of a passport decree, which also..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree expanding a fast track to Russian citizenship to all citizens of Ukraine, a document published on the government’s website showed.
Until recently, only residents of the self-proclaimed breakaway territories of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) in eastern Ukraine, which Russia seeks to “liberate” from Kyiv’s control, as well as the Russian-occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhia, were eligible for the simplified procedure.
Between 2019 – when the procedure was first introduced for the residents of Donetsk and Luhansk..."
"Senate Republicans are likely to include a provision to provide billions of dollars for child care providers in the GOP’s narrow coronavirus relief bill, according to GOP sources.
The child care component of the bill is expected to resemble the language in the Senate Republicans’ $1 trillion coronavirus relief bill, unveiled in late July. That provision allocated $15 billion for child care providers, including grants to help child care centers reopen and follow health and safety guidelines."
"On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined—that is, blocked—Trump’s attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance—or the merits—of the challenge to Trump’s plan to terminate DACA.
The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA’s backers are likely to prevail. The bad news is that the injunction isn’t complete."
"Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. is resigning, the Justice Department said Thursday, but plans to remain in office until a successor is confirmed.
Mr. Holder, the 82nd attorney general and the first African-American to serve in that position, had previously said he planned to leave office by the end of this year.
Particularly in President Obama’s second term, Mr. Holder has been the most prominent liberal voice of the administration, leading its push for same-sex marriage and voting rights."
"Secretary of State John Kerry will deliver a major speech on the Iran nuclear deal at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday, CNN has learned. Kerry will use the speech to defend the merits of the agreement and respond to its critics.
During an interview with CNN in Anchorage ahead of a conference of Arctic nations, the secretary pushed back on the notion that the Iranians would be able to self-inspect at Parchin, as Republicans in Congress have alleged.
""We are satisfied"
"U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, said on Sunday he would support the nuclear deal with Iran, moving President Barack Obama a step closer to having sufficient backing to ensure the deal stands.
""I believe the agreement, titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,"" Merkley wrote in a statement published on Medium.com.
Obama is trying to muster 34 votes in the Senate to ensure lawmakers cannot kill the deal. Thirty-one senators, all Democrats and..."
"The surging number of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has posed a ""stressful challenge"" for the Biden administration, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas acknowledged Monday, while insisting that the influx of undocumented children has not reached a ""crisis"" level.
""Quite frankly, we are working as hard as we are, not only in addressing the urgency of the challenge, but also in building the capacity to manage it,"" the newly confirmed secretary said in his debut appearance at the White House press briefing.
U.S. officials along the southern border..."
"Senators are girding for a spirited debate Tuesday over the rules that will guide the impeachment trial of President Trump — just the third in history of a U.S. president — focused on his conduct toward Ukraine.
When it reconvenes, the chamber will take up a resolution proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that seeks a swift trial. Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), have panned the proposal, arguing it is part of an effort to “cover up” Trump’s dealings. On Tuesday, the House impeachment..."
"Negative perceptions of the Republican party are on the rise...among Republicans. Donald Trump may be leading in national polls, but Walker and Rubio are perceived as the most acceptable and viable candidates by activist Republicans. And a low response rate doesn't automatically mean a survey is wrong. This is HuffPollster for Friday, July 24, 2015.
REPUBLICAN PARTY IMAGE TAKES A DIP - Pew Research: ""The Republican Party’s image has grown more negative over the first half of this year. Currently, 32% have a favorable impression of the Republican Party, while..."
"Republicans dreaming of shooing away Donald Trump may want to think twice.
By publicly rebuking the billionaire businessman for his inflammatory comments, the party may convince Trump to launch a third-party candidacy.
That's a potential nightmare scenario for the GOP establishment: a populist outsider with unlimited resources attacking their nominee from the right in the general election, raising hell -- and attracting votes -- with his rhetoric on issues like illegal immigration.
Ralph Nader, who has run for president multiple times as a third-party candidate and may have cost Democrat..."
"Joe Biden will withdraw all the remaining US troops from Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, a senior administration official has confirmed.
The president is expected to make a formal announcement on Wednesday. There are currently about 2,500 US troops in the country, serving alongside 7,000 other foreign troops as part of a Nato coalition. Most, if not all, Nato allies are likely to withdraw in coordination with the US.
“We will remain in lockstep with them as we..."
"Nearing decision time, senators were struggling to wrap up work on the bipartisan infrastructure plan despite hopes to expedite consideration and voting on the nearly $1 trillion proposal.
The package had appeared on track for eventual Senate passage, a rare accord between Republicans and Democrats joining on a shared priority that also is essential to President Joe Biden’s agenda. But senators hit new problems late Thursday as they worked late into the night on amendments. A procedural vote was set for Saturday.
“We’ve worked long, hard and collaboratively, to finish this important..."
"Ã¢â‚¬â€ More Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, though the winter holidays likely distorted the data for the second straight week.
The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications rose by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 372,000 in the week ended Dec. 29. The previous weeks total was revised higher"
"Jobless Claims Went Up; So Two Out Of Three Reports Were Positive:
There were 372,000 first-time claims for unemployment insurance last week, up by 10,000 from the week before, the Employment and Training Administration says. What's more, that previous week's total was revised up from the previous estimate of 350,000."
"Remember the promise of normalcy by July Fourth? How can it be that now — after Thanksgiving, after so much sacrifice and waiting, after the arrival of vaccines, after months of sweaty masks, distancing and isolation — that another wave of pandemic infection is upon us? In Europe, lockdowns are returning. In some hot spots such as Minnesota and Michigan, hospital wards are again overflowing. A worrying new variant is raising alarms. What happened?
It’s not all bad. The vaccination campaign has put at least one dose in the arms of more than..."
"A lawyer for former national security adviser Michael Flynn informed an attorney for President Trump this week that he can no longer discuss the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, a sign that Flynn may be preparing to cooperate in the probe, people familiar with the investigation said."
"WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee turned its focus Wednesday to former President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence into refusing to certify the 2020 election results.
As its third public hearing opened, the bipartisan panel began to argue that effort was the central component of an illegal conspiracy to keep Trump in power — one that put the republic, and Pence, in mortal danger.
Presiding over the certification of the electoral vote is one of the few official duties of the vice president, but Trump had embraced a fringe theory that..."
"The U.S. Federal Reserve has been the most aggressive in using interest rate hikes to cool inflation that is battering both households and businesses this year. This week, central banks from Asia to England followed suit to varying degrees and using different economic tools to tame rising prices that are not isolated to the U.S.
Following are actions taken Thursday, and also earlier this week, by central banks globally:
Turkey: The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey lowered the benchmark rate by 1 percentage point, to 12%. The lira was trading around 18.38..."
"Hours after reports emerged that Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) was expected to plead guilty to insider trading charges, the Daily Beast broke the news that Collins had resigned his seat on Monday. Several other outlets, including the Washington Post, confirmed that the four-term congressman had stepped down.
Collins’ departure from the House marks an inglorious end to his congressional tenure after three-and-a-half-terms representing a deep-red district in upstate New York. As one of the safest incumbents in the country, Collins drew notoriety in 2016 when he became one of..."
"One of the four women who say they were “groomed” for sex by Ghislaine Maxwell testified Wednesday that the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein took her to meet Donald Trump when she was just 14.
Testifying at Maxwell’s trial in New York City, the woman, who is being identified by the pseudonym Jane, said on cross-examination that she met the future president in the 1990s at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
Jane didn’t allege any improper behavior by Trump and didn’t go into further detail about why she was at the resort.

"Senate Democrats are growing impatient for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, as the impasse continues over sending the articles of impeachment from the Democratic House to the Republican-led Senate.
""We're ready, willing and able,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former state attorney general. ""I'm ready to go to court and try this case.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has delayed sending the two articles, which accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction Congress, until she learns more about how the Senate trial will be conducted.
A..."
"House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.), a top lieutenant of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Thursday that she should go ahead and transmit the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate and allow a trial to begin.
Smith’s high-profile break with Pelosi came shortly before she deflected when asked by a reporter about her impasse with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Pelosi said she knows when she’ll send the articles to the Senate, adding, “I won’t be telling you right now.” Pelosi has said she first..."
"The Justice Department's internal watchdog has concluded that James Comey defied authority at times during his tenure as FBI director, according to sources familiar with a draft report on the matter.
One source told ABC News that the draft report explicitly used the word ""insubordinate"" to describe Comey's behavior. Another source agreed with that characterization but could not confirm the use of the term.
In the draft report, Inspector General Michael Horowitz also rebuked former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for her handling of the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's personal..."
"The Department of Justice's inspector general has concluded that James Comey defied authority at times during his time leading of the FBI, ABC News reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with a draft report on the matter.
The report, when finished and officially released, will cap Inspector General Michael Horowitz's inquiry into the FBI's handling of its investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The report is said to focus on senior FBI leadership at the time, like Comey and Attorney General..."
"Just a few years ago, the tax deal pushed through Congress on Tuesday would have been a Republican fiscal fantasy, a sweeping bill that locks in virtually all of the Bush-era tax cuts, exempts almost all estates from taxation, and enshrines the former presidents credo that dividends and capital gains should be taxed equally and gently."
"After exhaustive negotiations that strained the country's patience, the House approved a bill to avert the dreaded fiscal cliff, staving off widespread tax increases and deep spending cuts.
In the 257-167 vote late Tuesday, 172 Democrats and 85 Republicans favored the bill; 16 Democrats and 151 Republicans opposed it."
"One of the convicted killers who escaped from a maximum-security prison in upstate New York earlier this month was shot and killed by federal law enforcement officers Friday afternoon near a cabin a few miles south of the Canadian border, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced at an evening news conference."
"President Donald Trump appealed to Black Americans to help re-elect him, telling them in a speech Friday that Democrats -- whom African Americans are poised to overwhelmingly support in November -- take their votes for granted.
“They want to take the Black voter for granted and they have taken the Black voter for granted,” Trump said in a speech in Atlanta on Friday where he announced a plan to promote economic policies to benefit Black Americans.
“I did more for the Black community in 47 months than Joe Biden did..."
"Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has faced a barrage of lawsuits from top Democrats and liberal advocacy groups challenging his broad assertions of executive power, usually over contentious issues like his crackdown on sanctuary cities or his refusal to cooperate with congressional investigations.
Now, however, the president faces a battle over a set of executive actions he issued on Saturday providing economic relief measures that many of his fiercest critics actually support, including weekly federal unemployment payments, student loan relief and efforts to protect tenants from eviction during the pandemic...."
"WASHINGTON – With stimulus talks with Congress at an impasse, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on Saturday to provide temporary relief to Americans who are suffering from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
At a news conference from his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., Trump signed four orders that will provide an additional $400 per week in unemployment benefits, suspend payments on some student loans through the end of the year, protect renters from being evicted from their homes, and instruct employers to defer certain..."
"President Obama will begin talks with congressional leaders Friday with a plan to raise $1.6 trillion in new tax revenue from the wealthy Ã¢â‚¬â€ making clear that, at least the outset, a wide gulf remains between congressional Republicans and the White House on the most contentious point in the negotiations.
While Obama said last week he is not wedded to every detail of his previous proposals, the White"
"President Obama meets with labor leaders at the White House on Tuesday to discuss how to steer clear of the so-called fiscal cliff. It's the first of many meetings aimed at avoiding automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the beginning of the new year.
A week ago, the president proved again that he and his team are good at winning elections. The question now is whether he can translate victory at the ballot box to success in shaping policy.

"Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris told supporters on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
“I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,” she wrote in a note to supporters. “My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.”
Harris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people at a chilly, outdoor campaign launch in January. The first woman and..."
"AT this stage in a presidential campaign, Republicans, generally a rather disciplined lot, have usually united and begun to train their fire on Democrats. Circular firing squads are for them, not us.
Not this year.
The candidacy of Donald J. Trump is not only fracturing the Republican Party, it is breaking up friendships as well.
A prominent Republican, describing a Trump-related disagreement with another influential Republican with whom he has been close for decades, sent me a note that stated things in a matter-of-fact way: “We had a friendship-ending email..."
"Why Bernie-Hillary has gotten so personal. A couple months ago, one of my husband’s former colleagues from a progressive digital strategy firm popped up on his Facebook page to castigate him for supporting Hillary Clinton. “Matt, do you remember the exact date when you gave up?” the man wrote. “Was it when Obama turned out to be a damn conservative? Or were you never 100% behind this progressive thing to begin with? Tired of losing, so pick a candidate who, if she loses, it won’t really matter that much? I..."
"We progressives believe in diversity, and we want women, blacks, Latinos, gays and Muslims at the table — er, so long as they aren’t conservatives.
Universities are the bedrock of progressive values, but the one kind of diversity that universities disregard is ideological and religious. We’re fine with people who don’t look like us, as long as they think like us.
O.K., that’s a little harsh. But consider George Yancey, a sociologist who is black and evangelical.
“Outside of academia I faced more problems as a black,” he told me...."
"The idea of a universal basic income — a regular stipend paid to every American adult to meet minimum life needs — has been bubbling around the edges of American politics for decades.
With the coming of the coronavirus pandemic, UBI may finally move to center stage, and stay there.
“This is a moment when the UBI idea is possibly going to feel more appealing to a lot of people,” observes Ioana Marinescu, a labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied what she calls unconditional cash transfer..."
"President Trump was downright low energy.
The look on his face, as he meandered through unscripted remarks Friday after the defeat of the Republican health care plan he supported, told the story. The unusually subdued Trump called the loss a ""learning experience."" Then he seemed to shrug it all off and said he was moving on."
"The demise of the American Health Care Act last week through the ballet of incompetence by President Trump and the Republican Party could teach Latinos some valuable lessons: The GOP is an amateur national party when it comes to governing, and it's important to note that Americans will empathize with the face of poverty when that face is white."
"Real estate mogul and billionaire Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he is forming a presidential exploratory committee.
The announcement comes weeks after Trump hired political operatives in key early primary states and marks the most concrete step yet that Trump in seriously considering a presidential run, something he's hinted at doing for years.
Trump has repeatedly flirted with the idea of running for president, most recently in the leadup to the 2012 election when he said he was seriously considering jumping into the Republican fray. This is the first time..."
"Real estate mogul and TV personality Donald Trump took the first steps on Wednesday toward launching a 2016 presidential campaign, a sign the businessman may jump into the Republican race after publicly considering it in years past.
Trump said he had formed an exploratory committee to determine whether to run, and that he had hired staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Those states are among the first to hold Republican and Democratic presidential nominating contests.
""We have lost the respect of the entire world,"" Trump said in a..."
"President Trump has returned to the White House on Monday, on his fourth day at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, though his doctor said he might not be ""out of the woods"" yet.
The president walked from Marine One into the White House residence, and up to the balcony, where he removed his mask.
The president announced his expected departure from the military hospital earlier with a tweet. ""Don't be afraid of COVID,"" he wrote. ""Don't let it dominate your life."""
"President Trump held his first public event since contracting the novel coronavirus, gathering a crowd of hundreds of supporters at the White House on Saturday despite providing no evidence that he was no longer infectious.
It marked the beginning of what aides have described as a triumphant return to campaigning for reelection after his hospitalization — and a sign that the virus that rocked Trump’s campaign and infected much of the West Wing has not changed his combative and defiant approach to governing."
"In an unsigned editorial Tuesday morning, The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote this about the planned Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on sexual assault allegations made by California professor Christine Blasey Ford against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh:
""This is simply too distant and uncorroborated a story to warrant a new hearing or to delay a vote. We've heard from all three principals, and there are no other witnesses to call. Democrats will use Monday's hearing as a political spectacle to coax Mr. Kavanaugh into looking defensive or angry, and..."
"President Joe Biden's plan to forgive $10,000 in federal student debt for most borrowers will cost the government about $400 billion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in an estimate released Monday.
The CBO’s evaluation of the administration's policy said the price tag is ""a result of the action canceling up to $10,000 of debt issued on or before June 30, 2022.""
The president's plan covers borrowers with income below specified limits and an additional $10,000 forgiven for those who also received at least one Pell grant, CBO Director Phillip Swagel said."
"About 188,000 residents near Oroville, Calif., were ordered to evacuate Sunday after a hole in an emergency spillway in the Oroville Dam threatened to flood the surrounding area. Thousands clogged highways leading out of the area headed south, north and west, and arteries major and minor remained jammed as midnight approached on the West Coast."
"The area around a huge dam at California's second-largest reservoir is in a state of emergency, with some 180,000 residents ordered to evacuate the area Sunday out of fears that part of Oroville Dam could fail. A glimmer of hope arrived late Sunday night, when officials said water had finally stopped pouring over the dam's emergency spillway."
"President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that his administration will have a coronavirus vaccine ready for Americans before the year ends. The lofty promise came during his acceptance speech on the final night of the Republican National Convention.
""In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy,"" Trump said to a largely mask-less crowd of 1,500 supporters gathered on the White House lawn. ""We are delivering lifesaving therapies. And we'll produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or..."
"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack has held what is expected to be its final public hearing, driving home a conclusion that once would have been unthinkable, but now is inescapable: The president of the United States was directly responsible for an assault on the nation’s government.
Donald Trump dodged accountability for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol when Senate Republicans acquitted him the following month in his second impeachment trial. Prosecuting the former president raises complex questions of law — and about whether doing so would ultimately set..."
"The Department of Justice will mobilize the FBI in response to a spike in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school board members across the country.
In a memorandum released Monday evening, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices to meet in the next 30 days with federal, state and local law enforcement leaders to outline strategies for addressing the incidents, which have become more frequent and more volatile in recent months.
""Threats against public servants are not only illegal, they run counter to our..."
"United States commandos stormed a village in southern Yemen early Saturday in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda, but the raid ended in tragedy, with the kidnappers killing the American and a South African held with him, United States officials said.
The hostages — Luke Somers, an American photojournalist, and Pierre Korkie, a South African teacher — were killed by their captors, militants from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, when they"
"American photojournalist Luke Somers was killed during a failed rescue attempt in Yemen, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Saturday.
Somers had been held by al-Qaeda militants since his abduction in Yemen's capital of Sanaa in September 2013.
Hagel, speaking from Kabul where he made a surprise visit Saturday, confirmed the British-born hostage's death following an unsuccessful raid to free him by U.S. and Yemeni special forces."
"The president will issue an executive order Monday in the name of easing student borrowers’ debt loads by capping repayments at 10 percent of their monthly income, the New York Times reports.
President Barack Obama said in his weekly address Saturday that he would take action on student loan issues in the coming days, but gave no details. A White House official told the times that Obama will expand on a 2010 law that capped borrowers’ repayment but left a hole in eligibility for people with older loans. Those..."
"President Obama on Monday will take executive actions to ease the burden of college loan debt for potentially millions of Americans, in a White House event coinciding with Senate Democrats’ plans for legislation to address a concern of many voters in this midterm election year.
Before an East Room audience, Mr. Obama is scheduled to announce “new steps to further lift the burden of crushing student loan debt,” said a White House official, who declined to be identified describing the actions in advance of the president’s event."
"Hiring cooled in May, the Labor Department reported Friday, as firms appeared more hesitant to bring on new employees amid the uncertainty and concern over President Trump escalating the trade war with China.
The U.S. economy added 75,000 jobs in May, a significant pullback from 224,000 jobs added in April that is likely to heighten fears that the trade war is taking a greater toll. The unemployment rate remained at a five decade low of 3.6 percent.
Manufacturing and construction saw anemic job growth in May with less than 5,000..."
"Donald Trump pumped up his attacks on Hillary Clinton's character Saturday night by suggesting that the former secretary of state is not mentally fit to be president.
""She took a short-circuit in the brain. She's got problems,"" Trump said, seizing on Clinton's explanation that she ""short-circuited"" a recent answer about her truthfulness in discussing her email server."
"Parts of the federal government are set to remain closed through much of next week as Congress shuttered Saturday for Christmas amid a stalemate with President Trump over border wall funding.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced that his chamber would not return to legislative business until Thursday, which means many federal agencies will remain closed until later next week at the earliest and hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be left in limbo about their status.
“Listen, anything can happen,” McConnell said. “We’re pulling for an agreement..."
"A top aide to Mike Pence defended the vice president's decision to stay at a Trump hotel during his trip to Ireland.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Two, chief of staff Marc Short said the idea to stay at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland, was a ""suggestion"" from President Donald Trump.
""It's like when we went through the trip, it's like, well, he's going to Doonbeg because that's where the Pence family is from,"" Short explained. ""It's like, 'Well, you should stay..."
"When Vice President Mike Pence woke up Tuesday in the west of Ireland, he had a long commute ahead of him: the span of the entire island to Dublin, where he was meeting with government officials.
The reason for the journey: Pence was staying at the golf property owned by his boss, President Donald Trump, in Doonbeg. That's 181 miles — or an hour's drive plus a 40-minute flight — away from the government buildings where Pence will conduct his official visit on Tuesday.
Pence also happens to have family..."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) on Thursday apologized for a scandal in which top aides closed access lanes to a bridge as an apparent act of political retribution, saying he was “embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team.”
Christie said he had fired deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly, one of the aides apparently responsible for the closure, and has told Bill Stepien, his 2013 campaign manager, not to apply to become state Republican Party chairman or to work with the..."
"A NASA spacecraft rammed an asteroid at blistering speed Monday in an unprecedented dress rehearsal for the day a killer rock menaces Earth.
The galactic slam occurred at a harmless asteroid 7 million miles (11.3 million kilometers) away, with the spacecraft named Dart plowing into the space rock at 14,000 mph (22,500 kph). Scientists expected the impact to carve out a crater, hurl streams of rocks and dirt into space and, most importantly, alter the asteroid’s orbit.
“We have impact!” Mission Control’s Elena Adams announced, jumping up and down and..."
"George Floyd’s brother Philonise pleaded in an emotional and powerful statement to members of Congress on Wednesday that they pass police reforms and listen to the calls around the world to ""stop the pain.""
""I can't tell you the kind of pain you feel when you watch something like that -- when you watch your big brother, who you looked up to your whole entire life, die, die begging for his mom,"" he told members of the House Judiciary Committee, describing the video footage that showed his brother's death in..."
"President Joe Biden secured a victory to end one policy that keeps migrants in Mexico while they awaited their asylum court hearing. Now, the administration could move to end another Trump-era immigration policy.
The Supreme Court’s ruling that allows the Biden administration to end the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” could make legal injunctions on other immigration cases illegal, some legal experts are arguing. 
Title 42, a public health order issued by the Trump administration, allows Customs and Border Protection to expel migrants to Mexico or back to their home countries to..."
"A federal judge on Thursday ordered that Michael D. Cohen be released into home confinement after finding that federal officials had returned him to prison in retaliation for his plans to write a tell-all memoir about President Trump.
The judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court, said Mr. Cohen was sent back to prison this month after several weeks of medical furlough because of his desire to publish a book before the election about his years as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer and fixer.
“I make the finding that the..."
"Facing a rebellion among their most conservative ranks, House Republicans were forced on Thursday to scuttle an emergency spending measure to address the surge of young Central American migrants at the southern border, in a major embarrassment to the new leadership team.
House Republicans, who have long called for strengthening security at the nation’s southern border, are now forced to head home for the five-week August recess with nothing to show for their efforts — something many Republicans fear will be an enormous political liability.
The blow to Speaker John..."
"The House descended into chaos on Thursday, unable to plot a path forward on a bill to address the border crisis.
After initially pulling their $659 million border bill, Republicans planned to huddle behind closed doors, raising the possibility that some type of vote could still happen later in the day."
"The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress. She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agencys actions."
"Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS unit handling tax-exempt status, invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
She is in the spotlight following a Treasury inspector general's report that found her unit used political criteria to screen applications for tax-exempt status from tea party and other conservative organizations.
Lerner joins a long line of officials who ""took the Fifth"" when called to testify before Congress."
"The United States on Friday once again saw a record number of Covid-19 cases, when more than 98,500 infections were reported, according to an NBC News tally.
It's the fifth time since Oct. 22 that a new daily case record was set. Across the country, 98,583 new infections were reported Friday.
The U.S. reported 978 deaths Friday, according to an NBC News count.
The last benchmark of 90,456 cases was hit Thursday, just hours after the U.S. logged its 9 millionth coronavirus case and shattered the previous daily record of..."
"The nation’s homelessness problem has to a disturbing degree become California’s homelessness problem. While the latest counts compiled by the federal government show that America’s homeless population is growing again after more than a decade of declines, the entire national increase and more can be attributed to California alone.
With a majority of states experiencing decreases in homelessness over the past year and only one small state, New Mexico, suffering a larger proportionate increase, California’s dire statistics underscore the extent to which state and local policies drive an extraordinary and..."
"President Trump spent part of the Christmas holiday attacking California Democrats over the homelessness crisis in their state, adding another volley of tweets to his long-running criticism of one of the state’s most pressing issues.
Trump has directed his administration to examine ways to crack down on the homeless populations in several major cities but has reserved particular frustration for California, whose governor, Gavin Newsom (D), has positioned the state as a liberal counterbalance to the Trump administration’s policies. Trump frequently portrays the homelessness in the state as emblematic of..."
"Amid growing calls from health officials across the country, the Biden administration declared the current monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency in the U.S. on Thursday afternoon.
The declaration, which was made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, comes a little less than two weeks after the World Health Organization designated the outbreak an emergency of international concern.
By issuing a declaration, HHS will be able to take a series of actions including accessing funds set aside for such an emergency as well as appointing personnel to positions directly..."
"Millions of working people and small-business owners who cannot earn money while sheltering at home are facing economic ruin. So dozens of states, seeking to ease the pain, are coming out of lockdown.
Most have not met even minimal criteria for doing so safely, and some are reopening even as coronavirus cases rise, inviting disaster. The much-feared “second wave” of infection may not wait until fall, many scientists say, and instead may become a storm of wavelets breaking unpredictably across the country.
The reopenings will proceed nonetheless. The question now,..."
"Iraq’s powerful Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr announced he is quitting political life for good and closing his political offices in a move that could further inflame tensions in the country.
Gunfire rang out in the Green Zone and security forces launched tear gas cannisters on Monday to disperse al-Sadr supporters converging on the area. At least two people were killed and 19 wounded, police and medical workers said.
Al-Sadr’s statement, published on Twitter, came after months of protests by supporters backing his call for the dissolution of the Iraqi parliament, which has seen 10..."
"Hamas on Sunday agreed to observe a 24-hour truce in Gaza after initially rejecting a similar Israeli offer, as fighting resumed and the two sides wrangled over the terms of a lull that international diplomats had hoped could be expanded into a more sustainable truce.
After Israel announced a 24-hour truce late Saturday, Palestinian militants fired rockets deep into Israel, prompting it to resume an offensive aimed at destroying rocket launchers and cross-border attack tunnels used by Hamas, the Islamic militant group ruling the coastal strip."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Hamas is already violating its own cease-fire that it proposed Sunday morning.
“Hamas doesn’t even accept it’s own cease-fire. It’s continuing to fire at us as we speak,"" he said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
Hamas announced a 24-hour cease-fire with Israel beginning at 2 p.m. local time. But Netanyahu said that Hamas hadn't abided by its own announcement, saying it has not ceased in its campaign against the Israel on Sunday.
“Hamas is simply continuing all its operations, and Israel will..."
"Lunch is on the menu, but thats probably about it.

"President Joe Biden on Friday will nominate federal appeals court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a person familiar with the matter, making her the first Black woman selected to serve on a court that once declared her race unworthy of citizenship and endorsed segregation.
In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first..."
"As the omicron surge pummels a pandemic-weary nation, the first antiviral pills for Covid-19 promise desperately needed protection for people at risk of severe disease. However, many people prescribed Pfizer’s or Merck’s new medications will require careful monitoring by doctors and pharmacists, and the antivirals may not be safe for everyone, experts caution.
The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer’s Paxlovid for mild to moderate Covid in people as young as 12 who have underlying conditions that raise the risk of hospitalization and death from the coronavirus, such as heart disease or diabetes. However, one..."
"Applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose for a second week, underscoring the uneven nature of the labor market recovery.
Initial claims in regular state programs increased by 16,000 to 744,000 in the week ended April 3, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey estimated 680,000 claims. The prior week’s data was revised up to 728,000. California and New York led states with the biggest increases in unadjusted claims.
The increase in claims shows the labor market still has a long way to go to recover..."
"President Barack Obama’s new climate initiative will impose deadlines for EPA to write rules throttling carbon dioxide emissions at U.S. power plants, part of a series of efforts that could hit the coal industry hard both at home and abroad — but also create jobs and spark the economy, the administration says."
"A federal judge in Louisiana has for now blocked the Biden administration from ending a Trump-era pandemic restriction, known as Title 42, at the US-Mexico border, thwarting plans to terminate the controversial public health authority.
Since taking office, President Joe Biden’s administration has continued to rely on Title 42, a public health authority invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic that allows border officials to turn migrants away at the US-Mexico border.
In early April, though, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced plans to terminate the order. The..."
"New York City officials on Tuesday agreed to a grim coronavirus-era budget that will sharply curtail municipal services, impose a hiring freeze and, in a move meant to placate calls to defund the police, shift roughly $1 billion from the Police Department.
The $88.1 billion budget reflected the economic shutdown that followed the outbreak, causing a $9 billion revenue shortfall that forced the city to make drastic across-the-board spending cuts.
But the virus was not the only external factor that affected the budget.
The protests that followed the police killing..."
"As calls to defund the police grow louder around the country, New York City officials agreed on a budget that shifts roughly $1 billion from the police department, but advocates and lawmakers say the change doesn't go far enough.
The city council said in a statement Tuesday that the city's 2021 budget, totaling more than $88 billion, ""reduces police spending and shrinks NYPD's footprint."" The cuts came as the city is grappling with losing $9 billion in revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The budget cuts nearly $484 million from the..."
"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday presented a partial breakdown of coronavirus deaths by race.
The governor emphasized the breakdown was based on limited data, which has been an issue across the state because many reports of new cases and deaths don’t include racial identifiers.
With about 37% of patients identified by race, here is a breakdown of infections statewide:
Latino 30%
Asian 14%
Black 6%
Here is a breakdown of deaths on which the state had racial data:
Latino 29%
Asian 16%
Black 3%
The data..."
"The U.S. is poised to begin rolling out booster shots in a matter of weeks, with still one major sticking point to resolve: It's not entirely clear yet that third shots are needed.
President Joe Biden recently vowed to begin deploying boosters the week of Sept. 20, pending a green light from federal regulators.
But health experts advising the government on that decision say the August announcement by Biden's political appointees came as somewhat of a surprise. It also was unclear, they said, why that date was chosen at all.
Evidence for boosters is still mixed, and announcing a..."
"President Trump lashed out at Democrats, contending the deck is stacked against him, hours before a historic, nationally televised impeachment hearing was set to begin Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.
The first open hearing in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, scheduled for 10 a.m., will feature testimony from William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.
Democrats see both diplomats as key to building their case in the inquiry, which was prompted by a complaint from..."
"Officials said FBI Director James B. Comey was dismissed after senior Justice Department officials concluded he had violated department principles and procedures by publicly discussing an investigation of Clinton’s use of private email. Just last week, President Trump publicly accused Comey of giving Clinton, his Democratic challenger for president, “a free pass for many bad deeds’’ when he decided not to recommend criminal charges in the case."
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey after his attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended his removal.
In a signed letter, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau."""
"Remote instruction. Virtual learning. School-by-Zoom. Whatever you want to call it, it has kept this Black man — along with my wife and 7-year-old son — safe from Covid over the last year, even if it hasn’t been easy on anyone. Each day, as my son sits at his desk in our home near Washington learning about bar graphs on a laptop screen, I am comforted by the knowledge that he’s not sitting in a poorly ventilated classroom at risk of getting sick.
While my wife and I managed to..."
"When students return to school in Uvalde today, just 15 weeks after the deadliest school shooting in Texas history, 19 students and two teachers will not be present.
In just more than three months since the massacre, residents have sought to help children return to normalcy with familiar back-to-school rituals, tinged by grief.
In August, one family from Lockhart donated nearly 800 backpacks to students. The next day, an annual wellness fair at the Uvalde civic center included a booth with information on how to care for children and parents’..."
"President Joe Biden on Wednesday gathered world leaders virtually to discuss a plan for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 4 million people globally, announcing the U.S. would donate another half billion doses of Pfizer vaccine to lower-income nations.
The White House's stated goal for the summit, happening at the same time as the U.N. General Assembly, was to get world leaders to commit to increasing vaccination rates, making live-saving measures more widely available globally and aligning global targets for fighting the pandemic."
"The White House’s desire for a payroll tax cut and spending curbs was instantly confronted with bipartisan opposition.
Top administration officials will head to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a full day of meetings after some of President Trump’s priorities in the next coronavirus spending package met with bipartisan resistance, prompting one GOP senator to call Trump’s pitch a “first draft.”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows will meet with Republicans and Democrats about the tax and spending package. White House officials said they..."
"Timothy Thibault, a top-level FBI agent who had been under fire for his role in investigations regarding President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, resigned late last week and was walked out of the FBI, two U.S. officials confirmed. But these officials also said that Thibault had reached retirement age, and they added that all of those who retire hand over their badge and gun and are escorted out of the building.
Thibault, who worked in the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., had recently been removed from his position as assistant special agent..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Senate will vote on a ""targeted"" coronavirus relief package this week as negotiations between Democrats and the White House over a larger measure remain stalled.
""Today, the Senate Republican majority is introducing a new targeted proposal, focused on some of the very most urgent healthcare, education, and economic issues. It does not contain every idea our party likes. I am confident Democrats will feel the same,"" McConnell said in a statement on Tuesday morning. ""Yet Republicans believe the many serious differences between our..."
"Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Republicans in Congress are ""playing with fire"" and that there is ""no option"" available for the president if they refuse to raise the debt ceiling.
Some Republicans have suggested that once the debt ceiling is breached, President Barack Obama could take action on his own to prevent the country from entering into default, triggering cascading world financial problems."
"Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas linked raising the debt ceiling to funding the Affordable Care Act in an exclusive interview Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union” with Candy Crowley.
“The debt ceiling historically has been among the best leverage that Congress has to rein in the executive,"" Cruz said.
He listed three objectives as Republicans approach the debt ceiling.
""No. 1, we should look for some significant structural plan and reduce government spending. No. 2, we should avoid new taxes, and No. 3, we should look for ways to..."
"The House makes an early return from its August recess Monday as Democratic leaders seek to string together the votes to advance President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion economic package, a centerpiece of his agenda.
But progressives and moderates are clashing over strategy, and the party doesn't have agreement on how to move forward yet.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plan to move the bill in tandem with the Senate-passed infrastructure legislation is threatened by a rebellion by moderate Democrats, who have insisted that the $550 billion infrastructure bill get a speedy vote and be signed into..."
"Aaron Persky, the California judge who drew national attention in 2016 when he sentenced a Stanford student to just six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, was recalled on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press.

"BLACKBURN, England — The British man named by the F.B.I. as the person who took four people hostage at a Texas synagogue on Saturday had serious mental health issues and arguably should not have been able to travel to America at all, his brother said in an interview on Monday.
Malik Faisal Akram, 44, from Blackburn in northwestern England, was killed after an 11-hour standoff with the police and law enforcement officers at the Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, near Fort Worth, the F.B.I. said.
His brother Gulbar Akram described him..."
"The big climate and health care bill signed into law by President Biden has what at first sight looks like a big incentive for those shopping for a car: a revamped $7,500 tax credit if you buy a new electric vehicle, or $4,000 if you get a used one.
Although tax credits for electric cars have been offered before, the new bill revamps those incentives. But there are so many caveats — on everything from the buyers' income level to which models can qualify — that many electric cars may..."
"President Biden’s economic advisers are pulling together a sweeping $3 trillion package to boost the economy, reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality, beginning with a giant infrastructure plan that may be financed in part through tax increases on corporations and the rich.
After months of internal debate, Mr. Biden’s advisers are expected to present the spending proposal to the president and congressional leaders this week, as well as begin outreach to industry and labor groups. On Monday, Mr. Biden’s national climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, discussed his infrastructure plans —..."
"PHILADELPHIA – President Donald Trump denied downplaying the threat from coronavirus, telling a town hall on Tuesday that he ""up played it"" despite his assertion in a recorded interview this year that he ""wanted to always play it down.""
Trump made the remarks during a 90-minute town hall hosted by ABC News in the must win battleground of Pennsylvania, an event that served as something of a preview for the presidential debates that are set to begin later this month.
""Well, I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many..."
"As the 2020 Tour de France comes to its final stages, I thought I would use some cycling metaphors to assess the town hall meeting ABC News held with President Donald Trump, seven weeks ahead of Election Day.
The Tour is one of the most grueling and difficult sporting events in the world, and is often described as a ""team sport with an individual winner."" the same is true of presidential campaigns. They are incredibly grueling, politically, and there is one winner declared after Election Day. But in order to..."
"A new poll out from the Washington Post and ABC News -- conducted half before the Ryan announcement and half afterward -- found that positive views of the now-VP candidate jumped this weekend following his addition to the GOP ticket. Via The Fix:
In Wednesday through Friday interviews, fully 45 percent of Americans expressed no opinion of Ryan, dropping to 30 percent on Saturday and Sunday. The increasing familiarity all went to the positive side of the ledger, giving Ryan an initial advantage in the sprint to define his candidacy...."
"Americans' initial reaction to Paul Ryan is decidedly lukewarm, with more rating his selection as vice president negatively than positively, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll taken after the announcement.
Ryan's ratings were less positive than those for any other vice presidential pick part of Gallup since 2000, including Sarah Palin, Joe Biden and Dick Cheney. The only other recent vice presidential selection to gain net negative ratings was Dan Quayle in 1988."
"President Barack Obama this week will propose a plan to extend overtime pay to 5 million American workers who are currently excluded under federal law, according to sources.
The president will recommend updating overtime rules so that salaried workers who earn less than roughly $50,400 per year would be guaranteed time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. Under the current rules implemented by former President George W. Bush, salaried workers must earn less than $23,660 per year in order to be automatically eligible for overtime..."
"Soon after President Joe Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for a seat on the Supreme Court her critics began casting her as a ""radical, left-wing activist,"" a characterization based on a handful of high-profile opinions in which she ruled against President Donald Trump's administration. 
But a deeper review of Jackson's  opinions on the federal District Court in Washington, D.C., paints a more nuanced picture, including a number of instances in which she sided with the Republican administration and against the same left-leaning groups that now support her confirmation. 
Critics often point to a 2019 decision in which Jackson ruled that Trump's former White..."
"The first congressional hearing on IRS targeting of conservative groups began Friday with the House Ways and Means Committee looking at what it called political discrimination.
However, partisan politics became evident early when the top Republican and Democrat on the committee differed on the underlying purpose of the hearing.
Two key figures in the controversy -- the acting Internal Revenue Service commissioner forced to resign and the agency inspector general who uncovered the issue -- were sworn in as witnesses by panel chairman Rep. Dave Camp, a Republican..."
"Steven Miller, the ousted acting IRS Commissioner, is facing harsh criticism from top lawmakers in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing that is under way this morning.
Hes facing questions about why the agency didnt reveal a program that targeted conservative groups seeking nonprofit status despite repeated requests from Republican lawmakers."
"Sweeping communications outages continued to plague large swaths of Tennessee on Saturday after a recreational vehicle exploded early Christmas morning in downtown Nashville. Meanwhile, federal investigators are searching for clues after the explosion that damaged dozens of buildings.
Police emergency systems across Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as Nashville's COVID-19 community hotline, remained out of service due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it - but the company has declined to say exactly how many people..."
"U.S. health officials on Monday cut isolation restrictions for asymptomatic Americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days, and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said the guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.
The decision also was driven by a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, propelled by the omicron variant.
Early research suggests omicron may cause milder..."
"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday shortened the recommended times that people should isolate when they've tested positive for Covid-19 from 10 days to five days if they don't have symptoms -- and if they wear a mask around others for at least five more days.
The CDC also shortened the recommended time for people to quarantine if they are exposed to the virus to a similar five days if they are vaccinated. People who are fully vaccinated and boosted may not need to quarantine at all, the CDC said.

"The publication of nearly 3,000 previously classified files relating to the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963 reveals that the FBI had warned Dallas police about a threat to kill Lee Harvey Oswald, and claims that Soviet officials feared an “irresponsible” US general could launch a missile strike in the wake of the crisis."
As George W. Bushs presidential library opens supporters of the 43rd president are convinced that history will judge him more kindly than his contemporaries. In order for that to happen historians say they need to get a look at the documents that library houses and that doesnt look likely anytime soon.
"Republican US Senator Lisa Murkowski has said she was “disturbed” by the Senate leader’s approach to working with White House counsel on the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, saying there should be distance between the two.
The comments by the Alaska lawmaker come after Mitch McConnell, majority leader of the Republican-led Senate, said during a Fox News interview earlier this month that he was working in “total coordination” with the White House on the upcoming trial.
“To me it means that we have to take that step back from..."
"Senate Republicans are having trouble coming to grips with the new coronavirus relief bill outlined by their own party leaders Monday afternoon.
Many want to see changes, still more think the price tag is far too high and all of it is pointing to a major, uphill slog as the party attempts to craft a possible compromise with Democrats -- this as millions of Americans lose crucial benefits in the face of inaction in Washington.
""It's a mess. I can't figure out what this bill's about. ...This is not going..."
"More than 400 American millionaires and billionaires are sending a letter to Congress this week urging Republican lawmakers not to cut their taxes. The wealthy Americans — including doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs and chief executives — say the GOP is making a mistake by reducing taxes on the richest families at a time when the nation's debt is high and inequality is back at the worst level since the 1920s."

"As the chants of angry protesters filled the Capitol, Michigan lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to right-to-work legislation, dealing a devastating and once-unthinkable defeat to organized labor in a state that has been a cradle of the movement for generations.
The Republican-dominated House ignored Democrats' pleas to delay the passage and instead approved two bills with the same ruthless efficiency as the Senate showed last week. One measure dealt with private sector workers, the other with government employees. Both were sent to Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who pledged to sign..."
"DNA testing has established, “with scientific certainty,” that Hunter Biden is the father of an Arkansas baby, according to a motion filed Wednesday in Independence County on behalf of the child’s mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts.

"Six former employees of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said they were contacted by his office in the days after an ex-aide accused the governor of sexual harassment in December, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
Some of the people who were called said they hadn't heard from the administration in months and saw the calls as intimidation attempts, according to the newspaper.
“I felt intimidated, and I felt bewildered,” said Ana Liss, a former aide to the governor who received one of the calls. Liss has also accused the..."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s grip on power appeared increasingly threatened Thursday as a majority of state legislators called for his resignation, Democrats launched an impeachment investigation and police in the state capital said they stood ready to investigate a groping allegation.
The firestorm around the Democrat grew a day after the Times Union of Albany reported that an unidentified aide had claimed Cuomo reached under her shirt and fondled her at his official residence late last year.
The woman hasn’t filed a criminal complaint, but a lawyer for the..."
"Between the presidential election, governors’ races, and down-ballot contests, this year’s election features a lot of important choices. Among those, voters in five states will have a chance to legalize marijuana for recreational or medical uses.
In Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota, voters could legalize marijuana for recreational purposes. In Mississippi and South Dakota (in a ballot initiative separate from the full legalization measure), voters could also legalize medical marijuana.
If all these measures are approved, the United States would go from having 11 states in which marijuana..."
"A week ago, it looked like the world's two biggest economies were close to resolving their ongoing trade dispute. Now, the United States is imposing a new round of punishing tariff increases on Chinese goods.

"President Trump renewed his trade fight with China on Friday morning, hours after raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of the country’s imports, as he tried to pressure Beijing to agree to America’s trade terms.
In a series of early morning tweets, the president said tariffs on Chinese goods will help the United States and warned China that he would continue to tax their products if they didn’t reach a deal. His comments, which come as the two countries prepare to meet again on Friday, suggest Mr. Trump is willing..."
"Thank you for carefully rinsing, sorting, and recycling your plastic containers — but plastic is trash and trying to recycle it is futile, Greenpeace said in late October. Greenpeace and other environmental groups have been warning about the petroleum and chemical industry's ""greenwashing"" of plastic recycling for years, while those chemical companies insist we're just on the cusp of a major breakthrough that will make recycling and reusing plastics feasible and cost-effective. 
Consumers, meanwhile, are stuck in the middle. Is recycling plastic just a feel-good charade we should stop bothering to play act, or is there..."
"Ohio voters will pick nominees for vacant House seats today, settling a fight over Democratic Party loyalty in Cleveland and testing the power of Donald Trump’s endorsement in Columbus’s conservative exurbs.
In the 11th Congressional District, which stretches from Cleveland to Akron, former state senator Nina Turner is locked in a bitter fight with Shontel Brown, a Cuyahoga County councilor and chair of the local Democratic Party. Turner, who co-chaired Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) last presidential campaign, entered the race as the best-known candidate, and an ally of the left-wing..."
"On the left and among Democrats, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade on Friday was an earthshaking event. It prompted demonstrations across the country, a torrent of outrage and despair on social media, and big political speeches — including President Biden and other Democrats saying that “Roe is on the ballot” in this fall’s midterm elections.
The reaction was far more casual on the right. In conversations with over a half-dozen Republican insiders, who were granted anonymity to discuss the political ramifications frankly, there was a lingering..."
"Rescue crews piloted boats and waded through flooded streets Thursday to save thousands of Floridians trapped after Hurricane Ian destroyed homes and businesses and left millions in the dark.
Hours after weakening to a tropical depression while crossing the Florida peninsula, Ian regained hurricane strength Thursday evening after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center predicted it would make landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane Friday.
The devastation inflicted on Florida began to come into focus a day after Ian struck as one of the strongest hurricanes ever to..."

"An unrepentant Donald Trump has denied inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol, in an attempt to shift blame Democrats rejected as “despicable”.
The president spoke to reporters for the first time since a pro-Trump mob rampaged through the Capitol last week, leaving five people dead. Democrats accuse him of stoking violence and could vote to impeach him on Wednesday.

"Of all the comments from all the opportunists seeking to make political capital from a dying child, the most asinine, surely, comes from former US congressman Joe Walsh. The talk radio provocateur took to Twitter this week to ask: “Why does an American need an AR-15?” His answer: “To make sure what’s happening to #AlfieEvans never happens here. That’s why.” As an NHS palliative care doctor, I assume Walsh is advocating semi-automatic assault rifles to protect against people like me. As a mother, I can scarcely comprehend someone using a..."

The President took the brunt of criticism immediately after the White House announ"
"By the time Senator Angus King called the White House to warn President Obama against taking executive action to overhaul the immigration system, officials were well aware they had a problem on their hands.
What had once looked like a clear political imperative for both parties — action to grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants — had morphed instead into what appeared to be a risky move that could cost Democrats their majority in the November midterm congressional elections.
But Mr. King, a Maine independent who is a..."
"Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L, which the Supreme Court heard on Wednesday, is a tough case. And it’s not tough because it presents the kind of politically toxic questions that often cause the justices to retreat into their partisan corners.
Members of the Court from across the political spectrum spent Wednesday morning struggling to determine when a school district should be allowed to discipline students for speech that they engage in when they are not at school or engaged in any kind of school-sponsored activity. The question has become..."
"A wary Supreme Court on Wednesday weighed whether public schools can discipline students for things they say off campus, worrying about overly restricting speech on the one hand and leaving educators powerless to deal with bullying on the other.
The justices, hearing arguments in the case of a 14-year-old high school freshman’s Snapchat F-bombs, struggled to fit the need to protect students’ political and religious expression with the ability of schools to get at disruptive, even potentially dangerous, speech that occurs outside the school setting.
In one of many examples..."
"The publication is small, reaching just a fraction of the evangelical movement.
But when Christianity Today called for President Trump’s removal in a blistering editorial on Thursday, it met the full force and fury of the president and his most prominent allies in the Christian conservative world. If the response seemed disproportionate, it vividly reflected the fact that white evangelicals are the cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s political base and their leaders are among his most visible and influential supporters."
"NEW YORK (AP) — A major evangelical Christian magazine founded by the late Rev. Billy Graham on Thursday published an editorial calling for President Donald Trump’s removal from office.
The editorial in Christianity Today -- coming one day after the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives made Trump the third president in American history to be impeached -- raised fresh questions about the durability of his support among the conservative evangelicals who have proven to be a critical component of his political base."
"President Trump said Friday Russia should be readmitted to the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which the country was suspended from after its invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014. He made the remarks as he prepared to head to Canada for the annual G7 summit, and they add to a list of positions that put the U.S. in opposition to many of its allies ahead of what will likely be a bruising meeting over trade, Iran, and other issues.
“It used to be the G8 because Russia..."
"President Trump is calling on the G-7 to re-admit Russia to the group of leading economic powers, saying ""we should have Russia at the negotiating table.""
Moscow was kicked out of the group, then the G-8, four years ago after it annexed Crimea. It had been invited to join the group in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But after Russia's intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, Western leaders sought to isolate Vladimir Putin's government.

"President Donald Trump signed into law Friday afternoon a historic $2 trillion stimulus package as the American public and the US economy fight the devastating spread of Covid-19.
The far-reaching legislation stands as the largest emergency aid package in US history. It represents a massive financial injection into a struggling economy with provisions aimed at helping American workers, small businesses and industries grappling with the economic disruption.
The House of Representatives earlier in the day approved the bill that passed the Senate earlier this week, overcoming last-minute drama by using..."
"Ten months into the pandemic, the prospect of reopening K-12 schools is divisive. Yet unlike wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus — a politicized act which is scientifically proven to work — there is far more nuance between the ""right"" and ""wrong"" option for in-person schooling. And it can be wildly variable depending on the region.
Recently, Chicago has found itself facing this very question of reopening schools. Mayor Lori Lightfoot hoped to reopen public schools today for the first time since March, though her plans..."
"The New York Times published an article that quickly made the rounds among political insiders, especially in the Republican Party. Its lede was straightforward:
For months, former President Donald J. Trump has been grumbling quietly to friends and visitors to his Palm Beach mansion about a rival Republican power center in another Florida mansion, some 400 miles to the north. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a man Mr. Trump believes he put on the map, has been acting far less like an acolyte and more like a future competitor, Mr. Trump complains. With his..."
"All eyes are on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday.
After the House overwhelmingly voted to both override President Donald Trump's veto on the National Defense Authorization Act and to pass $2,000 stimulus checks, it's Senate Republicans' turn to navigate whether they're willing to cross Trump in his final days in office.
Watch McConnell when he opens the Senate floor. The majority leader notably has not made any public commitments about how he plans to handle $2,000 checks despite the fact that Trump insisted he'd obtained a promise that..."
"Conservatives on the Supreme Court on Monday upheld Ohio’s method of purging voters from the rolls after they miss elections.
The court ruled 5 to 4 that Ohio’s process does not violate federal law. The dissenters said it could result in thousands of infrequent voters losing their right to vote.
Unlike many voting cases that come before the court, Wednesday’s case centered not on grand constitutional principles but on interpreting seemingly contradictory directives of federal law.
Beyond the prohibition on removing voters because they failed to vote, the law calls..."
"Failing to vote can lead to getting knocked off voter registration rolls, a divided Supreme Court ruled Monday in a decision that likely will help Republicans and harm Democrats.
The court's conservative majority ruled 5-4 that Ohio did not violate federal laws by purging voters who don't vote and fail to return notices confirming their residency. Civil rights groups had challenged the state for having the strictest method of purging voters in the nation.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, noting right off the bat that an estimated one..."
"Brittany Commisso, the woman who last week filed a criminal complaint against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for groping her, is going public and pushing back against the governor’s claim that he never touched anyone inappropriately.
“It’s simple. I know the truth,” Commisso told “CBS This Morning” in an interview that aired Monday. “He knows the truth. I know what happened, and so does he.”
Commisso was known only as “Executive Assistant #1” in the report released last week by the New York attorney general’s office, which concluded that Cuomo had..."
"Laws preventing firearms dealers from selling handguns to young adults under age 21 are unconstitutional, a federal appeals court said Tuesday in a ruling that could have implications for efforts to restrict such sales nationally.
In a divided decision, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the existing minimum age requirement for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers restricts the rights of law-abiding citizens and draws an arbitrary, unjustified line.
“Despite the weighty interest in reducing crime and violence, we refuse to relegate either..."

The day before Biden takes office, his nominees for secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, director of national intelligence, defense secretary and secretary of Homeland Security will appear before Senate committees to be considered for their respective roles.
Biden is set to take office on Wednesday without key members of his Cabinet in place, as the Republican-controlled Senate has moved more slowly to schedule confirmation hearings..."
"President Barack Obama told a United Nations meeting on Tuesday that pollution must be contained to address climate change.
Specifically, he called out China, saying that the most populous country on Earth, with the fastest increase in carbon pollution, must join the United States to lead the rest of the world in carbon reduction.

"President Obama, emboldened by his use of executive powers to fight climate change at home, challenged China on Tuesday to make the same effort to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions and join a worldwide campaign to curb global warming.
Declaring that the United States and China — the world’s two largest economies and largest polluters — bear a “special responsibility to lead,” Mr. Obama said, “That’s what big nations have to do.”

"The U.S. is recommending a “pause” in administration of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to investigate reports of potentially dangerous blood clots.
In a joint statement Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said they were investigating unusual clots in six women that occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. The clots occurred in veins that drain blood from the brain and occurred together with low platelets. All six cases were in women between the ages of 18 and 48.

"After a disappointing finish in South Carolina, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced Monday she was ending her presidential campaign.
Klobuchar’s exit came just weeks after a surprise third-place showing in the New Hampshire primary, which she hoped would propel her through the rest of the early states and onto Super Tuesday. But she finished in sixth place in both the Nevada caucuses and South Carolina primary."
"Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is suspending her presidential campaign after failing to break into the top tier of Democratic candidates.
She plans to drop out of the race and endorse former Vice President Joe Biden in Dallas on Monday night, according to her campaign.
It's just hours before polls open in her home state of Minnesota on Super Tuesday.
Klobuchar saw a surge of momentum and fundraising after a strong debate performance and a third-place showing in the New Hampshire primary, but she struggled to expand or sustain that support..."
"It was a low point for House Democrats hoping to build a case to remove President Trump from office — a committee hearing in which former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski made his questioners look hapless with a flurry of deflections and delays.
“I heard it did not go well,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told one of her fellow leaders, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), hours after he had participated in the Sept. 17 hearing, according to officials familiar with their conversation. Another top Democrat, Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth..."
"WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants to move ""expeditiously"" on the impeachment inquiry into whether President Donald Trump abused his power by pushing Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.
At the center of the inquiry, which was launched last week, is a complaint from an unidentified intelligence agency official. The complaint accuses Trump of having ""used the power of his office"" to solicit foreign interference to discredit Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner. It also alleges that White House officials sought to ""lock down"" records of..."
"Two senators on Tuesday urged Congress to move quickly on bipartisan legislation that would provide legal status to the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States since they were children, and now face losing protection from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program."
"For 16 years, advocates for legalizing young immigrants brought here illegally by their parents have tried to pass legislation to shield them from deportation. The bill was called the Dream Act, and in Congresses Democratic and Republican, and in the Bush and Obama administrations, whether by stand-alone bill or comprehensive immigration legislation, it failed again and again."
"President Barack Obama is urging Congress to reinstate jobless benefits for more than a million Americans.
In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama says the unemployment insurance is a ""vital economic lifeline"" for many people. And he says failure to reinstate the benefits will cause the economy to slow for all Americans."
"Congress will start the new year with an old fight: whether to extend jobless benefits for 1.3 million long-term unemployed.
They expired last week when lawmakers failed to continue a 2008 recession-era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out.
Democrats argue the program is needed to sustain economic recovery and offer a lifeline to those struggling to keep their head above water financially."

"When the Great Plague struck Marseille in 1720, killing more than half of the city’s population, travellers were ordered to carry a “bill of health” and ships arriving at the Mediterranean port underwent a 40-day cordon sanitaire or quarantine. As a gateway for trade, the city authorities struggled to find a delicate balance between halting the spread of the disease and damaging vital commerce.
Three hundred years on, President Emmanuel Macron is walking an equally tricky tightrope just eight months before he seeks re-election in April 2022. And unlike the ancient Marseillais, Macron has..."

Yet Clinton and her well-known husband have been preparing for this possibility, building her ground game across primary states that follow New Hampshire and can help her definitively put away Sanders. Sanders may have a younger demographic secured, but Clinton could have a wider spread of voters that overshadows his more limited base."

"For the past painful year, the Republican presidential contenders have been bombarding Americans with empty propaganda slogans and competing, bizarrely, to present themselves as the least experienced person for the most important elected job in the world. Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.
Hillary Clinton would be the first woman nominated by a major party. She served as a senator from a major state..."
"The president's decision to seek congressional approval for a military strike against Syria came out of the blue — none of his national security team saw it coming, according to three senior administration officials.

The news comes amid rising tensions in the region, with American officials blaming Iran for what they said was an attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week. Iran has denied any involvement.

“Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,” said Navy Captain Bill..."

The drama long ago ran out in Kentucky’s once-hyped race between Sen.

"Nearly 100 million U.S. workers will be required to get the COVID vaccine by Jan. 4, with some workers allowed to test weekly instead, under sweeping federal rules released Thursday by the Biden administration that identifies COVID-19 as an occupational hazard.
The regulations are aimed at health care workers and businesses with 100 or more employees, covering two-thirds of the nation’s workforce. Businesses that don’t comply could be fined $14,000 per infraction, and hospitals could lose access to Medicare and Medicaid dollars.

The study, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, examined the risk of reinfection during May and June among hundreds of Kentucky residents who tested positive for the virus in 2020.
Those who did not get vaccinated this year faced a risk of reinfection that was 2.34 higher than those..."

"Twitter has applied its first ""manipulated media"" label to a video retweeted by President Donald Trump, as first reported by The Washington Post.
The tweet was originally shared by the White House's head of social media, Dan Scavino, and it contains a video that appears to show the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden stumble during a speech and accidentally endorse President Donald Trump, saying, ""We can only reelect Donald Trump.""
In reality, however, Biden went on to say: ""We can only reelect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged..."
"Twitter applied its new “manipulated media” label for the first time on Sunday to a deceptively edited video of former vice president Joe Biden. The video was shared by White House social media director Dan Scavino and retweeted by President Trump.
The video was the first test of a new policy the social media company implemented March 5 to label tweets that contain manipulated or synthetic media, ranging from edited videos to more sophisticated examples known as “deepfakes” that can fabricate events that never happened.

"The Biden administration is developing plans for Venezuelans with financial sponsors to be granted parole to enter the United States, similar to how Ukrainians have been admitted after Russia’s invasion, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
Four officials offered broad outlines of the plan to deal with a large increase in Venezuelans arriving at the U.S. border with Mexico. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Venezuelans who cross the border illegally on land would be immediately returned to Mexico, two officials said. Currently, Mexico only..."

"On September 27th, when Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham delivered a four-minute speech that turned Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation process decisively. An hour earlier, Kavanaugh had delivered a furious, partisan opening statement decrying the sexual-assault allegations against him, which he attributed in part to Democrats seeking “revenge on behalf of the Clintons,” but until Graham’s speech it wasn’t obvious that the Republicans were behind him. “Boy, y’all want power! God, I hope you never get it,” Graham..."
WASHINGTON -- The Senate failed to muster sufficient support Wednesday for a gun-buyer background check bill thats supported by nearly 90 percent of Americans voting the measure down in a procedural vote that likely dooms any major legislation to curb gun violence. The measure -- painstakingly crafted by the bipartisan duo of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) -- was seen as the key to passing the first legislation in decades to address the sorts of mass slaughters that so recently horrified the country in Newtown Conn. where...

"President Trump has pardoned his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who spent years enmeshed in an often bizarre legal war with the government that sprang from the Russia investigation.
Trump announced the news Wednesday on Twitter as Americans prepared to observe the Thanksgiving holiday this week. The pardon brings an end to a long-running legal odyssey for Flynn, who was the only member of the Trump administration to be charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI..."
"President Trump on Wednesday announced he had pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, ending a three-year legal saga that included Flynn’s guilty plea for lying to the FBI, his later effort to withdraw that plea and then a controversial decision by Attorney General William P. Barr to try to drop the case altogether.
Trump’s move marks a full embrace of the retired general he had ousted from the White House after only 22 days on the job — and a final salvo against the Russia investigation that shadowed..."

A new survey reveals that almost two-thirds of medics who responded to it have still not had the vaccine, half believe its delivery to the NHS frontline has been “ad hoc” and a third have no idea when they will be offered it.

Since BuzzFeed published Steele’s reports in 2017, many of the..."
President Obamas professed ignorance of the targeting of conservatives by one government agency and his support of tracking journalists sources by another highlight one of the great paradoxes of his presidency: Sometimes he uses his office as aggressively as anyone whos held it; other times he seems unacquainted with the work of his own administration.
"The Supreme Court on Monday denied an appeal from Republicans challenging a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that allowed ballots received up to three days after Election Day to be counted to accommodate challenges by the coronavirus pandemic.
The court's action is the latest sign that the justices have no interest in cases concerning the 2020 election results. Lawyers for Republicans had argued that the state court exceeded its authority and should have let stand an Election Day deadline passed by the state legislature. Democrats responded that the state court was..."

"Ukraine told residents of its industrial heartland to leave while they still can and urged Western nations to send “weapons, weapons and weapons” Thursday after Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup for an offensive in the country’s east.
Russia’s six-week-old invasion failed to take Ukraine’s capital quickly and achieve what Western countries say was President Vladimir Putin’s initial aim of ousting the Ukrainian government. Russia’s focus is now on the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking region in eastern Ukraine.
In Brussels, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged NATO..."
"Ukraine has called for more heavy weaponry from its western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow as EU member states prepared to halt Russian coal imports but remained divided over a more far-reaching energy ban.
“My agenda is very simple,” the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday before a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. It has only three items on it. It’s weapons, weapons, and weapons.”
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said new western sanctions especially from Europe did not go far enough and Russia would see them as “permission..."
"President Obama won't be giving the speech he might wish tonight.
All presidents accepting their party's re-nomination seek to shift from a message of hope and change to one of progress and accomplishment. Although Obama will certainly talk up the highlights of his term, he won't want to sound triumphant — not with a jobs report due tomorrow that's expected to show a 43rd straight month of U.S. unemployment above 8 percent.

"The U.S. is having one of its worst weeks since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but despite that, few states appear prepared to tighten restrictions to bring the spread of coronavirus under control.
By most metrics, Thursday was one of the worst days since the pandemic began. NBC News reported that there were 77,640 new cases, topping its previous record of more than 75,000 set in July, while the New York Times’ database said there were 75,049 new cases. Even this lower number would make Thursday the second-worst day of the..."
"“I want to feel hopeful about Joe Biden’s chances this year, but I just can’t,” my neighbor confessed to me, as we stood in line outside a coffee shop. What had begun as pleasant conversation—dogs, the temperature, clouds—had been pulled, through the vortex known as Late October in an Election Year, into an airing of political anxieties. “I’m still so afraid that 2016 is going to happen again and Trump is going to win,” she said.
Based on the sample size of my life, every Democrat feels this way. Yes,..."
"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said Tuesday he would resign from office, succumbing to a ballooning sexual harassment scandal that fueled an astonishing reversal of fortune for one of the nation’s best-known leaders.
Mr. Cuomo said his resignation would take effect in 14 days. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, will be sworn in to replace him, becoming the first woman in New York history to occupy the state’s top office.
“Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let..."
"How do you lose the presidency to a man like Donald Trump? He was the most unpopular presidential candidate of all time, compounding blunder with blunder and heaping gaffe upon gaffe. Keeping him from the Oval Office should have been the single-minded mission of the Democratic party. And it should have been easy for them."
"A prominent journalist of the World War II era complained once about the frequent use of the word “boys” when speaking of U.S. troops in the field. After what they’d been through, he said, they were not just a bunch of kids out on an adventure. In fact, the average age of those who died in the Second World War was about 27, and their numbers did include a good many youths. But the term was meant more as an expression of affection and solidarity — “our boys in uniform”..."
"The International Olympic Committee banned the Russian Federation from the upcoming Winter Olympics on Tuesday but left the door open for individual Russian athletes to compete. In a historic act of punishment, Russia’s flag and anthem will be absent from February’s PyeongChang Games in South Korea as consequence for widespread doping that Olympic officials believe was supported by the country’s government."
"DONALD TRUMP HAS DRAGGED America into a moral abyss. And yet Congress, the press, and the public are unwilling to admit that we are now standing in blood. The nation is enabling a murderous demagogue, and we are all complicit.
The president of the United States has murdered a high-ranking official of a foreign government. The assassination last week of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was a state-sponsored murder."
"While Hillary Clinton was rallying with House Democrats at a high-profile meeting Wednesday morning in the Capitol Hill basement, one senior lawmaker was missing.
Connecticut Rep. John Larson skipped the rare session with his party’s presidential hopeful for a face-to-face with the House parliamentarian. Larson had an obscure question about House rules: What would happen if he and a bunch of his colleagues took to the House floor to stage a sit-in protest, effectively shutting down the H"
"John Lewis knows blood. And more than 61 years after he led marchers over the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in the struggle for civil rights, he knows what it means to take a stand.
So it was no mistake that his Democratic colleagues turned to the congressman from Georgia on Wednesday, asking him to lead a new stand by taking over the floor of the United States House of Representatives."
"President Donald Trump and his family are suing Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block subpoenas issued by House Democrats seeking Trump’s financial records.
In the federal lawsuit filed Monday in New York, Trump’s lawyers argued that the subpoenas serve “no legitimate or lawful purpose.”
""The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family, and to ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him..."
"Amazon employees at a 5,800-worker warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, have voted against unionizing, according to a vote count by the National Labor Relations Board. Amazon secured a majority of ""no"" votes in counting that took place Thursday afternoon and Friday morning.
The decision, which was formalized by a vote count at the National Labor Relations Board offices in Atlanta, with 1,798 workers voting against the union and 738 voters in favor of the union. There were 505 contested ballots, however, even taking into account those ballots, Amazon had enough votes..."
"It's debate night in Sin City. Republican presidential candidates are in Las Vegas for their last debate of the year, just seven weeks before the 2016 nominating race gets underway at the Iowa caucuses. And what unfolds on stage at the Venetian casino will have significant implications for the destiny of the GOP nomination."
"In the five weeks since the last Republican presidential debate, terrorists have struck in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Donald J. Trump has proposed barring Muslims from coming to America, Ben Carson’s support has evaporated and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has emerged as Mr. Trump’s stiffest competition. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has gone on the attack against Mr. Cruz, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has less money than many senators up for re-election, has shown signs of life, at least in New Hampshire."
"A controversial Texas law that bars abortions at six weeks went into effect early Wednesday morning after the Supreme Court and a federal appeals court failed to rule on pending emergency requests brought by abortion providers.
The lack of judicial intervention means that the law -- which is one of the strictest in the nation and bans abortion before many people know they are pregnant -- goes into force absent further court intervention.
The law allows private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion..."
"As Election Day nears, President Donald Trump and his supporters are urging greater scrutiny of Hunter Biden, the son of his opponent, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. They’re especially focusing on the younger Biden’s ties to China.
""Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings and influence peddling around the world—including in CHINA!"" Trump tweeted on Oct. 14. His campaign also ran an ad that said, ""The question is not why Hunter Biden used his name to..."
"A Delaware judge took some digs at Elon Musk's legal team during a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday in Twitter's lawsuit to force the billionaire to honor his $44 billion purchase agreement.
Chancery Court Judge Kathleen St. J. McCormick sounded irritated with Musk's team at several points during the hearing.
She told Musk's lawyers that their work to produce and identify people that had spoken with Musk about the deal for court discovery ""bothered [her] a lot."" 
""I ordered you to do the job,"" McCormick said. ""You had two custodians. Have you..."
"“You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You got to be kidding me,” President Trump shot back at Joe Biden in the final presidential debate Thursday. The former vice president had told the president that a now-infamous story in the New York Post — sourced from leaked emails and accusing Biden of corruption in Ukraine — was “a Russian plant.”
Who is right? And how should the nation handle this leak and potential foreign interference at a critical time?
A close look at the evidence shows..."
"President Donald Trump said he has been tested for coronavirus, a precaution taken after he was in physical contact with people who have since tested positive for the virus.
During a Saturday press conference, Trump said he was tested on Friday after pressure from the media and others who said he should.
Despite days of White House denials that he didn’t need to be tested because he wasn’t exposed for long periods of time — including in a memo from his physician — it seems either Trump or his medical..."
"Republicans love “states’ rights,” until they don’t. Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, America’s most racist Keebler, is expected to use his speech to the California Peace Officers Association today to formally announce the Trump administration’s pending lawsuit against the state of California and several state leaders over a series of pro-immigrant bills designed to limit cooperation with Donald Trump’s racist, mass deportation force:"
"The Justice Department on Thursday accused Yale University of illegally discriminating against Asian American and white students in admissions, a major escalation of the administration's attacks on affirmative action.
If Yale does not change its admissions policy, ""the Department will be prepared to file a lawsuit,"" according to a letter from Eric Dreiband, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
Yale said the school was dismayed by the allegation and called the government's conclusion hasty and meritless.
After receiving complaints from Asian American students, the Justice Department two years ago launched..."
"Consumer prices rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, according to data released Thursday. The report was better than expected and surprised investors, with markets surging on the news. But the Federal Reserve still has far to go in its battle to tame inflation.
The Consumer Price Index, which measures the changes in prices for a variety of consumer goods and services, was lower than the 8.2% reading in September.
“Today’s CPI report shows inflation is moving in the right direction,” said Eric Merlis, managing director, co-head of global markets at..."
"President Donald Trump’s push for bigger $2,000 COVID-19 relief checks stalled out in the Senate as Republicans blocked a swift vote proposed by Democrats and split within their own ranks over whether to boost spending or defy the White House.
The roadblock mounted Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may not be sustainable as pressure mounts. Trump wants the Republican-led chamber to follow the House and increase the checks from $600 for millions of Americans. A growing number of Republicans, including two senators in runoff elections on Jan. 5..."
"Things are going to drag on in the Senate for a few days.
Bottom line: There is absolutely no sign right now that a standalone bill on $2,000 checks is going to get a vote on the Senate floor. It looks like McConnell is simply going to run out the clock. There were several opportunities on Tuesday when McConnell could have made that assurance or let Democrats pass the bill with a unanimous consent agreement that would have shielded his members from having to take a potentially tough vote.
McConnell..."
"President Barack Obama announced Thursday that the United States has canceled joint military training exercises with the Egyptian military and alluded to the fact that his administration could take further steps to deal with the violence in Egypt.
""Going forward, I've asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim government and further steps we may take as necessary with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship,"" Obama said.
In a statement from his vacation home on Martha's Vineyard, the president, however, refrained..."
"President Barack Obama spoke out on the crisis in Egypt on Thursday, saying he's ""concerned"" by recent events.
""The United States strongly condemns the steps that have been taken by Egypt's interim government and security forces,"" Obama said. ""We deplore violence against civilians.""
""Today, the United States extends its condolences to the families of those who were killed and those who were wounded,"" Obama continued.""
Obama announced that the U.S. is cancelling a bi-annual joint military exercise with Egypt that was to take place in September, but he did not..."
"Amazon appears to have halted the sale of a book accused of attacking transgender people, outraging some prominent conservatives.
Ryan T Anderson, a former fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said on Sunday that the online retail giant had removed his 2018 bookWhen Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment from its store.
“Given the aggressive push on trans policies coming from the Biden admin, now is a great time to read it,” he said in a tweet on Sunday. “Buy it before you no longer can.”

"The city that never sleeps is ready for a great awakening.
After enduring more than 13 months of a global pandemic that ravaged the Big Apple, New York is taking a major step toward a return to normal with mask mandates and restrictions on businesses being lifted.
Gov. Cuomo offered a celebratory pat on the back Wednesday, marking the “milestone” as a majority of the state’s COVID capacity limits are officially eased and vaccinated New Yorkers are allowed to ditch their face coverings in most circumstances.
“New York is coming..."
"There is a shift happening in the housing market.
After more than a year of soaring demand, exploding home prices and increasing real estate sales, the market finally seems to be cooling off.
“The housing market isn’t crashing, but it is experiencing a hangover as it comes down from an unsustainable high,” said Taylor Marr, Redfin deputy chief economist.
Mortgage rates have increased more than two and a half percentage points this year. And the higher costs of financing a home have changed the calculations for many would-be homebuyers. As a result,..."
"After months of negotiations, a massive bipartisan infrastructure bill that promises significant investments in every pocket of the country got President Joe Biden's signature on Monday.
""My fellow Americans, today I want you to know we hear you, and we see you. The bill I'm about to sign into law is proof that, despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results,"" Biden said. ""We can deliver real results for real people we see in ways that really matter each and every day to each person out there. And..."
"Joe Biden has formally raised the US cap on refugee admissions to 62,500 this year, weeks after facing bipartisan blowback for his delay in replacing the record-low ceiling set by Donald Trump.
Refugee resettlement agencies have waited for Biden to quadruple the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year since 12 February, when a presidential proposal was submitted to Congress saying he planned to do so."
"The Biden administration said Monday it would allow 62,500 refugees to resettle in the United States this year, reversing course after the White House initially said it would keep a historically low Trump-era limit on those fleeing war, violence and persecution.
President Joe Biden made the announcement weeks after he sparked a political uproar from human rights groups and Democrats in Congress over an earlier plan to limit refugees to 15,000 – a figure set by former President Donald Trump.
""Today, I am revising the United States’ annual..."
"The number of migrant arrivals reported along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2022 surpassed 2 million in August, an all-time high driven in part by unprecedented levels of migration from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, according to government data published Monday.
Migrant encounters along the U.S. southern border rose slightly to 203,598 last month, reversing a downward trend recorded in the previous two months, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show.
The number included 181,160 Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants who entered the U.S. illegally, virtually the same level as in July, as..."
"House Democrats postponed a vote Wednesday on a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus bill in the hopes a deal could be reached as negotiations drag on with the White House on a plan to help Americans struggling from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.
The vote was postponed until Thursday to allow House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and White House negotiators more time to discuss a potential bipartisan deal, said a Democratic aide, who was unable to discuss internal deliberations publicly.
Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met at the..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met Wednesday to discuss an economic-relief deal, and although they did not reach a final deal, House Democrats agreed to postpone a vote on a more partisan bill to give the bipartisan talks more time.
“Secretary Mnuchin and I had an extensive conversation and we found areas where we are seeking further clarification. Our conversations will continue,” Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement after their 90-minute meeting.
Democrats pulled back plans to vote on their $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, which is..."
"Recent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities are a very troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement, but so too is the shocking lack of massive indignation. Given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, we expected more passionate public outrage. What we got was a shrug of meh-rage.
When reading the dark squishy entrails of popular culture, meh-rage in the face of sustained prejudice is an indisputable sign of the coming Apatholypse: apathy to all forms of social..."
"A seeming lack of considerable outrage from Black people over recent high-profile, anti-Semitic controversies stems from the desire to not be accused of ""undermining and undercutting"" the current racial justice movement, journalist Jemele Hill said.
""There are people who give no care about the Jewish culture, who are using DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson and some of the entertainers that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar mentioned as a way to undermine and try to eat at the credibility of the people who are out there fighting for justice,"" Hill, a staff writer at The..."
"The FBI conducted more background checks for firearms purchases in March -- a month in which several prominent mass shootings reignited America's conversation about gun control -- than they have in any month so far this year.
About 4.7 million Americans initiated gun background checks last month -- a 36% increase from February, according to the FBI. More than 2 million of those checks were for new gun purchases, according to the National Shooting Sports Federation, the firearms industry trade group that compares FBI background check numbers with actual sales..."
"Even by the ever-sinking standards of President Trump’s fondness for right-wing conspiracy theories, his latest is something to behold.
On Tuesday, Trump accused the elderly protester who was violently shoved to the ground by Buffalo police last Thursday of staging the incident as an operation for Antifa. The incredible accusation—entirely baseless—defies the reality captured in a widely seen video that has since led to the firing of the two officers who pushed 75-year-old Martin Gugino, causing him to bleed from the head, during a protest against police brutality outside Buffalo’s..."
"The national unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in more than four years in April, according to data released Friday, sending stock markets to new heights and dispelling fears that the recovery had stumbled.
Businesses hired more people than analysts expected, pushing the jobless rate down to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent in March. The Labor Department reported that the economy in April added 165,000 jobs across a broad swath of industries. Just as importantly, the agency significantly increased its estimates of job growth for the previous two months...."
"The stock market continues its winning streak: The Dow Jones hit another milestone today, tapping 15,000 for the first time, but closing just shy of the milestone.
This, of course, follows good news about the job market released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
All of this got The Wall Street Journal thinking: just how long does it take the Dow to climb 1,000 points. They explain:"
"Idaho is facing a pair of lawsuits after its governor signed two of the nation’s harshest anti-transgender bills into law.
On Monday, Republican Gov. Brad Little approved two bills that had been met with widespread opposition. House Bill 500 bans transgender girls from playing on school sports teams in alignment with their gender identity, while House Bill 509 blocks trans people from correcting their birth certificates to match the person they know themselves to be. Forty local and national businesses, including Hewlett-Packard and Verizon, signed onto an open letter opposing..."
"On Saturday Barack Obama celebrated his 60th birthday on Martha’s Vineyard, at his $11.75 million mansion, with family, longtime friends from Hawaii, and boldface names like John Legend, who sang “Happy Birthday” to a tent full of attendees. The party was significantly scaled down from original plans, according to the former president’s office, because of the delta variant of the coronavirus, and occurred outdoors following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol — though social media showed glimpses of a rollicking bash. At one point Obama, wearing white slacks and..."
"On International Women’s Day and throughout Women’s History Month, it’s worth considering and reflecting on the triumph and tragedy of our current state of affairs. As we celebrate the many achievements of women who have broken through to lead and succeed in extraordinary ways, we should also reflect on how far we are from gender parity and commit to doing what it takes to become a more gender equal nation.
There are many successes worth celebrating this year. Top among them is the ascension of America’s first woman vice president..."
"Change comes from challenge — and that is the message organizers of International Women's Day 2021 hope to trumpet Monday.
""A challenged world is an alert world,"" the International Women's Day website says. ""We can all choose to challenge and call out gender bias and inequality.""
Gender parity in government, workplaces, health care, sports and media coverage is achievable through individual change, organizers say. They hope this year’s theme for International Women's Day — #ChooseToChallenge — will inspire individuals to challenge biases, question stereotypes and celebrate the achievements..."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told G7 leaders during a virtual meeting Monday that he wants the war in Ukraine to end by the end of 2022, according to a source familiar with his remarks, as leaders worked to starve Russia of its oil revenues and mitigate the economic fallout of the conflict.
The dual missions -- sustain support for Ukraine while easing economic pressures at home -- have defined this year's summit of leading democracies, held high in the Bavarian Alps. While largely united, the leaders are all facing their own political imperatives to see..."
"Former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer announced Saturday night that he was ending his campaign for the Democratic nomination after a disappointing finish in the South Carolina primary.
“I said if I didn’t see a path to winning that I would suspend my campaign, and honestly, I don’t see a path where I can win the presidency,” Steyer said at an event in Columbia, adding that he would “of course” be supporting the eventual nominee, because they’re all “a million times better than Trump.”"
"As the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about reversing a nearly 50-year precedent on abortion rights, a young woman wearing a “Bans off my body” T-shirt walked up to a white poster in a downtown Jackson hotel ballroom.
Several members and supporters of the Mississippi Abortion Access Coalition had jotted down messages on an array of pink, blue and orange sticky notes — what they would want to say to the justices.
“I remember having to go to Cuba or Sweden for abortion. Not again.”
“Protect Black Women.”
She added the latest in..."
"Court rules 5-4 that authorities can detain immigrants awaiting deportation anytime after they have completed prison terms
The US supreme court on Tuesday endorsed US government authority to detain immigrants awaiting deportation at any time – potentially even years – after they have completed prison terms for criminal convictions, handing Donald Trump a victory as he pursues hardline immigration policies.
The court ruled 5-4, with its conservative justices in the majority and its liberal justices dissenting, that federal authorities could pick up such immigrants and place them into indefinite detention..."
"The suspect in the shooting at the Family Research Council walked into the headquarters of the conservative group armed with a 9mm pistol and shot a security guard, saying ""I don't like your politics,"" authorities alleged in a criminal complaint filed Thursday.
The complaint accuses Floyd Lee Corkins II, 28, of a federal firearms violation and assault with intent to kill.
The council is a Christian group focused on family and anti-abortion issues and religious liberties that recently came out in support of Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy. The..."
"Yesterdays shooting at the conservative Family Research Council in downtown Washington, D.C., is symptomatic of a broader lack of civility in political discourse, the head of an organization promoting traditional marriage said Thursday.
“[The] responsibility is on the shooter but we need to have a civil debate over issues like redefining marriage, said Brian Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, appearing on CNNs Early Start. “But we should not be attacking and labeling as hate groups those [with which] we disagree. We should condemn violence of..."
"In a speech to National Rifle Association members on Friday that was part political rally and part pep talk, President Trump called himself a champion of gun rights. Then he proved it, whipping out a pen onstage to sign a letter that would effectively cease America’s involvement in an arms treaty designed to regulate the international sale of conventional weapons.
Mr. Trump said that his administration “will never” ratify the Arms Trade Treaty, which seeks to discourage the sale of conventional weapons to countries that do not protect human rights...."
"For a second week, the question of whether President Obama loves America continues to be asked of the Republicans with their eye on the White House.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, a frequent Obama critic, answered the query Sunday but declined to criticize former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani for sparking this debate.
“I have no doubt that he loves his country,” Graham, R-S.C., said about Obama on ABC’s This Week. “I"
"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a prospective Republican presidential contender, said Saturday he does not know whether President Obama is a Christian.
“I don’t know,” Walker said in an interview at the JW Marriott hotel in Washington, where he was attending the winter meeting of the National Governors Association."
"Twitter permanently banned an account on Thursday belonging to Project Veritas, a conservative group founded by controversial activist James O'Keefe.
The decision followed what a Twitter (TWTR) spokesperson described to CNN Business as repeated violations of the platform's policies prohibiting sharing — or threats of sharing — other people's private information without consent.
Twitter declined to say what specific tweets may have triggered the enforcement action. But in a post on Project Veritas's public Telegram channel Thursday afternoon, the group said the suspension occurred after it published a video..."
"President Donald Trump's efforts to build his appeal and define his opponent at the Republican National Convention, using pageantry and the White House as the backdrop, had little apparent impact on the electorate's impressions of both him and former Vice President Joe Biden, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds.
Trump's week of celebration did not improve his favorability, even among his own base, and the country still remains widely critical of his handling of the major crisis of his presidency: COVID-19.
Less than one-third (31%) of the country has a..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden have canceled Ohio rallies due to the coronavirus outbreak, their campaigns announced Tuesday.
These are the first campaign events in the 2020 presidential election cycle to be canceled because of the virus.
“We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak,” the Sanders campaign said in a statement about the rally in Cleveland that was scheduled to take place Tuesday night. “Sen. Sanders would like to..."
"The novel coronavirus prompted both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden to cancel their election-night rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday evening. The two candidates are going head-to-head in six states, including Ohio, on Tuesday, but they won't be celebrating any potential victories with their supporters.
There's seemingly nothing Cleveland-specific about the decisions — it appears both candidates would have reached the same decision regardless of location, and instead acted on advice of Ohio officials who cautioned against hosting large public gatherings, especially indoors, as COVID-19..."
"House Democrats pushed through a $2.2 trillion stimulus plan on Thursday that would provide aid to families, schools, restaurants, businesses and airline workers, advancing a wish list with little chance of becoming law as negotiations with the Trump administration failed to yield a bipartisan agreement.
Even as Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted there was still room for the talks to produce a deal, the vote reflected the continued failure of Congress and the White House to come together on another pandemic relief package and the dwindling chances that they could do..."
"The House voted Monday to reject President Trump’s veto of a $741 billion defense authorization bill, setting up the first congressional override of his presidency just days before he exits office.
The 322-to-87 vote was comfortably more than the two-thirds of the House that was needed to pass the measure and set up the legislation for a similar override vote in the Senate later this week. But the House’s margin of victory was smaller than the support the same bill received earlier this month, before the president’s veto. Some Republicans..."
"The House voted on Monday to overturn President Trump's veto of the gargantuan annual defense authorization bill.
The vote, 322-87, was a highly unusual response to a highly unusual move by a president in rejecting the legislation, which sets policies and establishes other priorities every year for the military services.
The Senate's next moves on the matter are still uncertain, but senators were set to return to Washington on Tuesday.
The political popularity of the military typically means the National Defense Authorization Act has a high likelihood of passage and..."
"The Justice Department will investigate the policies and operations of the Minneapolis Police Department, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland announced on Wednesday, a day after the former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder in the death of George Floyd in a rare rebuke of police violence.
“The Justice Department has opened a civil investigation to determine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing,” Mr. Garland said in brief remarks at the Justice Department.
Such investigations are often the precursors to..."
"Migrants who were flown from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, under a new program by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sued DeSantis, a Republican, and other state officials Tuesday, alleging they were victims of fraud for political purposes.
Alianza Americas, a Chicago-based network of migrant-led organizations, and three migrants who landed in Massachusetts last week on flights chartered by Florida accused DeSantis and his co-defendants of executing “a premeditated, fraudulent, and illegal scheme ... for the sole purpose of advancing their own personal, financial and political interests.”
In the lawsuit, which seeks..."
"Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said “yes,” she believes the 2016 Democratic nomination for president was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton, and that the party faces “a real problem” in dealing with the fallout from the revelation that Clinton’s campaign secretly took over control of the Democratic National Committee in 2015."
"The United States will announce retaliatory action against France in response to the country’s new tax affecting American technology companies, President Donald Trump said Friday.
He suggested he could target French wine with tariffs — a move experts considered the most likely U.S. response to the French digital services tax.
“I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine!” Trump tweeted."
"On Friday, a federal judge in Texas blocked an Obama-era program protecting undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children from deportation, halting the program’s ability to accept new applicants and once again throwing the lives of more than 600,000 people into tumult.
In his 77-page opinion, district court Judge Andrew Hanen concluded that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, is unlawful because it violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs federal rulemaking, by evading the normal “notice and comment” process in adopting new rules.
Hanen’s decision doesn’t immediately..."
"Investigators were reviewing a range of possible terror links to a gunman who opened fire at a crowded Orlando nightclub early Sunday, leaving at least 50 dead and 53 others wounded.
A federal law enforcement official identified the attacker as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Fla.

"The Kim Davis situation raises interesting questions about the meaning and practical effect of the freedom of religion. Although, for reasons that I will explain, the issue today is one of public policy, rather than constitutional law, the evolution of constitutional principles in this realm is illuminating."
"The Biden administration on Thursday announced tough new sanctions on Russia and formally blamed the country’s premier intelligence agency for the sophisticated hacking operation that breached American government agencies and the nation’s largest companies.
In the broadest effort yet to give more teeth to financial sanctions — which in the past have failed to deter Russian activity — the actions are aimed at choking off lending to the Russian government.
In an executive order, President Biden announced a series of additional steps — sanctions on 32 entities and individuals for..."
"Applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance dipped below 400,000 for the first time during the pandemic as hiring accelerates and the economy strengthens heading into the summer months.
Initial claims in regular state programs decreased by 20,000 to 385,000 in the week ended May 29, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 387,000 applications. The prior week’s reading was revised down to 405,000.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Iranian hackers targeted President Trump’s re-election campaign, two people with knowledge of the attacks said on Friday, in a sign of how cyberattacks could become a fixture of the 2020 presidential election.
Microsoft said in a report earlier Friday that hackers, with apparent backing from Iran’s government, had made more than 2,700 attempts to identify the email accounts of current and former United States government officials, journalists covering political campaigns and accounts associated with a presidential campaign.
It was not clear what information — if any —..."
"Democrats outperformed history and expectations with a surprisingly strong midterm elections performance Tuesday, with the promised red wave nowhere to be found.
The best news for the GOP is that they appear to be the favorites to narrowly retake the House of Representatives, though the outcomes of key races have not yet been called. Apart from that, the results so far are a litany of disappointments for Republicans.
In the Senate, the contests that will determine control — Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona — have not yet been called. But Democrats..."
"The cute little Twitter bird has teeth. Today, the company announced it has poisoned the local watering hole, hoping it will stall Elon Musk as he seeks to swallow up the social media company in a hostile takeover.
The company board voted unanimously Friday to create a new “Rights Plan” that allows shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount should some party like, for instance, a relatively unknown internet troll named Elon Musk, decide to buy up 15% or more of the company shares. Musk currently owns around 9% of..."

"After years of using Twitter as a legislation tool, sounding board and occasional diary, President Donald Trump was permanently banned from the platform on Friday.
Less than two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, the social media company removed the commander in chief after rioters overtook the Capitol on Wednesday, leading to the deaths of at least five people.
In a blog post about the permanent suspension, Twitter said they did so “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”
“In the context of horrific events this..."
"Amid ever-rising coronavirus cases, and a bitter and corrosive political climate, what better time for the inspiring Christmas message of the Most Rev. Michael Curry, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church? “The story of a baby born is the story of beauty, a story of hope,” he wrote, “whereas the Jewish tradition says every child who is born is a reminder that God is not finished with the world yet.”
Noting the accounts of tyranny and hatred arising from King Herod’s fear of a coming rival to his throne, Curry found an expression..."
"Former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin's trial began Monday morning. Chauvin faces three charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of George Floyd.
Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, a white 19-year veteran of the department, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes.
The nearly nine-minute video of Floyd's death, in which he can repeatedly be heard saying, ""I can't breathe,"" led to global protests last year against police brutality."
"The video of George Floyd gasping for breath was front and center Monday as the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on the Black man’s neck went on trial Monday on charges of murder and manslaughter.
Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell showed the jurors the footage at the earliest opportunity, during opening statements, after telling them that the number to remember was 9 minutes, 29 seconds — the amount of time officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the pavement last May."
"The first courtroom test for Special Counsel John Durham ended in defeat Tuesday as a federal jury found a Democratic attorney not guilty of making a false statement to the FBI about allegations of computer links between Donald Trump and Russia.
The jury deliberated for about six hours before acquitting Michael Sussmann, 57, on the single felony charge he faced: that he lied when he allegedly denied he was acting on behalf of any client in alerting the FBI to claims that a secret server linked Trump and a Moscow..."
"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's internal watchdog plans to review a recent Army Corps of Engineers decision to award a $400 million contract for border wall construction to a North Dakota company that has been publicly and privately endorsed by members of the Trump administration, including the president himself.
The review of the award to Fisher Sand & Gravel is an audit by the Pentagon's inspector general and comes in response to a request by Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security...."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department’s internal watchdog is investigating a $400 million border wall contract awarded to a firm that used multiple appearances on Fox News to push for the job.
The Pentagon’s inspector general sent a letter Thursday to House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson telling him the contract awarded to North Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. would be audited. Thompson, D-Miss., asked for the review last week, in part over concerns the proposals did not meet operational requirements and prototypes came in late and over..."
"The House passed a resolution on Thursday approving procedures for its impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, opening a new and public phase of the investigation.
The vote, 232 to 196, was largely along party lines and Republicans objected, alleging that the Democratic inquiry is a farce that has been improperly conducted behind closed doors. House Democrats are now expected to begin holding public hearings in the next few weeks to present testimony against Trump."
"It’s not over just yet.
Dr. Anthony Fauci says the U.S. won’t emerge from the COVID pandemic until next spring at the earliest.
The world-renowned infectious disease expert predicted the coming months will remain very difficult, with high caseloads and deaths especially in places with low vaccination rates.
“If we can get through this winter ... I hope we can get some good control in the spring of 2022,” Fauci told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday night.
Fauci said it will be impossible to get a grip on the pandemic until..."
"Israeli ground forces carried out attacks on the Gaza Strip early Friday in an escalation of a conflict with Palestinian militants that had been waged by airstrikes from Israel and rockets from Gaza.
It was not immediately clear if the attack was the prelude to a ground invasion against Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza.
An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, initially said that “there are ground troops attacking in Gaza,” but later clarified that Israeli troops had not entered Gaza, suggesting the possibility of artillery..."
"President Obama came out strongly Monday for the concept of net neutrality, saying that ""an open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life.""
In a written statement, Obama asked the Federal Communications Commission to ""create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality,"" and to ensure that phone and cable companies will not be able ""to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online.""
The FCC is nearing a decision.
Net neutrality supporters hailed the president's comments as..."
"Two civilians and one police officer died after a gunman opened fire at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood, leading to a five-hour stand-off with law enforcement.

The gunman is in police custody after surrendering just before 5 p.m. local time, police spokesper"
"Police were trying to determine Saturday why a middle-aged gunman in hunting gear allegedly went on a wild shooting spree inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, killing three people, including a police officer.
The suspect, identified as Robert Lewis Dear, 57, of Hartsel, Colo., surrendered to officers after a five-hour ordeal Friday in which he fired randomly at people in the clinic and roamed the halls shooting through walls with an assault-style rifle.

"How are news organizations not wise to this scam?
That’s the reaction I had when I heard that ABC News had suspended reporter David Wright after Wright got secretly recorded by Project Veritas, the group run by conservative con artist James O’Keefe. Their goal is to “expose” media they see as biased and liberals they don’t like, which they usually do by recording people without their knowledge, then deceptively editing their comments and releasing them as an “exposé.”
I’ll explain a bit about that history and how it relates to..."
"It’s been a rough month for the crypto world, which has faced market crashes, layoffs, lawsuits from regulators and rising rhetorical pushback from critics. But on June 7, two U.S. senators introduced a bipartisan bill that, if passed, could clear the way for increased crypto adoption and growth.
The Responsible Financial Innovation Act, proposed by the New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand and the Wyoming Republican Cynthia Lummis, aims to “take a light regulatory touch,” Sen. Lummis said at the DC Blockchain Summit last month. Lummis hopes it will foster innovation while putting up just enough consumer guardrails...."
"Silly season is over. Racist season is here. Silly season is when nothing is going on in the presidential campaign and the debate focuses on trivialities. Racist season is when the presidential campaign begins in earnest and President Barack Obama looks vulnerable. Then, liberal commentators pull out all the stops to deem practically any criticism of the president racist."
"A new executive order from President Joe Biden directs federal agencies to take a series of steps to promote voting access, a move that comes as congressional Democrats press for a sweeping voting and elections bill to counter efforts to restrict voting access.
His plan was announced during a recorded address on the 56th commemoration of “Bloody Sunday,” the 1965 incident in which some 600 civil rights activists were viciously beaten by state troopers as they tried to march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.

"Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek apologized to employees at the company for the company’s handling of Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill and said that it would be pausing political donations in the state. Chapek also said that the company will be “increasing our support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states.”
“Thank you to all who have reached out to me sharing your pain, frustration and sadness over the company’s response to the Florida ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill,” Chapek wrote in the memo. “Speaking to you, reading..."
"Of all the endlessly competing theories for the shocking outcome of the 2016 presidential election, two have always struck me as the most credible. The first is that general overconfidence in a Clinton victory led her campaign to make a series of strategic errors (e.g, putting resources into states like Arizona and Georgia while shirking the “Clinton firewall” states that eventually swung the electoral college to Donald Trump) while convincing many of her potential voters that it was safe to stay home on Election Day. The second is that James..."
"Migrants seeking to enter the United States will again have to stay in Mexico as they await immigration hearings, as the Biden administration reluctantly announced plans Thursday to reinstate the Trump-era policy and agreed to Mexico’s conditions for resuming it.
Revival of the “Remain in Mexico” policy comes even as the Biden administration maneuvers to end it in a way that survives legal scrutiny. President Joe Biden scrapped the policy, but a lawsuit by Texas and Missouri forced him to put it back into effect, subject to Mexico’s acceptance.
Mexico’s..."
"After much delay, senators unveiled a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, wrapping up days of painstaking work on the inches-thick bill and launching what is certain to be a lengthy debate over President Joe Biden’s big priority.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act clocked in at some 2,700 pages, and senators could begin amending it soon. Despite the hurry-up-and-wait during a rare weekend session, emotions bubbled over once the bill was produced Sunday night. The final product was not intended to stray from the broad outline senators had negotiated for..."
"Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Sunday, arguing that his comments about Clinton playing the ""women's card"" aren’t hurting him with female voters.
""I'm my own strategist, and I like what I said, and it's true. I only tell the truth, and that's why people vote for me,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Even women don't like her. They don't like her. But it is the women's card, and she plays it, and I'll let you know in about six months whether..."
"Hillary Clinton on Friday brushed off Donald Trump's sometimes personal attacks against her as him being ""off the reservation"" -- something she said she has experience with.
""I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak,"" Clinton said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, which first aired on ""The Lead."" The Democratic presidential front-runner did not elaborate which men she was referring to.
Tapper questioned Clinton about Trump's series of attacks on her, including..."
"The Supreme Court seemed unlikely Monday to be heading for a major ruling on Second Amendment rights after hearing courtroom arguments in a dispute over a New York City gun restriction — a law no longer on the books.
Because New York repealed the law after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, the city argued that the case should be dismissed as moot because there's nothing left to fight over. Based on the comments by the justices Monday, it did not seem that a majority was willing to..."
"The Vatican said Monday that the Catholic Church would not bless same-sex unions, in a statement approved by Pope Francis that threatens to widen the chasm between the church and much of the LGBTQ community.
Explaining their decision in a lengthy note on Monday, the Holy See referred to homosexuality as a ""choice,"" suggested it is sinful and said it ""cannot be recognized as objectively ordered"" to God's plans; a combative stance that is certain to disappoint millions of gay and lesbian Catholics around the world.

It's a result that will force the leader to work with at least one opposition party to govern.
As of 1:30 a.m. ET Tuesday, Trudeau’s Liberal Party had won 157 of 338 seats, according to preliminary results from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, ensuring that Trudeau will remain the prime minister of Canada. The Conservative Party, led by..."
"Obama’s reelection prospects are bound up in the hope that he can convince people he actually is digging the country out of a hole, which means keeping the attention on those efforts and how deep the hole was. For Romney, with polls that consistently show him climbing when the focus is on the election but dipping when it goes elsewhere, the political path through November is clear. The president needs people seeing photos of the gay couples gathering at Chick-fil-A franchises for Friday night's planned “kiss-in” about as much as..."
"Wednesday marked Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. Across the United States, conservatives gathered in chicken restaurants to show support for the company after its president, Dan Cathy, came out against gay marriage. Democratic mayors in Chicago and Boston at first threatened to halt expansion of the Chick-fil-A chain to their cities, which turned a question of sexual morality into a debate about freedom of speech. The motto of conservative Christians seems to be, ""They'll take my chicken from my cold dead hand..."""
"Russian troops have occupied Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, where a fire that had threatened potential disaster was extinguished in the early hours of Friday morning, according to Ukraine's nuclear regulator.
In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.
The power plant's six reactors remain intact, though the compartment auxiliary buildings for reactor unit 1 had been damaged, the SNRI said in its..."
"Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington, has announced he is running for president, declaring himself the “only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation’s number one priority”.
A vocal advocate for taking action on climate change, Inslee used his entrance into the race to sound the alarm on what he called “the most urgent challenge of our time”.
“We’re the first generation to feel the sting of climate change,” he said in a video announcing his launch. “And we’re the last who can do something about it.”..."
"Ukraine wants warplanes. Its allies have plenty. But getting fighter jets to Ukraine is much more complicated than it might seem.
On Wednesday, the Biden administration rejected a proposal from Poland that would have made its old Russian-made MiG fighters available to a U.S. base in Germany for potential handover to Ukraine, because it would be a “high risk” step that could ratchet up tensions with Russia, the Defense Department said.
The difficulties are legal, logistical and political. Top leaders of NATO — the alliance of 30 countries that includes the U.S. and Germany — want to help..."
"DES MOINES — Hours before Beto O'Rourke quit the presidential race Friday evening, his supporters were taking part in the boisterous ""sign wars"" here outside the Wells Fargo Arena ahead of the season's biggest Democratic gathering.
In New Hampshire, his campaign was building out an upcoming trip, announcing he would participate in the famed ""Politics and Eggs"" speaking series on Nov. 8.
And in El Paso, staffers were readying a policy on disability issues to coincide with a forum on the topic Saturday in Cedar Rapids.
In many ways, it..."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized booster doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people 65 and older and those whose jobs put them at high risk for exposure to COVID-19.
Individuals 18 and up who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 were also included in the authorization, which only covers those who are at least six months out from their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
High-risk jobs include ""health care workers, teachers and day care staff, grocery workers and those in homeless shelters or prisons, among others,” said acting FDA Commissioner..."
"We all know by now that Ted Cruz went on vacation while Texas froze.
Over the last week, millions of Texans have suffered in the cold as workers tried to restore power amid freezing temperatures and icy conditions. So far, the official local death toll from the snow, ice and power outages stands at 24.
Rather than stay behind and help coordinate aid and federal assistance, the state’s junior senator went to Cancún, if only for a day, before widespread outrage brought him back to the United States.

"Friday night was a long one for President Biden, working the phones at the end of a week where his party lost a bellwether race in Virginia, following months of Democratic infighting over his agenda. Down in the polls, he had just returned from an overseas trip where he said he faced questions about whether he had support to back the pledges he made on the world stage.
But by Saturday morning, Biden could not contain his ebullience, celebrating a major legislative victory: a long-stalled $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill had passed with..."
"He has been here before.
President Joe Biden doesn’t need to look any further back than his time as vice president to grasp the challenges that lie ahead in promoting his new $1 trillion infrastructure deal to the American people and getting the money out the door fast enough that they can feel a real impact.
When President Barack Obama pushed through a giant stimulus bill in 2009, his administration faced criticism that the money was too slow to work its way into the sluggish economy, and Obama later acknowledged that he..."
"DENVER — After scraping by for weeks on unemployment checks and peanut butter sandwiches, Jake Lyon recently received the call that many who temporarily lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic have anticipated: The college-town tea shop where he worked was reopening, and it was time to go back.
But Mr. Lyon, 23, and his co-workers in Fort Collins, Colo., who were temporarily laid off, worried about contracting the virus, so they asked the shop’s owners to delay reopening and meet with them to discuss safety measures. The reluctance..."
"More than two dozen U.S. cities claim to the be the “birthplace of Memorial Day.""
In July of 1866, a New York newspaper reported on a “grand gathering” of Union veterans in Salem, Ill. Gen. John A. Logan, head of the fraternal group the Grand Army of the Republic, made a speech, railing against the defeated Confederates and urging rights and protections for freed slaves.
He also angrily noted that “traitors in the South have their gatherings, day after day, to strew garlands of flowers upon the graves of Rebel..."
"Two senior U.S. vaccine regulators who are leaving the FDA came out against giving Covid-19 booster shots to the general population now in a research paper published Monday that concludes current science on vaccine efficacy doesn't support giving third shots to most Americans.
The paper, co-authored by Marion Gruber and Philip Krause and published in The Lancet, deals a blow to the FDA and to the Biden administration just days before an external agency panel is set to review the case for doling out Pfizer-BioNTech boosters. The scientists recently announced plans to retire..."
"High-ranking Iranian nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who, Israel alleged, led the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear programme until its disbanding in the early 2000s has been “assassinated” in an ambush near Tehran.
Fakhrizadeh was shot and injured “by terrorists” in his vehicle in Absard, a suburb in eastern Tehran, and later succumbed to his injuries in what amounted to a “martyr’s death,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday."
"The House voted Wednesday to authorize a lawsuit against President Obama, claiming that he has overstepped the limits of his executive authority.
The vote to allow Speaker John Boehner to sue Obama was 225 to 201. Five Republicans voted no, while no Democrats voted in favor of pursuing the lawsuit.
Republicans say that Obama exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally deciding to delay the employer mandate for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act."
"The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to sue President Obama for overstepping the powers of the presidency — a move that has angered conservatives who call it insufficient, emboldened Democrats who say Republicans are being vengeful, and further eroded much of what is left of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill.
In a 225-to-201 party-line vote, Republicans authorized the House to move forward with a lawsuit against Mr. Obama for his application of the Affordable Care Act, which they argue has been selective and intended to delay the law’s most undesirable..."

"Employers added 428,000 jobs in April, extending a streak of booming payroll gains despite a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, persistent worker shortages and the war in Ukraine.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.6%, the Labor Department said Friday.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that 390,000 jobs were added last month.
The nation has recouped 20.8 million, or 95%, of the 22 million jobs lost early in the health crisis, leaving it 1.2 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level. The deficit could be closed by summer.
Job growth averaged more than half a..."
"A man who pleaded guilty to breaching the Senate chamber during the US Capitol insurrection was sentenced Monday to eight months in prison in a closely watched case that could influence how hundreds of other rioters charged with the same felony are punished.
Paul Hodgkins, a 38-year-old Floridian, is now the first Capitol rioter convicted of a felony to be sentenced. He pleaded guilty last month to obstructing congressional proceedings -- specifically, the counting of the electoral votes, which he helped delay on January 6. He spent about 15 minutes inside the..."
"In December, the last Obamacare enrollment period under the Trump administration closed. Now that the Biden administration has arrived, it’s trying a do-over.
The renewed effort reflects the Biden team’s view that the Trump administration did too little to help people find coverage, despite a public health crisis and waves of job losses. Although insurance sign-ups were up a bit compared with last year, the growth did not match the increase in need.
In an executive order he signed Thursday, President Biden created a 90-day enrollment period starting Feb. 15..."
"President Joe Biden on Thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some of the policies of former President Donald Trump, including directing that people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on abortion and family planning services.
Biden signed an executive order for the Department of Health and Human Services to reopen insurance enrollment on HealthCare.gov from Feb. 15 through May 15, giving a new coverage opportunity to Americans who lost their jobs and employer-based insurance during the pandemic...."
"The president of the AFL-CIO union federation told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on Sunday that the Trump administration has “done more things to hurt workers” than to help them.
Richard Trumka, head of the group that includes 55 different unions, said wages are being swamped by rising health care and housing costs, and that President Donald Trump is botching his trade war with China.
Trump has also opposed every effort to increase the minimum wage and has stripped safety standards that used to protect workers, Trumka said.
“I’ve tried to..."
"Russia’s military said Tuesday it would “fundamentally” cut back operations near Ukraine’s capital and a northern city, as talks brought a possible deal to end a grinding and brutal war into view.
Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the move was meant to increase trust in the talks after several rounds of failed negotiations to halt the conflict that has devolved into a bloody campaign of attrition.
Fomin said Moscow had decided to “fundamentally ... cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv” to “increase mutual trust and..."
"Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul said Tuesday they offered a peace proposal to their Russian counterparts that would provide Kyiv security guarantees from international partners, including the United States and Turkey, in exchange for Ukraine’s military neutrality, including a pledge not to host foreign bases or forces.
The Ukrainian delegation, speaking after five hours of talks in Istanbul brokered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government, announced no major breakthrough in the latest round of negotiations with Russia. But Moscow’s lead negotiator called the discussions “substantive,” and Turkey’s foreign minister asserted that..."
"Colin Powell, who died Monday due to complications related to Covid-19, commanded respect from Washington elites and the broader public across the political spectrum — an extraordinary feat that stemmed from his reputation for discipline and fairness. The Harlem, New York-born son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell became a four-star general and the first Black secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Unfortunately, Powell marshaled that reputation and power in service of a terrible misdeed: making the Bush administration’s most powerful case for the Iraq War. Powell went on..."
"Three years ago, the Supreme Court handed an Asian rock band named the Slants an unimaginable win when it proclaimed, in Matal v. Tam, that it was unconstitutional for the law to ban trademarks that were “disparaging.” In celebrating the band’s victory, the lead singer Simon Tam declared the case “a win for all marginalized groups,” asserting: “It can’t be a win for free speech if some people benefit and others don’t.”
Despite his optimism for free speech, Mr. Tam could not have been more wrong about the meaning of..."

"Senator Rand Paul attempted to rebut recent criticism of his stance on national security issues on Sunday, telling attendees of a Republican fundraiser in Tennessee that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and GOP Representative Peter King of New York were depleting the government's coffers by asking for federal disaster relief."
"In some liberal states, masks are coming off -- but not everyone is ready.
Governors in New Jersey, California, Delaware, Connecticut and Oregon have all said that they are lifting masking requirements in some indoor settings. All but California have set deadlines to end required masking in schools. The governors pointed to Covid-19 case rates that have fallen precipitously after Omicron's peak, the hospitalization rates that have stabilized or high vaccination rates in their states.
But the Biden administration still recommends masking indoors -- a position that has long put it in conflict with some Republican-led..."
"This year's Pride Month is starting with a Lego set.
Pride Month is celebrated every year in honour of the Stonewall Inn riots that took place in June 1969, as well as the yearly demonstrations that followed in various cities across the U.S. and eventually the world. Pride reminds us of the violence endured, the progress made, and the hardships yet to come.
Today – the beginning of Pride Month in Canada – Lego is releasing a 346-piece LGBTQ+ themed set titled Everyone is Awesome, a clear nod to the massively popular song written for the..."
"Tuesday marks the beginning of Pride Month 2021 — a time of much-deserved celebration, especially after so many of last year’s festivities were relegated to virtual spaces. And it’s also a time to further the movement for LGBTQ rights. This year, that work is particularly important — because we’re in the midst of an unprecedented effort from Republican-run state legislatures to subjugate the transgender community.
Across 33 states, more than 100 anti-transgender bills have been introduced just in the first few months of 2021. Restrictions proposed within these bills include stopping transgender..."
"A shipment of 35 tons of baby formula has arrived Sunday in Indianapolis on a US military aircraft from Germany to address a nationwide shortage.
The prescription formula will be distributed to areas around the country where there is the most acute need, a Biden administration official earlier told CNN. But the official said none of the first shipment would land on store shelves in the US, adding that Sunday's shipment is hypoallergenic and will be fed to babies intolerant of protein in cow milk."
"Gov. Greg Abbott, who is seeking a third term, and Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat trying to unseat him in November, faced off on Friday night in their only scheduled debate and sparred over the major issues in the race, from immigration to gun policies to the reliability of Texas’ power grid since a February 2021 winter storm left millions without power or heat for days.
Throughout the debate — held in the empty auditorium on the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley campus in Edinburg — Abbott and O’Rourke frequently accused..."
"The budget officially released by the White House on Friday hinges on an optimistic projection that the economy will grow at a rapid pace for the next two years, with inflation under control and unemployment falling to near pre-pandemic levels.
In its first budget, the Biden administration said the economy will grow at just north of 5 percent this year as the nation rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. The White House anticipates robust growth continuing through the following year as well, with the economy expanding by 4.3 percent in 2022. The economy..."
"Hillary Clinton lambasted Bernie Sanders in a forthcoming documentary as a “career politician” who “nobody likes,” savaging her rival for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination less than two weeks before the 2020 Iowa caucuses.
“He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done,” Clinton said in the four-part series “Hillary,” which is set to debut in March and chronicle her life and most recent White House bid."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Clinton says “nobody likes” her former presidential rival Bernie Sanders, even as the Vermont senator remains entrenched among the front-runners in the Democratic race, with the Iowa caucus beginning in less than two weeks.
In an interview with “The Hollywood Reporter” published Tuesday, Clinton was asked about a comment she makes in an upcoming documentary where she says Sanders was “in Congress for years” but, “Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done.”
Clinton replied that the criticism still holds and..."
"President Donald Trump will participate in a town hall with NBC News on Thursday night, setting up a competing television event with Joe Biden in lieu of a presidential debate in which voters would have seen both presidential candidates engage with each other and discuss issues head-to-head.
Biden is set to appear in an ABC town hall, and both events are scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. The two were originally scheduled to participate in a second debate, but the event was eventually canceled after Trump objected to the virtual format..."
"Their face-to-face debate canceled, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will instead hold dueling town halls Thursday on competing television networks.
NBC announced Wednesday it will host a Trump town hall at 8 p.m. EDT on Thursday – the same time at which ABC will be hosting a similar event with Biden in Philadelphia.
The Trump event will be in Miami, which was supposed to be the site of a second debate between the two candidates. That showdown was canceled after Trump refused to participate once it was..."
"Former president Donald Trump’s blog, celebrated by advisers as a “beacon of freedom” that would keep him relevant in an online world he once dominated, is dead. It was 29 days old.
Upset by reports from The Washington Post and other outlets highlighting its measly readership and concerns that it could detract from a social media platform he wants to launch later this year, Trump ordered his team Tuesday to put the blog out of its misery, advisers said.
On its last day, the site received just 1,500 shares or..."

"An idea from progressive Catholic theology might be useful for our times: pater patitur — the father suffers. It goes like this: A father figure, divine or otherwise, isn’t meant to relieve our suffering. Nor should he suffer for us, which suggests condescension. And he certainly shouldn’t inflict suffering on us, as too many parents do with their children. Rather, the father’s role is to suffer with us. We’ve seen this gracious and ultimately progressive model of fatherhood from Joe Biden in recent days in his run for the Democratic..."
"So here’s what I think happened with the Democratic presidential nomination contest this year, at least so far. It’s still not entirely certain that Joe Biden will win, but I think Nate Cohn is right that the situation looks very difficult indeed for Bernie Sanders.
To begin with, I think Seth Masket is correct that this was a case of the party choosing, rather than the party jumping on a bandwagon established by voters. Here's how I would interpret the interaction between Democratic voters and party actors in February:"
"WASHINGTON – The Justice Department will not bring federal charges against a New York City police officer over the death of Eric Garner during a chaotic arrest that ignited nationwide protests five years ago.
The decision, announced Tuesday by Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue, marks the end of a civil rights probe into an episode – much of it captured on video – that helped turn a national spotlight on how police officers use force against minorities.
“Like many of you, I have watched that video many times, and..."
"The Justice Department on Monday declined to file federal civil rights charges against the NYPD officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, whose dying words “I can’t breathe” on July 17, 2014, became a national rallying cry for demonstrations about police treatment of minorities, according to a source familiar with the matter."
"Several hours before polls opened on Tuesday for Election Day in Florida, former President Donald J. Trump warned the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, against mounting a challenge to Mr. Trump’s own anticipated presidential candidacy in the 2024 election cycle.
“If he runs, he runs,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. DeSantis to a handful of reporters traveling with him on his private plane — recently refurbished and put back into use — after a rally Monday night in Dayton, Ohio.
But Mr. Trump added, in remarks published on Tuesday by The..."
"Her “dead broke” comment will be forgotten. What’s more problematic are questions about her honesty. - It’s not the empathy, it’s the honesty. Hillary Clinton told Diane Sawyer that she and her husband were “dead broke” when they left the White House. The remark caused something between a flap and a stir. It might even have qualified as a ruckus. The Republican National Committee said it showed that Clinton was “out of touch” (the go-to charge in the age of the Great Recession and its aftermath). The next day, Good..."
"Despite sarin attack, getting U.S. involved in civil war is not in our interests. As horrific as the death count is from the sarin-filled bombs that the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad allegedly hurled into a rebel stronghold on the edge of Damascus, it should not trigger a U.S. military intervention into Syria's two-and-a-half-year-old civil war."

"An “exasperated” President Obama on Wednesday canceled part of his upcoming trip to Asia and invited congressional leaders to the White House to discuss the budget standoff that has shut down parts of the federal government for the first time in 17 years.
According to a White House official, the top four leaders of both parties from both houses were invited to meet with Obama at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time. The president will urge the House to pass a “clean” continuing resolution — without what Obama has called “ideological demands”..."
"Six weeks after Election Day, with his hold on power slipping, President Donald J. Trump directed his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to make a remarkable call. Mr. Trump wanted him to ask the Department of Homeland Security if it could legally take control of voting machines in key swing states, three people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Giuliani did so, calling the department’s acting deputy secretary, who said he lacked the authority to audit or impound the machines.
Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Giuliani to make that inquiry after rejecting..."
"In his first rally since his home was searched by the F.B.I. on Aug. 8, former President Donald J. Trump on Saturday lashed out at President Biden and federal agents, calling his Democratic rival “an enemy of the state” and the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice “vicious monsters.”
In an aggrieved and combative speech in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump stoked anger against law enforcement even as the F.B.I. and federal officials have faced an increase in threats following the search of Mr. Trump’s residence to retrieve classified documents.

"A career budget official undercut one of the White House's arguments for freezing $400 million in security aid to Ukraine, according to a newly released transcript.
Mark Sandy, a career official in the Office of Management and Budget, said that the White House did not tell his office that the aid was being frozen over concerns about other countries' contributions until months after the hold was put in place. Sandy described deep dissatisfaction within the OMB after the hold was put in place, including questions being raised about the legality..."
"Iran’s top diplomat said Thursday that any attack on his country over a drone-and-missile strike on Saudi Arabia’s oil industry will result in “all-out war,” further pushing up tensions across the Persian Gulf.
The comments by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif represented the starkest warning yet by Iran in a long summer of mysterious attacks and incidents following the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, more than a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the accord.
Zarif’s comments also appeared to be a..."
"Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif threatened that an “all-out war” would result from a military strike on Iran by the United States or Saudi Arabia in response to last weekend’s attacks on Saudi oil facilities.
“I make a very serious statement about defending our country. I’m making a very serious statement that we don’t want war,” Zarif told CNN in an interview that aired Thursday.
“We don’t want to engage in a military confrontation,” he continued. “We believe that a military confrontation based on deception is awful, will have a..."
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday that the company will let users opt out of political ads and will help register 4 million voters for the 2020 election.
Zuckerberg made the announcement in an opinion piece for USA Today, in which he also discussed Facebook's efforts to prevent election interference.
His comments come amid concerns about voter suppression and voting issues during this year's election, which could be amplified by the coronavirus pandemic.
Facebook has ""a responsibility not just to prevent voter suppression — which disproportionately targets people of color..."
"I believe Facebook can strengthen democracy by maintaining as open a platform as possible, accompanied by ambitious efforts to lift voter participation.
The 2020 election is going to be unlike any other. It was already going to be a heated campaign, and that was before the pandemic — and before the killing of George Floyd and so many others forced us yet again to confront the painful reality of systemic racism in America. People want accountability, and in a democracy the ultimate way we do that is through voting.

"The Biden administration and private companies are working to develop a standard way of handling credentials — often referred to as “vaccine passports” — that would allow Americans to prove they have been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus as businesses try to reopen.
The effort has gained momentum amid President Biden’s pledge that the nation will start to regain normalcy this summer and with a growing number of companies — from cruise lines to sports teams — saying they will require proof of vaccination before opening their doors again.

"WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) ― The Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of a Native American elk hunter, citing an 1868 treaty between his tribe and the U.S. government as it revived his legal challenge to a conviction for hunting out of season in Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming.
In a 5-4 ruling, the high court sided with Crow Tribe member Clayvin Herrera. It found that the treaty, which gave tribe members hunting rights on “unoccupied” lands, is still in force even though it was signed before Wyoming became..."
"The mission of U.S. forces in Iraq has shifted to training and advisory roles, allowing for redeployment of combat forces remaining in the country, U.S. and Iraq delegates said Wednesday, after a third round of strategic U.S.-Iraq talks.
Statements issued by both sides, however, said the timing of such a redeployment would be determined in upcoming technical talks, without specifying when they would take place. They also stressed the need for continued security cooperation.
The talks — held virtually because of the pandemic — began in June under the Trump..."
"The United States and Iraq concluded talks Wednesday on America’s troop presence here, issuing a joint statement that emphasized the growing capacity of the Iraqi military, six years after it crumbled in the face of the Islamic State’s advance.
The statement followed a third round of talks between Washington and Baghdad, known as the Strategic Dialogue, and the first to take place under President Biden.
“Based on the increasing capacity of the ISF [Iraq Security Forces], the parties confirmed that the mission of U.S. and Coalition forces has now transitioned..."
"In early November, President Biden issued two sweeping federal rules aimed at getting as many workers as possible vaccinated against COVID-19. Whether those controversial rules survive is now in the hands of the Supreme Court.
The justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments Friday in a pair of cases revolving around the emergency regulations. Republican leaders and business groups sued to stop the rules from going into effect, leading to injunctions and differing opinions in the lower courts. After groups filed emergency requests with the Supreme Court, the justices decided to expedite both..."

"While many Americans are filled with fear, Melissa Ackison says the coronavirus pandemic has filled her with anger. The stay-at-home orders are government overreach, the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says, and the labeling of some workers as “essential” arbitrary.
“It enrages something inside of you,” said Ackison, who was among those who protested Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son. She has “no fear whatsoever” of contracting the virus, she said Thursday, dismissing it as hype.
The Ohio protest was among a..."
"(CNN) - Patience is in ever-shorter supply. No one is happy with the current situation. But some Americans see the yoke of oppression in public health efforts to keep people home, and they're growing louder.
Underneath the general frustration and dazed acceptance of so much of the world changing its lifestyle for the time being lurks a growing defiance of the science that tells us how to deal with Covid-19 and the government that is telling everyone (to varying degrees) to stay indoors.

"Vice President Kamala Harris was huddled with other White House officials in President Joe Biden's private dining room last week when the room let out a ""collective exhale."" A Minnesota jury had found Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd.
As the large flat-screen television mounted on the north wall flashed three ""guilty"" counts, the room was overcome with a ""sweeping sense of relief,"" an aide said. Harris joined Biden and the first lady moments later in the Oval Office, where Floyd's family was patched in by speakerphone.

"Thousands of Twitter users spent the weekend asking #WhereAreTheChildren?
The viral hashtag sprang up in response to a now widely shared New York Times article noting that the federal government had been unable to make contact with 1,475 unaccompanied minors awaiting deportation hearings.

Immigration experts point out that these children are not in government custody, nor are they supposed to be. Instead, this is a population of minors who arrived at the US border unaccompanied..."
"As the coronavirus advances across the country, more Americans are staying in their homes. That sort of ""social distancing"" is considered essential to slowing the spread of the virus and easing the burden on the beleaguered health infrastructure.
But for those suffering from depression, especially those who struggle with suicidal thoughts, it is definitely not what the doctor ordered.
Any ""isolation is so devastating to our own mood because we're left stuck with our own thoughts,"" said Emily Roberts, a Manhattan-based psychotherapist. ""If you're struggling with a mental health disease,..."
"CHICAGO (AP) — Millions of Americans began their work week holed up at home Monday against the coronavirus outside their doors, as the escalating outbreak shifted the nation’s daily routines in ways never before seen in U.S. history.
As wide swaths of the economy began shuddering to a halt, the financial markets opened with stocks dropping on Wall Street by nearly 10 percent, triggering an automatic 15-minute halt to trading. That came despite emergency Federal Reserve action late Sunday that cut the key interest rate to near zero.

Yellen spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press” just before a slew of economic reports will be released this week that will shed light on an economy currently besieged by rampant inflation and threatened by higher interest rates. The data will cover sales of new homes, consumer confidence, incomes, spending, inflation, and overall output.
The highest-profile report will likely be Thursday, when the Commerce Department will release its first estimate..."
"In Donald Trump’s telling of it, the result of the 2020 election, which has not been held yet—and he might even win—is not legitimate. It’s a note Trump struck in 2016, when it looked like he almost certainly would not win, and it’s a scorched earth approach to democracy that he’s only made more extreme this time around. There’s no way to frame Trump’s approach to the upcoming vote as anything other than the stuff of strongmen and authoritarians. This is how elections are treated in Ankara and Moscow."
"It didn’t work after mass shootings at a nightclub in Orlando, college campuses in Virginia and Oregon, a church in Charleston, or at a movie theater and high school in Colorado. Or after two lawmakers survived assassination attempts. But after a gunman killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 at a Las Vegas concert, Democrats are going to try again to revamp the nation’s gun laws.
And some Republicans signaled that this time may be different."
"Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, said President Trump’s demands for Ukraine to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the 2016 elections amounted to a “domestic political errand” that diverged from American foreign policy goals.
Her testimony made it clear that Dr. Hill, a longtime Russia expert, saw the pressure campaign on Ukraine as a purely political effort that had nothing to do with confronting corruption in Ukraine, the explanation that Mr. Trump and Republicans have frequently given for..."
"President Donald Trump has spent months criticizing business activities by Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who could face Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
The first activities Trump and his allies spotlighted — the younger Biden’s ties to a Ukrainian energy company — have already led to a House impeachment inquiry against Trump. We previously found no evidence that Joe Biden used his official activities to benefit his son.
More recently, as pressure for impeachment has grown, Trump and his allies have been spotlighting another..."
"Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been indicted by an Austin grand jury in connection with a veto of funding for state public corruption prosecutors.
An ethics complaint was filed last summer. The Associated Press has this background on the case:
""The Republican governor is accused of abusing his official powers by publicly promising to veto $7.5 million for the state public integrity unit at the Travis County District Attorney's office. He was indicted by an Austin grand jury Friday.
""Perry said he'd veto the funding if the district attorney,..."
"A grand jury indicted Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Friday on two felony counts: abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public official. The charges are linked to his push for Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, to resign after she was arrested for drunk driving last year.
The case focused on Perry's threat to veto funding to Lehmberg's office unless she resigned. Perry eventually made good on that threat, vetoing $7.5 million that would have gone to the Public Integrity Unit in Lehmberg's office, the Dallas..."

Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the damage on the island is ""catastrophic in many areas,"" calling it a ""very delicate and sad situation."" Heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding was continuing across the island Sunday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The Category 1 hurricane was predicted to produce dangerous landslides and heavy flooding on an already storm-battered island."
"One of the most frustrating aspects of the pandemic has been watching school districts try to navigate the complexities of remote learning with so little guidance from Washington. The silence is equally deafening when it comes to figuring out when and how districts should reopen their campuses.
Yes, the federal government provided much-needed funding, which helped buy computers and broadband access for students and cover other pandemic-related costs. Far more money is needed. But just as essential, if not more so, were information and directives about how to proceed in..."
"The midday arrival of a school bus at Cyliss Castillo’s home on the remote edge of a mesa breaks up the long days of boredom and isolation for the high school senior.
The driver hands over food in white plastic bags, collects Castillo’s school assignments and offers some welcome conversation before setting out for another home.
The closing of classrooms and the switch to remote learning because of the coronavirus have left Castillo and other students in this school district on the sparsely populated fringe of the Navajo Nation in..."
"The impeachment of President Trump has dominated the news this week. But the political focus shifted to the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for their sixth debate, this one in Los Angeles and hosted by the PBS NewsHour and Politico.
The first subject to come up? Impeachment. But there are no real cleavages between the candidates on that subject. After all, each of the candidates thinks he shouldn't be in office. That's why they're running against him.
There was a notable moment when former Vice President Joe Biden defended his..."
"Race was always going to be a topic in Thursday night’s Democratic debate, if only by omission. California Sen. Kamala Harris had already dropped out of the race, and under the more restrictive qualifying rules for this round, the low-polling but game Julián Castro and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker were left out—as was Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, though she said she would have refused to attend anyway. Only the last-minute qualification of Andrew Yang spared the party from presenting an all-white stage.
But confronted with the diminished diversity of..."
"Democratic lawmakers on Friday trashed a draft report released by President Joe Biden’s recently formed Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court, saying its findings fall short of the kinds of reforms needed to restore integrity to the court.
“This report is a disappointment to anyone who’d hoped for a hard-hitting effort to address the Supreme Court’s deep troubles,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

"Drug overdoses in the United States were deadlier than ever in 2021, according to provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Nearly 108,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2021, and about two-thirds of those deaths involved fentanyl or another synthetic opioid.
Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the US, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Annual deaths were nearly 50% higher in 2021 than in 2019, CDC data shows.
The spike in overdose deaths in the second year of the pandemic wasn't as..."
"Hillary Clinton surged to a broad advantage against Donald Trump in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, capitalizing on Trump’s recent campaign missteps. Two-thirds of Americans see him as biased against groups such as women, minorities or Muslims, and a new high, 64 percent, call Trump unqualified to serve as president."
"The U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad was hit by three rockets on Sunday. One person sustained minor injuries, a U.S. official told CNN. Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, where the embassy is located, has come under rocket attack several times in the last few months and was the site of large protests of U.S. airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias in December. No one has claimed responsibility for the latest attack."
"Jurors found both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard liable for defamation against each other in a verdict reached Wednesday.
They awarded Depp $15 million in damages, finding that Heard defamed him when she described herself as a victim of domestic violence in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed. The jury found that Heard's statements were false and made with ""actual malice"" against her ex-husband, and decided on $10 million in compensatory damages and another $5 million in punitive damages. Judge Penney Azcarate, who is overseeing the case, lowered the punitive damages..."
"There’s no word if Donald Trump was up all night watching ”An Affair to Remember” and eating rocky road ice cream, but clearly Donnie was crushed that he was forced to sign the Russian sanctions bill, prompting BFF Putin to accuse him of “total weakness,” because on Thursday morning he lashed out … at Republicans:"
"Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to hold an advantage over President Donald Trump in the polls. Given that we're past both major party conventions and closing in on Labor Day, the only fair conclusion to reach is that Biden's the favorite.
Yet, it continues to be clear that the national polling will continue to overstate Biden's edge. An examination of the state polls shows a race that, while not a tossup by any means, is closer than the national polls would indicate."
"Hillary Clinton's decision to personally raise money for a super PAC supporting her campaign is agitating her progressive critics, who see the move as further proof that the Democratic presidential frontrunner doesn't share some of their values.
There was never any expectation that Clinton would renounce super PAC money this election cycle. But liberal activists determined to use the Democratic primary to pressure Clinton to embrace a progressive agenda say the idea of the former secretary of state personally wooing the wealthiest class of donors runs counter to the populist..."
"Hillary Rodham Clinton is running as the most liberal Democratic presidential front-runner in decades, with positions on issues from gay marriage to immigration that would, in past elections, have put her at her party's precarious left edge.
The moves are part of a strategic conclusion by Clinton's emerging campaign: that it can harness the same kind of young and diverse coalition as Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012, bolstered by even stronger appeal among women."
"Sweeping climate and health care legislation unveiled by Democrats last week would lead to significant cuts in energy costs for American households, according to a new analysis.
A report by non-profit group Rewiring America found that the tax incentives included as part of the $369 billion dedicated to climate initiatives in the Inflation Reduction Act would save the average household $1,800 per year on energy bills.
“It is a market-tilting level of investment,” Ari Matusiak, the group's co-founder and CEO who was involved with the crafting of the bill, told Yahoo Finance. “The beneficiaries..."
"Most other candidates would have folded. Some might have doubled down. On Saturday, Donald Trump tripled down.
After refusing to back off during weeks of fierce backlash for his comments about the alleged criminality of undocumented Mexican immigrants, Trump met on Friday in Beverly Hills with the families of people killed by such immigrants. A day later, he came to Arizona and said, “We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to. We have to,” to the cheers of 4,000 supporters."
"Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and reality television star who has taken center stage in the race for the Republican presidential nomination this week, delivered a rambling monologue on Saturday, dismissing a long list of critics — including Jeb Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Macy’s — while rallying what he termed a new silent majority of voters.
Mr. Trump had less to say about immigration, the topic on which his comments have garnered so much attention, than about those who have criticized him. For more than an hour, he..."
"Americans are worried about inflation. But what can the government do about it?
The traditional response to inflation looks to the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and cool the economy. Notwithstanding the risk of provoking a recession, the Fed is doing this—but it will take a decent period of time for interest rate hikes to reduce inflation."

"A majority of Americans are dissatisfied or angry with President Barack Obama's administration and GOP leaders, according to exit polls released Tuesday and analyzed by CNN.
And about 8 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, according to a survey of voters outside of polling places on Election Day."
"Call it a thumping. Call it a shellacking. However you want to describe the 2014 midterm elections, the point remains the same. Democrats took it on the chin Tuesday night, losing the Senate, getting crushed in winnable governors' races, solidifying their minority status in the House for years to come, and stemming the party's ability to continue putting its stamp on the judiciary.
The question is whether it was all avoidable. Democratic strategists will say that the party was dealt a terrible hand, forced to defend too many vulnerable Democrats..."
"Senate Democrats, in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have unequivocally rejected further consideration of Republicans’ police reform bill — legislation they think falls far short of the policy changes they’d like to see.

The President said that he supports changing the Senate rules and eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation.
""Today, I'm making it clear to protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights. When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate,"" he said.

Biden took the oath at a U.S. Capitol that had been battered by an insurrectionist siege just two weeks earlier. On a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries, the quadrennial ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Instead,..."
"If it's Friday in politics, there's the potential for a news dump.
This Friday, that means tax returns. The Clinton campaign, in an effort to pressure Donald Trump into releasing his taxes, released the Clintons' 2015 numbers. The Clintons made $10.6 million combined, mostly from speeches, and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, also released 10 years' returns. In 2015, Kaine made about $313,000 and paid a 16.1 percent tax rate. (Here are all the tax returns released by the Clinton campaign.)"
"Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, released a new batch of their own income tax returns on Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on her opponent, Donald J. Trump, to begin making public his own forms.
The newest tax return of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, showed an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million for 2015, a large drop from previous years but still enough to place them in the top 0.1"

"With the vaccine rollout underway and coronavirus cases declining after a dark winter surge, it may seem as though the end of the pandemic is in sight. In reality, how soon could we get there?
One answer lies in herd immunity, the point when enough people are immune to the virus that it can no longer spread through the population. Getting there, however, depends not just on how quickly we can vaccinate but on other factors, too, like how many people have already been infected and how easily the virus..."
"Health officials around the world are racing to vaccinate enough people to stop the spread of COVID-19, but what qualifies as “enough” is still an open question.
The goal is to get to “herd immunity,” which is when enough people have immunity, either from vaccination or a past infection, to stop uncontrolled spread.
Herd immunity doesn’t make any one person immune, and outbreaks can still flare up. It means that a virus is no longer easily jumping from person to person, helping to protect those who are still vulnerable to..."

"Senate Democrats and Republicans grilled the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter on Wednesday at a highly partisan, wide-ranging review of their content-moderation practices less than a week before Election Day.
Lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee are convening the gathering chiefly to discuss a controversial, decades-old law known as Section 230 that spares social media sites from being held liable for the way they police their platforms.
But the hearing is a public trial of sorts for Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Sundar Pichai and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, who..."
"Donald Trump still has grievances to air — and a Republican Party eager to bask in his indignation.
In his first major address since leaving office, Trump on Sunday laced into his Democratic successor, Joe Biden, chided “establishment political hacks” from his own party and pressed his false claim that he won the November election, which he lost decisively.
And to an explosion of applause, he suggested he may run again in 2024."

"President Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night, a speech that came amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lagging poll numbers in advance of the 2022 midterm elections.
I watched the speech -- and the reaction to it -- and jotted down some of the best and the worst of the night.
Ever since Ronald Reagan first invited honored guests to the State of the Union, it's been an opportunity for presidents to strike memorable moments in a speech that often feels like a laundry list..."
"When he prepares to cast his vote in his first-ever presidential election on Tuesday, Noah Foster, 20, a junior at Carroll University in Wisconsin, will go through a mental checklist:
Specialized school ID. Check.
Proof of enrollment. Check.
Proof of residency. Check.
Ride to the polling site. Check.
“It’s exhausting, for sure,” said Foster, who plans to vote for Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election. “These are the little issues we run into that makes the process so hard.”
From pandemic fears to complex ID requirements..."
"On the first and third Monday of each month, Theresa Burroughs traveled to Alabama's Hale County courthouse to register to vote. On each trip, she was met by a group of White men playing dominoes.
One of those men oversaw voter registration in the county. He'd point to a jar of jelly beans on a nearby table and ask Burroughs, ""How many black jelly beans are in a jar? How many red ones in there?""
It was the late 1940s, and Burroughs was a Black woman who knew she..."
"Some voters in Georgia are experiencing hourslong lines to cast their ballots in Tuesday's primary, with officials trading blame for who, exactly, is responsible for the latest trip-up in holding an election during the pandemic.
Since polls opened early Tuesday morning, voters in Georgia — especially in and around Atlanta — have reported problems with voting machines and long lines, with some voters leaving without casting a ballot. The problems are a troubling sign for the burgeoning swing state's ability to handle the expected high turnout for November's presidential election...."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, after previously suggesting stimulus could wait until 2021, is now saying he’d back a package this year.
“As I’ve said repeatedly in the last few months, we need another rescue package,” McConnell said Wednesday. “Hopefully the partisan passions that prevented us from doing another rescue package will subside with the election. … I think we need to do it before the end of the year.”
Does that mean stimulus is actually coming in 2020 for the 21.5 million Americans still receiving unemployment insurance, the cities..."
"President Biden on Monday urged Americans to remain calm as scientists work to determine the strength and the transmissibility of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, saying the U.S. has the ability to deal with the new strain that is circulating the globe.
The president, flanked by chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci and Vice President Kamala Harris, told the nation the variant is a ""cause for concern, not a cause for panic."" He said the U.S. has more tools to fight COVID-19 than ever before, and is in a much..."
"Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama Friday over the state’s near-total abortion ban — which is exactly what Alabama Republicans wanted. It’s the first step in what promises to be a long legal battle over whether to let the ban go into effect.
Under Alabama’s law, abortions would only be allowed if a pregnancy posed a “serious health risk” to the mother. There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could spend up to 99 years in prison for performing the procedure.
If that sounds unconstitutionally..."
"People across the U.S. will be waking up to news of Donald Trump winning the nation's presidential election this morning.
Here's a look at how American newspapers' front pages and headlines are reporting Trump as the new President-elect:

Headline: ""House of Horrors: Trump seizes Divided States of America"""
"Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man and the biggest shareholder of Twitter, will no longer join the social media service’s board of directors, the company said late Sunday.
The move capped a whirlwind week at Twitter that had been set off by Mr. Musk, 50. On Tuesday, Twitter announced that the billionaire would be appointed to its 11-person board for a term that expires in 2024. The invitation to join the board followed Mr. Musk’s accumulating a 9.2 percent stake in the company, making him its largest shareholder."
"The hosts of Fox & Friends waited until the final moments of their interview with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) to bring up the comments he made about slavery and The New York Times’ ‘1619 Project’ over the weekend. Cotton used the opportunity to accuse them of spreading “fake news.”
“Senator Tom Cotton, you’re in the eye of the storm, you like to take on red-hot issues, including ‘The 1619 Project,’” Brian Kilmeade said as the senator smiled awkwardly. He then quoted directly at length from Cotton’s interview with the..."
"Senate Republicans, who spent most of the last week bemoaning a recent rules change that makes it easier for Democrats to confirm Obama administration appointees, will have to turn their attention this week to the two-year budget deal crafted by the heads of the House and Senate Budget Committees, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash."
"The federal budget deficit will plummet to $642 billion this year, congressional budget analysts said Tuesday, reducing their previous forecast by roughly $200 billion.
The Congressional Budget Office credited recovering tax revenues and a one-time infusion of cash from mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the dramatic reduction, which puts the nation on track for its smallest deficits since the economic crisis hit in 2008.
Moreover, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that the deficit will continue to shrink, falling below 3 percent of the overall..."
"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic nomination to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court moved one step closer Monday afternoon.
The 22-member Senate Judiciary Committee, which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, voted along party lines for an 11-11 tie, rather than offering a ""favorable"" or ""unfavorable"" recommendation. 
Though the tie vote adds a procedural step, it won't stop Jackson's nomination from moving to the full Senate for consideration. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., can set the schedule for a full chamber vote, where Jackson is likely to be confirmed..."
"Long before Hurricane Ida made landfall Sunday in southern Louisiana, climatologist David Keellings was already filled with dread.
As the storm passed over the western end of Cuba and moved over the Gulf of Mexico, Keellings, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, knew it would become fierce and unruly.
""I was saying, 'Uh oh, it’s going to head over some really warm water,'"" he said. ""And it did.""
Once the storm began churning up the Gulf's unusually warm water — 86 degrees at places, even at depths of more than..."
"Sometimes a piece of journalism is so silly and substance-free it’s a waste of time to reply. But I need to correct a couple of errors in James Oliphant’s “Progressive bloggers are doing the White House’s job.” It’s been a long time since I’ve seen bloggers used pejoratively, and I’m not sure what makes me a “blogger” and Oliphant something else, but those debates are so very 2005, so we’ll let them be.

"Gas prices in the United States fell below $4 a gallon on Thursday, retreating to their lowest level since March, a drop that has brought relief to Americans struggling with the skyrocketing cost of everything from groceries to rent.
The national average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline now stands at $3.99, according to AAA, after 58 consecutive daily declines. That’s higher than it was a year ago but still well below a peak of nearly $5.02 in mid-June. Energy costs feed into broad measures of inflation, so the drop is..."
"U.S. troops returning from Ebola-stricken nations will be isolated for 21 days, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Wednesday, a day after the White House raised concerns about states imposing strict quarantines of health care workers returning from West Africa.
Top commanders for the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps made the recommendation to Hagel on Tuesday. The Army instituted an isolation requirement for 21 days — the incubation period for the deadline virus — on Monday.
Hagel's decision goes beyond Pentagon guidelines issued earlier this month that stopped short of..."
"Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Tuesday that all members of the armed services working in Ebola-stricken West African countries undergo mandatory 21-day quarantines upon their return to the United States.
Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that Mr. Hagel was expected to announce shortly that he would follow the recommendation.
The recommendation foll"
"The shift, which is to include much more emphasis on Romneys policy prescriptions, means he is scrapping the most basic precept of his campaign. From the time he began contemplating running again after his loss in the 2008 primaries, Romneys theory of the case has been a relentless and nearly exclusive focus on the listless economy."
"The Biden administration announced Tuesday that it would extend the foreclosure moratorium and mortgage forbearance through the end of June.
The actions would block home foreclosures and offer delayed mortgage payments until July, as well as offer six months of additional mortgage forbearance for those who enroll on or before June 30.
The actions are an extension of an order that was originally enacted under the Trump administration in March of last year. President Joe Biden — as one of 17 orders he signed on his first day in office..."
"The vast majority of Americans favor legislation being considered today in the Senate that would restrict people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns. But the measure will fail because those who oppose stricter gun laws are, on the whole, more passionate and politically organized than the average voters who support them."
"The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether the U.S. Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to enter into same-sex marriages.
The high-profile case has the potential to legalize gay marriage in all 50 states or to roll the practice back by overturning a series of federal court rulings that have dramatically expanded the availability of same-sex unions in the past year-and-a-half.

In an order Friday afternoon, the court announced that it granted four petitions seeking a review of a federal appeals court ruling..."
"The Supreme Court announced Friday that it will decide a historic question about whether the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live or whether states are free to limit wedlock to its traditional definition as a union only between a man and a woman.
The Court accepted Cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee , where restrictions About same-Sex marriage Were Upheld by Appeals Court in an Cincinnati two months ago. The high Court Will hold 2 1/2 hours of oral arguments in..."
"The Pentagon said that two Islamic State militants were killed and one was wounded in Friday night’s drone strike in Nangahar Province as part of the American retaliation for the suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed scores of people, including 13 American service members.
Defense Department officials said one of the Islamic State drone targets was a “planner,” and one was a “facilitator.” Both, they said, were involved in planning attacks against Americans, although officials at a news conference on Saturday declined to say whether they were involved..."
"Two targets were killed and another person was injured in a drone strike against the Islamic State affiliate ISIS-K in retaliation for the Kabul airport attack, the Pentagon now says. And the Department of Defense has released the names of the U.S. troops killed in Thursday's attack.
Department officials announced Friday evening that a drone strike killed an ISIS-K target in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. On Saturday, officials updated that to say that two ""high-profile"" targets — described as ""a planner and a facilitator"" — were killed and one other person from the terrorist..."
"Four people were killed (including the shooter) and at least 12 more injured during a shooting that took place at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival in Christmas Hill Park in Gilroy, California, on Sunday.
One suspect was shot and killed by police at the scene. In a statement, city officials in Gilmore — which is located about 33 miles south of San Jose — said in a statement that “[w]itnesses indicated there may have been a second suspect and a search is underway for that person,” though it’s unclear if..."
"So far, Republicans in Congress have been either quiet or broadly supportive of Donald Trump’s new executive order temporarily barring US entry for natives of seven Muslim-majority countries. That includes House Speaker Paul Ryan, who denounced the idea of a Muslim ban during the campaign only to turn around and support this decision."
"Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said Tuesday night that “excitement” prompted her to pose maskless for a photo last week with a group of elementary schoolchildren — a move that has generated a rash of mostly Republican criticism.
On CNN’s “OutFront,” Abrams explained that she was in the Decatur, Ga., elementary school classroom for a Black History Month reading event on Friday. She said she kept her mask on until she reached the lectern and took it off only because she was reading to students who were “listening remotely, as..."
"PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. official has identified the shooter at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola as a Saudi Arabian aviation student. Authorities are investigating if the shooting was terrorism-related. The shooting was the second at a U.S. Navy base this week. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan says 11 people were shot in Friday’s attack, four of whom died, including the shooter. Base commander Capt. Timothy Kinsella Jr. says the base will remain closed until further notice."
"The moment happened as so many others have. A man unknown to most around the world was about to become a hashtag. Millions would watch a video played countless times over the course of a year, horrified to see a police officer press his knee into the man's neck for 9½ minutes, killing him. The desire to reverse this man's fate seemed as desperate as it was futile. 
The world changed May 25, 2020, mere months after the global pandemic had already altered everything. George Floyd's death, which occurred under the..."
"Lindsey Graham’s anti-abortion legislation once unified the Republican Party. The 15-week abortion ban he pitched Tuesday had the exact opposite effect.
The South Carolina senator chose a uniquely tense moment to unveil his party’s first bill limiting abortion access since this summer’s watershed reversal of Roe v. Wade. It was designed as a nod to anti-abortion activists who have never felt more emboldened. Yet Graham’s bill also attempted to skate past a Republican Party that’s divided over whether Congress should even be legislating on abortion after the Supreme Court struck down..."
"President Barack Obama pushed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel out of his job yesterday after less than 21 months, with White House officials citing disagreements over Iraq and Syria policy.
Hagel, who had grown increasingly frustrated with tight White House management of policy, was ready to go anyway, a U.S. defense official said. He resigned without a fight."
"On a trip to Afghanistan during President Barack Obama's first term, Defense Secretary Robert Gates was stunned to find a telephone line at the military's special operations headquarters that linked directly back to a top White House national security official.
""I had them tear it out while I was standing there,"" Gates said earlier this month as he recounted his discovery. ""I told the commanders, 'If you get a call from the White House, you tell them to go to hell and call me.'""
To Gates, the phone in Kabul..."
"The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. It is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president."
"It hasn’t been a whole week into his tenure, but New York City Mayor Eric Adams loves himself a soundbite. Whether it be declaring that swagger is back in the city and fights over solitary confinement, four days may feel like a lifetime. Right now, he has directed his focus on remote working and “my low-skilled workers.”
Because of the Omicron surge, many larger businesses have pushed back their in-office plans due to increased cases and hospitalizations. Adams says to keep the “ecosystem of the city going,” larger companies should return to in-person work..."
"Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.
The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus, according to lawyers for the whistleblower, a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families, a unit within HHS.
The whistleblower is..."
"Federal workers did not have the necessary protective gear or training when they were sent to help quarantined Americans who were evacuated from China during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a government whistleblower complaint.
The complaint alleges employees with the Department of Health and Human Services were sent to Travis and March Air Force bases in California without full protective gear and training on how to protect themselves in a viral hot zone.
While helping the evacuees, team members noticed that workers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and..."
"Tighter travel rules, free at-home tests and booster shots are key elements of President Joe Biden's latest strategy to combat the rapidly evolving coronavirus.
Biden said his plan to get through the winter months, which he promoted during a visit to the National Institutes of Health on Thursday, is one that ""all Americans hopefully can rally around.""
""My plan I’m announcing today pulls no punches in the fight against COVID-19,"" Biden said. ""It's a plan that I think should unite us.""
Biden emphasized that he was not expanding or adding..."
"The State Department said Tuesday it never concluded that the consulate attack in Libya stemmed from protests over an American-made video ridiculing Islam, raising further questions about why the Obama administration used that explanation for more than a week after assailants killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans."
"The sleepy United States senators thought they were done voting. But then, around 1 a.m. on the Saturday before Memorial Day, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and presidential candidate, marched spryly to the Senate floor to let it be known that, no, he would not agree to extend the federal government’s bulk collection of phone records program. Not even for one day.
With that, Senator Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentucky Republican who only a few hours before was ebullient with the passage of a major trade package, was reduced..."
"A cyberattack on JBS SA, the largest meat producer globally, forced the shutdown of some of world’s largest slaughterhouses, and there are signs that closures are spreading.
JBS’s five biggest beef plants in the U.S. -- which altogether handle 22,500 cattle a day -- halted processing following a weekend attack on the Brazilian company’s computer networks, according to JBS posts on Facebook, labor unions and employees. Those outages wiped out nearly a fifth of America’s production. Slaughter operations across Australia were also down, according to a trade group, and one of Canada’s largest..."
"An Afghan soldier shot a United States Army major general to death and wounded a German brigadier general and at least 14 other foreign and Afghan military service members on Tuesday at a military training academy on the outskirts of Kabul, officials of the American-led coalition said Tuesday. The major general appeared to be the highest-ranking member of the American military to die in hostilities overseas since the Vietnam War.
The coalition officials said a senior Afghan commander also was among the wounded. The officials declined to identify any of..."
"IN THE FIRST instalment of the “Harry Potter” series, the protagonist stumbles across the Mirror of Erised. Anyone who looks into the mirror sees the “deepest, most desperate desire” of their hearts reflected back at them. There is a touch of Erised about President-elect Joe Biden’s decision to nominate Janet Yellen as America’s next treasury secretary, reported on November 23rd. No economist is more qualified than Ms Yellen, a former chair of the Federal Reserve and a respected academic, for the job. Perhaps more important, however, for what is a..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is known as the deal-maker on Capitol Hill, but the current logjam over funding the Department of Homeland Security has everyone wondering if he can prevent a shutdown.
Congress returns on Monday with just four days before the deadline to pass legislation to keep DHS open. A stalemate between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill over President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration has stalled a funding bill for the agency.
Without any serious negotiations or talk of a compromise, it's likely DHS will run..."
"The notion that Congress might actually shut down the Department of Homeland Security as part of a broader fight over President Obama’s immigration policies seemed laughable just a few weeks ago.
Literally.
A top Republican staff member laughed when asked if Republicans, who are usually security-minded, were prepared to shut down the agency in a political battle over Mr. Obama’s recent executive actions.
But now, with just days remaining until funding for the Homeland Security agency runs out on Friday, a shutdown of the department is looking increasingly likel"
"The Democratic presidential field is set to have its smallest and potentially most influential debate yet. It could also become among the most contentious if candidates bring their campaigns’ offstage issues onstage.
On Tuesday at 6 p.m. PST, six candidates are slated to gather at Drake University in Des Moines to slug it out less than three weeks before the first-in-the-nation caucuses in Iowa."
"The headliners were the same, with Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama addressing the Democratic National Convention on its first night, just as they had four years ago in Philadelphia.
But reconciling a divided party is proving easier with a deeply unpopular incumbent in the White House — and with a less polarizing nominee.
It hardly mattered that Joe Biden has disagreements with progressives, as Sanders noted. Or that he is “not perfect,” as Obama volunteered.
So far, Democrats have effectively framed this election as a referendum on Donald Trump. And..."
"DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY The Intercept contain new evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the nearby Wuhan University Center for Animal Experiment, along with their collaborator, the U.S.-based nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance, have engaged in what the U.S. government defines as “gain-of-function research of concern,” intentionally making viruses more pathogenic or transmissible in order to study them, despite stipulations from a U.S. funding agency that the money not be used for that purpose.
Grant money for the controversial experiment came from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and..."
"Authorities in North Carolina say a shooting at an impromptu block party has left two people dead and seven others wounded.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Johnny Jennings told reporters early Monday the shooting happened around midnight at a block party that was a continuation of Juneteenth celebrations. Jennings said police responding to a pedestrian call found hundreds of people in the streets.
After authorities arrived, several shots were fired and the crowd scattered. Jennings said five people were hit by cars while running away from the shooting. He said there..."
"Police in Seattle said one person was wounded in a second shooting in the city’s protest zone in less than 48 hours.
The shooting happened late on Sunday night in the area near Seattle’s downtown area known as Chaz, for “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone”.
Police tweeted that one person was at a hospital with a gunshot wound. The person arrived in a private vehicle and was in serious condition, Harborview Medical Center spokesperson Susan Gregg said in a statement.
A pre-dawn shooting on Saturday left a 19-year-old man dead and..."
"President Joe Biden on Wednesday touted progress his administration has made in alleviating supply chain issues that have spurred shortages of consumer products, raised prices for Americans and contributed significantly to historic levels of inflation in the United States.
""We brought together business and labor leaders to solve problems and the much-predicted crisis didn't occur. Packages are moving, gifts are being delivered and shelves are not empty,"" Biden said at the White House.
Biden on Wednesday received a progress report from members of his Cabinet and private sector CEOs on efforts to tackle supply..."
"Rep. Justin Amash’s decision to form an exploratory committee for a run for president as the Libertarian Party candidate could wind up being a very significant moment in the 2020 race.
Exactly why and how, though, isn’t entirely clear.
Amash (I-Mich.) has been toying with a third-party run since a well-documented rift between him and the Republican Party, which he left symbolically on July 4. Amash was a founding member of the tea party-oriented House Freedom Caucus, but his politics have always skewed more libertarian, and he said he became..."
"The Justice Department has informed the House Judiciary Committee that Attorney General William Barr may not attend a Thursday hearing to review special counsel Robert Mueller’s report due to objections over the panel’s format, according to a Democratic senior committee aide.
The department has balked at the panel’s plans to allow the committee’s counsels from both sides to question Barr after the traditional round of questioning by members. Justice officials also told the committee that they are opposed to the panel’s plan to go into a closed session if..."
"Attorney General William P. Barr, who is scheduled to appear Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee to testify about the special counsel’s report, is threatening to skip the session because he objects to the proposed format for questioning, a spokesman for Representative Jerrold Nadler, the committee chairman, said Sunday.
The committee will hold the hearing with or without Mr. Barr, said the spokesman, Daniel Schwarz.
In addition to allowing each member of the committee to question Mr. Barr for five minutes, Mr. Nadler, Democrat of New York, has proposed a..."
"President Trump delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, laying out the agenda for his presidency and, in broad terms, his vision for the country.
Pulling from his campaign speeches and others since taking office, the president ran off a list of accomplishments since taking office and issued promises for the year ahead. Trump highlighted new lobbying restrictions, and executive orders he put in place to reduce regulations, restart halted oil and gas pipelines, and crack down on illegal immigration.
“Above all else, we will..."
"Angry civil rights groups on Sunday were pressing for new criminal charges following George Zimmerman's acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter in a Florida courtroom.
The NAACP website featured an online petition -- also posted on the liberal site MoveOn.org -- asking the Justice Department to bring federal charges against Zimmerman in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin."
"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday that while he accepts the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin, Florida should reexamine its stand-your-ground law.

Dr. Kessler, a pediatrician and lawyer who headed the Food and Drug Administration during the presidencies of George Bush and Bill Clinton, has been a key adviser to Mr. Biden on Covid-19 policy and is co-chair of the transition team’s Covid-19 task force."
"(CNN)When the euphoria from the announcement that the US House will pursue an impeachment inquiry of President Trump wears off for Democrats and others who oppose Trump's administration, and all the talking heads have spoken, remember this -- it's important: Trump didn't change the country; he revealed it.
It may encourage Americans to follow the news more closely, it may prompt them to stay further away. It could derail Trump's re-election bid or provide his supporters with an energizing rallying cry. Certainly Trump's team is hoping for the latter, considering..."
"President Trump said Wednesday that the push for his impeachment is a ""hoax,"" again denying any wrongdoing during a July call with the Ukrainian president during which he pushed for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival.
""No push, no pressure, no nothing — it's all a hoax, folks. It's all a big hoax,"" Trump said.
He also said that he has spoken with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republicans and that he ""fully supports transparency"" on the whistleblower information.
Trump's remarks come after..."
"House Democrats on Wednesday cleared a $1.5 trillion spending compromise — along with billions in emergency aid for Ukraine — in a major victory for President Joe Biden, even as a rank-and-file revolt forced party leaders to strip billions of dollars in pandemic relief from the same bill.
Democrats were jubilant over the passage of the bill, which was the result of months of protracted battles with GOP leaders. But it wasn’t without last-minute drama in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team were forced to yank the White..."
The suspected gunman in Wednesday's rampage at a South Florida high school is accused of killing at least 17 people with an AR-15 rifle that authorities say he purchased legally. But President Trump is already signaling that the deadliest school shooting since 2012 will not be an occasion to reevaluate
"Senate Democrats dropped the filibuster bomb Thursday, and now the question is what kind of fallout will result from the so-called nuclear option.
By a 52-48 vote, the Senate ended the ability of minority Republicans to continue using filibusters to block some of President Barack Obama's judicial and executive nominations, despite the vehement objections of Republicans.
Majority Democrats then quickly acted on the change by ending a filibuster against one of Obama's nominees for a federal appeals court."
"The partisan battles that have paralyzed Washington in recent years took a historic turn Thursday, as Senate Democrats eliminated filibusters for most presidential nominations, severely curtailing the political leverage of the Republican minority in the Senate and assuring an escalation of partisan warfare.
Saying that “enough is enough,” President Obama welcomed the end of what he called the abuse of the Senate’s advise and consent function, which he said had turned into “a reckless and relentless tool” to grind the gears of government to a halt."
"Law enforcement officials’ abrupt decision to end the case drew accusations from former colleagues that they had undermined the rule of law.
A federal judge overseeing the criminal case of President Trump’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn opened the door late Tuesday for legal experts and other outside parties to oppose the Justice Department’s motion to drop the case, suggesting he has at least some skepticism about the government’s argument that Mr. Flynn should never have been charged.
In a brief order, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the..."
"When Republican Liz Cheney abruptly ended her bid for U.S. Senate Monday, she closed the book on a short-lived but heavily scrutinized campaign, raised numerous questions about her political future, and virtually assured Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) a fourth term. But there's one thing Cheney's decision didn't do: Alter the 2014 landscape in any way or"
"The women on President Donald Trump's shortlist to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court do not reflect Ginsburg’s legacy and could undo key civil rights victories she backed during her 27 years on the court, LGBTQ and civil rights advocates warn.
“Just having a woman, any woman, does not cut it,” Sunu P. Chandy, legal director of the progressive National Women’s Law Center, told NBC News. “We need someone with deep civil rights experience and background if we are looking to fill the legacy of her seat..."
"It is a safe bet when Univision hosts a debate, run by Latino moderators, that immigration will be a primary topic. This was certainly the case in Miami Wednesday night, as the first hour of the Democratic debate was almost entirely devoted to immigration, border security and legalization. The substance of that first half, however, was so full of blatant pandering to Latino voters and wild promises to wield executive power on their behalf that it could come back to haunt the eventual Democratic nominee (likely Hillary Clinton) in a..."
"The Senate on Wednesday approved a sweeping package aimed at boosting domestic production of computer chips and helping the United States stay competitive with China.
The 64-33 vote represents a rare bipartisan victory a little more than three months before the crucial November midterms; 17 Republicans joined all Democrats in voting yes. The package, known as “CHIPS-plus,” now heads to the House, which is expected to pass it by the end of the week and send it to President Joe Biden for his signature."
"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang made a stunning argument in a Washington Post op-ed this week: To combat the recent surge in hate crimes and racism amid the coronavirus pandemic, he suggested, Asian Americans should showcase just how American they are through acts of patriotism and community.
Effectively, he wrote, Asians can help end racism by being the best citizens we can be:
We Asian Americans need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before. We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear,..."
"Last week I was shopping for groceries and preparing to hole up at home with my wife, Evelyn, and our two boys. There was an eerie, peculiar aura in the parking lot in upstate New York as night fell and shoppers wheeled out essentials and snacks.
Three middle-aged men in hoodies and sweatshirts stood outside the entrance of the grocery store. They huddled together talking. One looked up at me and frowned. There was something accusatory in his eyes. And then, for the first time in years, I felt it...."
"Hillary Clinton’s first speech since she won a majority of pledged delegates in the Democratic presidential race included remarks about how abortion relates to other issues. That’s groundbreaking for a presidential candidate.
The term “reproductive justice” was promoted by the grassroots women of color collective SisterSong in the 1990s to describe “the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being” of a person. This means considering a broad array of factors that affect a person’s ability to have, not have and/or raise children."
"The man who fired a nail gun into an FBI field office in Cincinnati on Thursday before he was killed by officers was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, officials said.
Two officials familiar with the matter identified the suspect as Ricky Walter Shiffer.
Officers fatally shot the suspect after failing to negotiate with him, an Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman, Lt. Nathan Dennis, told reporters.

"The cease-fire that took effect Friday appears to have halted 11 days of fighting between Israel and Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers, without resolving any of the underlying issues in the decades-old Middle East conflict.
Almost no one on either side expects this war — which was triggered by protests and clashes in Jerusalem — will be the last.
Israel carried out hundreds of airstrikes against what it said were militant targets across Gaza, destroying homes and damaging vital infrastructure in the impoverished territory, which has been under a crippling blockade..."
"The cease-fire between Hamas militants in Gaza and Israel didn’t come a second too soon.
Israelis should not have to live in fear of rockets raining down, which killed a dozen people living in Israel since fighting broke out 11 days ago. Nor should people in Gaza live in fear that they might become collateral damage from Israeli bombs. Israeli airstrikes and artillery killed at least 230 Palestinians, including militants and many civilians.
Israel has a right — even a responsibility — to put a stop to the rocket attacks at their..."
"Senate Democrats are divided on who should get the next round of stimulus payments, setting up a dispute as they try to approve $1,400 checks in the next Covid-19 relief package.
The most recent round of stimulus checks were cut off for people making more than $99,000 a year, or couples that made above $198,000. President Joe Biden recommended the same threshold in his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.
But some Democrats want to see that income cap lowered.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wants to ""ensure upper-income taxpayers are not..."
"President Joe Biden's 2022 is off to a dreadful start. Prices at the pump could make it even worse.
Crude oil has already zoomed back to two-month highs. Gasoline prices, which move with a lag, have stopped their muted decline. And they're starting to creep higher again.
The energy resurgence is only going to add to the economic anxiety gripping the United States and sinking Biden's poll numbers.
""This is a terrible situation. Gas prices are in this political danger zone,"" Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNN.

"Target CEO Brian Cornell said on Sunday that Americans will drive less and make fewer shopping trips this year because of expensive gasoline and accelerating inflation, Bloomberg reported.
""Some of the historical ways consumers react to inflation will play out again in 2022,"" Cornell said at an event held by the National Retail Federation in New York cited by Bloomberg.
""You'll drive fewer miles, you'll consolidate the number of times and locations where you shop,"" Cornell said at the event, per Bloomberg.
Shoppers are likely to eat at home rather than in restaurants, and..."
"The northeastern U.S. is bracing for its first direct hit from a hurricane in years as Hurricane Henri continued to barrel north Saturday.
The system, which was upgraded to a hurricane with winds of 75 mph as of 5 p.m. Saturday, is forecast to slam into Long Island or southern New England late Saturday or early Sunday at or near hurricane strength, with winds that could approach 80 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.

"The Taliban in this northern province allows girls to attend school. It doesn’t execute soldiers or police. Its fighters are not Pashtun, the main ethnic group that bred and fueled the insurgency. Some members are even former mujahideen, or freedom fighters, who once despised the Taliban and fought against its uprising."
"Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has told state Republican officials that he wants Rep. Tim Scott to become his successor, according to a South Carolina Republican operative with knowledge of the conversations.

"Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina will resign from his Senate seat as of Dec. 31 to take over as head of the Heritage Foundation, his office announced Thursday.
""I honestly believe that I can do a lot more on the outside than I can on the inside,"" DeMint told reporters at Heritage Thursday.
According to a source close to the senator, DeMint was formally offered the job and accepted it on Wednesday. He told his staff Thursday morning and called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and South Carolina..."
"President Donald Trump backed a coronavirus response package Friday that was hammered out by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, all but ensuring that the measure will pass the House with strong bipartisan support Friday evening.
Trump's tweet, just before 9 p.m., ended a week of whiplash as Democrats and the White House appeared, at times, inches from a deal only to see it yanked away amid technical disputes and uncertainty from the president.
Trump's backing, though, was essential to ensure support from congressional Republicans for the sweeping,..."
"Before Jeffrey Epstein's confidant Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested Thursday, she was hiding out at a 156-acre property in rural New Hampshire that was paid for in cash through a limited liability company, according to federal prosecutors.
The description matches a luxury home purchased last year for $1 million in a deal shrouded in secrecy, according to two people familiar with the transaction.
The home on East Washington Road in Bradford was bought in December through a limited liability company, Granite Reality LLC, set up the previous month, records show. The..."
"Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite charged with helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse girls, agreed to a detention hearing in Manhattan.
Maxwell, who was arrested Thursday morning in New Hampshire, waived her right to a bail hearing there in a brief videoconference in federal court in Manchester on Thursday."
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce this week whether she will create a new committee to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, weeks after Republicans blocked a bipartisan probe under pressure from former President Donald Trump.
Pelosi’s office clarified Tuesday night that she had not formally announced plans to form that committee, capping an hour of confusion after reports surfaced that she had done so at a closed-door meeting earlier that night. In that discussion, Pelosi seemed to suggest that she would move forward with creating the committee,..."
"Russia plans to seize the Donbas region and southern Ukraine, a military official said, explaining the latter move was a “way to Transnistria“, the Russia-backed breakaway region in Moldova.
Rustam Minnekaev, deputy commander of Russia’s central military district, made the announcement on Friday at a meeting in Sverdlovsk, according to Russian media.
He said capturing Donbas would enable Moscow to forge a land bridge between the Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula it annexed in 2014, and the eastern region.
“Control over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transnistria, where there is..."
"Last week, nearly every state in the U.S. experienced an increase in daily coronavirus cases. Driven by the Delta variant, this rise and an accompanying increase in hospitalizations have sparked a debate about returning to indoor mask mandates for all, regardless of vaccination status.
Los Angeles County announced Thursday that face masks will be required indoors for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and the state of Hawaii has maintained a similar requirement amid rising cases. However, officials in both New York City and Chicago recently rejected the idea of a new universal indoor mask mandate.
Are mask requirements again necessary in the U.S.? Our..."
"President Biden on Wednesday asked U.S. intelligence agencies to “redouble their efforts” to determine the origins of the coronavirus, saying in a statement that he was calling for a broad government report that incorporated findings from American labs and other federal agencies on whether the virus was accidentally leaked from a lab or transmitted by an animal to humans.
He asked intelligence officials to report back to him in 90 days on the results of their work and to keep Congress “fully apprised.”
Mr. Biden’s statement came as top health..."
WASHINGTON mdash President Barack Obama will return 5 percent of his salary each month to the Treasury in a show of solidarity with federal workers smarting from government-wide spending cuts the White House said Wednesday. Obamas decision grew out of a desire to share in the sacrifice that government employees are making said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
"I absolutely hate wearing a mask on long flights. I'm also appalled that masks are no longer required for air travel and on other forms of public transit.
On Monday, a federal judge in Florida ruled that the Biden administration's public transportation mask mandate was unenforceable. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle held, overstepped its authority in issuing the directive requiring masks on airplanes and other forms of mass transit.
This decision is particularly disastrous for older adults, the ill and the immunocompromised, who still face..."
"The unlawful traffic across the southern U.S. border is not one-way, a fact driven home by the federal lawsuit filed this month by the Mexican government against a host of U.S. gun manufacturers and distributors. It’s a somewhat brazen — and welcome — move.
The U.S. is the indirect armament supplier for deadly drug wars in Mexico and the gangsters of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The American appetite for illicit narcotics draws drugs northward; the “iron river” of weapons flows south; Mexican and Central American society is torn apart by terror and murder;..."
"Counterterror police are investigating the death of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed while meeting constituents at a routine public surgery on Friday.
The 69-year-old suffered multiple injuries in the attack at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea.
Essex Police said a 25-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder, and that counterterror detectives were investigating his motivations.
The Independent understands that the suspect is a British national of Somali origin, and the killing is being treated at this point as a probable Islamist terror attack.
The investigation is also..."
"The whistleblower complaint that has triggered a tense showdown between the U.S. intelligence community and Congress involves President Trump’s communications with a foreign leader, according to two former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
Trump’s interaction with the foreign leader included a “promise” that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community, said the former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss..."
"House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff vowed Thursday he's willing to sue the Trump administration over a dispute about the contents of as-yet unknown complaint to the intelligence community's official watchdog.
Schiff told reporters after a closed-door meeting with the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, that the Justice Department has opined that the material is shielded by privilege and can be withheld from lawmakers.
Not so, Schiff argued, and ""if we have to go to court to get this, we will have a good case."""
Roy Moore’s victory in Alabama and Bob Corker’s retirement in Tennessee on Tuesday sent shock waves across the Capitol and shivers down the spines of institutionalists in both parties. The dual developments are fueling concerns about the long-term health of the world’s greatest deliberative body and heightening fears that the center may not hold in American politics.
"On Wednesday, President Donald Trump did something incredibly dangerous.
Asked by a reporter about QAnon, a conspiracy group that has been labeled a potential domestic terrorism threat by the FBI, Trump said this:
""Well, I don't know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don't know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity and from what I hear it's -- these are people that -- they watch the streets of Portland --..."
"President Trump addressed the baseless, far-right QAnon conspiracy theory directly for the first time on Wednesday, saying he didn't know much about the online community and its followers other than ""they like me very much.""
""I heard that these are people who love our country,"" Trump added in response to a question about the conspiracy community during a press briefing at the White House.
When a reporter partially summed up the conspiracy theory to him — that it revolves around a false narrative that Trump is leading a secret, government-led..."
"Who has the most campaign cash on hand? Who spent about as much money as they raised? Who relied heavily on personal loans and past political accounts?
Democratic presidential candidates on Monday provided the first broad look at campaign finances. Early fund-raising is no guarantee of votes in 2020, but it is a barometer of which Democrats are generating interest — not an easy feat in a crowded field.

"President Joe Biden is keeping a watchful eye on this week's closing arguments in the Minneapolis trial of Derek Chauvin, fearful that a controversial verdict could inflame new racial tensions and further escalate a deepening crisis in confidence with the nation's police forces.
The President voiced his concern about potential fallout from the trial during a private meeting last week with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, people familiar with the session said. For weeks, it has also been a point of worry in conversations with Vice President Kamala Harris,..."
"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, will remain the beneficiaries of a sprawling real estate and investment business still worth as much as $740 million, despite their new government responsibilities, according to ethics filings released by the White House Friday night."
"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation hearings may have been historic, in that she is the first Black woman nominated for the Supreme Court. 
But they have not been without precedent, at least with regard to questions on crime and race that she faced from some Republican senators, such as Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who have tried to portray her as ""soft on crime."" 
Civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill, who is president and director-counsel emeritus of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, tweeted Tuesday that listening to Cotton question Jackson reminded her of Arkansas Sen...."
"U.S. lawmakers are questioning Google over how the company’s search engine shows users in certain states inaccurate results about abortion services by diverting them to “fake clinics” that don’t provide the procedure and dissuade people from ending a pregnancy.
In a letter sent Friday to Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, 20 Democratic members of Congress and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) urged the company to quickly rectify the search accuracy issue, noting it comes as a U.S. Supreme Court decision due later this month could overturn the right..."
"The Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to the Affordable Care Act on Thursday in a decision that will leave the law intact and save health care coverage for millions of Americans. The justices turned away a challenge from Republican-led states and the former Trump administration, which urged the justices to block the entire law.
The justices said that the challengers of the 2010 law did not have the legal right to bring the case."
"One week after we moved Nevada and Florida from ""battleground"" to ""lean Democratic,"" both states appear to be snapping back to their traditional toss-up status. Our new CNN electoral outlook places both states back in the ""battleground"" category and increases the up-for-grabs turf to six states and two congressional districts worth a total of 87 electoral votes."
"Lawmakers will get their first chance Tuesday to expose the security failures that allowed rioters to overtake the Capitol on Jan. 6 and threaten the presidential transition of power.
At a rare joint oversight hearing, senators are set to hear from security officials who were on duty when a mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters ransacked the building and sent them fleeing for their lives. The story of Jan. 6 has become clearer as hundreds of rioters have faced charges, but high-level decision-making by top congressional security officials has..."
"Three days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, President Biden used a break between Group of Seven summit meetings at the luxury Schloss Elmau resort in Germany to get an update on the stunning and sudden loss of abortion rights for millions of Americans back home.
Huddling with top aides, including some who dialed in from the White House, Biden declared at the outset of the call that he wanted to endorse ending the Senate filibuster to codify Roe into law, a position he so far had refused to take, angering..."
"A new ""religious freedom"" law in Indiana touched off a firestorm of criticism across the country Friday, after opponents warned that it could lead to legal discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals in the state's business establishments.
The measure, which Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed into law Thursday, allows any individual or corporation to cite religious beliefs as a defense when sued by a private party. The legislation has already prompted threats of boycott from public officials and"
"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence says concerns that his state's new ""religious freedom"" law will allow businesses to turn away LGBT customers is the result of a ""tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding.""
But he refused Sunday to answer at least six yes-or-no questions about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians.
And he said he won't support legislation that would clean up the public relations mess by adding protections based on sexual orientation to Indiana's anti-discrimination laws."
"Stephen K. Bannon, a onetime aide to former President Donald J. Trump, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Friday on two counts of contempt of Congress, the Justice Department said.
Mr. Bannon, 67, had refused last month to comply with subpoenas for information issued by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The House then voted to hold Mr. Bannon in criminal contempt of Congress after he declined to testify or provide documents sought by the committee, a position taken by a number of former aides to Mr. Trump."
"The Justice Department’s investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden’s taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The revelation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father’s successful White House campaign. Hunter Biden was the focus of Republican complaints during the campaign for business dealings with Ukraine and China. But Hunter Biden hasn’t been charged, and two Republican-led congressional committees in September found no wrongdoing by Joe..."
"President-elect Joe Biden’s son Hunter said Wednesday that his “tax affairs” are under federal investigation, putting a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father’s campaign.
In a statement released by the president-elect’s transition office, the younger Biden said he learned about the investigation Tuesday. He did not disclose details of the matter.
“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with..."
"This is a pivotal moment in American history. Do we, as a nation, join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee comprehensive health care to every person as a human right? Or do we maintain a system that is enormously expensive, wasteful and bureaucratic, and is designed to maximize profits for big insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street and medical equipment suppliers?"
"President Trump went out of his way on Friday to distance himself from Matthew G. Whitaker, his choice to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general, saying repeatedly that he did not know Mr. Whitaker and had not spoken to him and emphasizing that the new attorney general was merely “there in an acting position.”"
"A gunman fired multiple shots at the National War Memorial in Ottawa on Wednesday and shot a Canadian soldier, Reuters reports.
The gunman then ran towards Parliament Hill, which is located across the street from the National War Memorial. Witnesses said they heard gunfire in several locations in the building.

"AHEAD OF THE August 2015 Fox News debate, the company’s chair, Rupert Murdoch, issued a directive to debate moderator Megyn Kelly: The Donald Trump thing has gone on long enough, it’s time to take him down. Kelly took a bat to candidate Trump, listing off his most misogynistic remarks, asking how he could explain them to voters. But Trump ended up winning that war.
Democrats assembled in Iowa Tuesday night for the opportunity to take him on in the upcoming general election. This time, though, it was CNN moderators who..."
"A Texas law that would have banned much social media moderation is once again on hold. In a 5-4 ruling handed down today, the Supreme Court vacated an earlier decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, meaning that HB 20 — which forbids banning, demonetizing, or downranking Texas users’ posts based on “viewpoint” — will be blocked while a lawsuit over its constitutionality proceeds. A lower court had already blocked the law in 2021 before the Fifth Circuit unblocked it this May.

"In a significant defeat for former President Donald Trump, the Supreme Court on Monday declined to step in to halt the turnover of his tax records to a New York state prosecutor.
The court’s action is the apparent culmination of a lengthy legal battle that had already reached the high court once before.
Trump’s tax records are not supposed to become public as part of prosecutors’ criminal investigation, but the high court’s action is a blow to Trump because he has long fought on so many fronts to keep his..."
"Attorney General William Barr on Monday rejected several of President Donald Trump's inflammatory and unfounded statements regarding the presidential election, saying at a news conference that he doesn't plan to appoint a special counsel to investigate President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter or the election.
""If I thought a special counsel at this stage was a right tool and was appropriate, I would name one, but I haven't and I'm not going to,"" Barr said in response to a question on the presidential election. He said that widespread fraud wasn't found..."
"I woke up Thursday morning to the news that Elon Musk, the world’s richest troll, wants to buy Twitter, one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. So I went on Twitter and wrote: “I am frightened by the impact on society and politics if Elon Musk acquires Twitter. He seems to believe that on social media anything goes. For democracy to survive, we need more content moderation, not less.”
The hyperbolic reaction was a sight to behold. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who had one of her Twitter accounts permanently suspended for spreading covid-19..."
"More than 130 Secret Service officers who help protect the White House and the president when he travels have recently been ordered to isolate or quarantine because they tested positive for the coronavirus or had close contact with infected co-workers, according to three people familiar with agency staffing.
The spread of the coronavirus — which has sidelined roughly 10 percent of the agency’s core security team — is believed to be partly linked to a series of campaign rallies that President Trump held in the weeks before the Nov. 3..."
"The Times obtained Donald Trump’s tax information extending over more than two decades, revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs, an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due.
Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.
He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.

"Georgians sifting through piles of campaign mail mixed in with their holiday cards can blame the state’s unique runoff system, which has survived multiple legal and political challenges since it originated more than 100 years ago.
Georgia is one of 10 states, mainly in the deep South, that require a runoff if no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in a primary election. But Georgia is alone in mandating runoffs in general elections, which is how the state is hosting two Senate contests on Jan. 5 that will..."
"The political world has trained its focus on Georgia's two U.S. Senate races, which will settle the kind of Senate that President-elect Joe Biden will be dealing with.
The races, taking place Tuesday — the day before Biden is slated to be certified by Congress as the winner of the 2020 presidential election — are expected to be close. Consider that Biden won the rapidly changing but previously traditionally Republican state by fewer than 12,000 votes.
Two wins for Democrats, and they will control the Senate, along with the White..."

"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Last week was an eventful one for Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio kingpin who has dominated airwaves for years.
During his show last Monday, Limbaugh, 69, told listeners he has advanced lung cancer, a grim diagnosis. The next evening, Limbaugh cried on live TV as President Donald Trump used the State of the Union address to award the radio host the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor."
"America’s employers slowed their hiring in September but still added 263,000 jobs, a solid figure that will likely keep the Federal Reserve on pace to keep raising interest rates aggressively to fight persistently high inflation.
Friday’s government report showed that hiring fell from 315,000 in August to the weakest monthly gain since April 2021. The unemployment rate dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, matching a half-century low.
The Fed is hoping that a slower pace of hiring would eventually mean less pressure on employers to raise pay and pass those costs..."

"There is already so much bad news about Covid-19 that no one needs to look very hard to find it. On Memorial Day, the United States was hovering around 25,000 new cases a day; on Labor Day, the figure is more than six times higher. The daily death total is about where it was last Thanksgiving. Deaths in Louisiana and Florida alone are outpacing those in the United Kingdom. More than 100,000 are hospitalized across the country. Not so long ago, it seemed we were on the verge of turning a corner—either to a return to..."

"After Republicans passed a major tax rewrite on Wednesday, budget experts thought there was no way Congress would let the government shut down days later.
But we can't entirely rule out a shutdown going into Congress's Christmas break. Lawmakers have until midnight Friday to pass a spending bill to keep the government open, and Republican leaders don't have a plan for how to do that."
"President-elect Donald J. Trump has settled on Gen. John F.

"Wall Street’s record-breaking 11-year “bull market” came to an end on Wednesday as fears about the spreading Covid-19 pandemic hit stock markets again.
US stock markets have been on an unprecedented streak since 2009, a bull market of gains. On Wednesday investors sold off shares across all sectors after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic for the first time and criticized “alarming levels of inaction” by governments in corralling the virus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down over 1,400 points, 5.8%. After days of wild fluctuations,..."
"As part of his new effort to focus on school safety in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, President Trump has returned to an old punching bag: his predecessor. Trump's school safety commission will investigate an Obama policy originally meant to help minority students avoid disciplinary discrimination. The policy, despite its success in some areas, has come under fire in conservative circles because of a perception that it lets dangerous individuals avoid punishment."
"With just more than 200 days left until the 2022 election, there's little evidence that President Joe Biden's poll numbers are improving -- and there's some data to suggest things are getting worse.
CNN's poll of polls -- an average of the last four national polls of Americans -- pegs Biden's approval at just 39% with 55% disapproving. Those numbers haven't changed much from the 40% approval/54% disapproval that CNN's poll of polls measured in March or the 41% approval/54% disapproval from mid-January.
They also make clear that the bump Biden..."

"Stocks were bludgeoned in yet another volatile session on Wednesday, sinking to a three year low with worldwide cases of the coronavirus soaring above 200,000, amid panic selling that nearly wiped out all of the gains made since President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017.
The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has forced governments around the world to consider stimulus measures and imposing stiff restrictions to prevent further spreading. However, the economic fallout is already being felt, with several indicators deteriorating sharply, and Wall Street predicting a recession this year...."

"China and the U.S. agreed on the text of a phase one trade deal that includes the removal of tariffs on Chinese goods in stages, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said, as President Donald Trump confirmed that some levies will be reduced and said the next round of talks will start immediately.
China will increase imports from the U.S. and other countries, Wang said at a briefing in Beijing Friday. Vice Chairman of the National Reform and Development Commission Ning Jizhe added that the specifics of agricultural purchases would be..."
"President Trump and China finally agreed to a partial trade deal on Friday, putting the 21-month trade war between the world’s two largest economies on pause — for now.
Trump’s White House rushed to characterize it as “amazing” and “historic.” Top Chinese officials held a rare news conference to emphasize this deal was a win for them that meets the “growing needs of the Chinese people.” Stocks hit record highs Thursday as Wall Street applauded the news, but stocks ended little changed Friday as details trickled out. Democratic leaders and..."
"The big day is finally here for President Trump and GOP House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.). On Thursday, the House is set to vote on the tax bill, the central piece of the Republican plan to boost the U.S. economy. No Democrats are expected to vote for the bill, meaning Ryan can only lose 22 GOP votes."
"Even before the start of the war in Ukraine, an international alliance to rally the world against a Russian invasion came together so quickly that President Biden later marveled at the “purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.”
Now, with the conflict in its fourth month, U.S. officials are facing the disappointing reality that the powerful coalition of nations — stretching from North America across Europe and into East Asia — may not be enough to break the looming stalemate in Ukraine.
With growing urgency, the Biden administration..."
"President Trump on Saturday agreed to scale back restrictions on Chinese technology giant Huawei and delay new tariffs from going into effect against Chinese goods as part of an effort to restart trade talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
The major concessions, which came on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit, came after more than a month of acrimonious fighting between two of the world’s largest economies. Trump expressed hope that the measures would lead to a large trade deal with China, though major issues remain and..."
"President Donald Trump arrived in Florida just before 11 a.m. on Wednesday, with an hour left in his presidency, as he opted to skip the swearing in and instead retreat to his residence on the coast.

"We learned this week that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team investigating the Trump-Russia scandal have begun working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D), whose office is also scrutinizing relevant players in the controversy. It’s an important revelation: if charges are eventually filed against anyone involved in the affair, Donald Trump wouldn’t be able to issue pardons to anyone accused of state crimes."
"The Supreme Court has officially overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating federal abortion protections that stood for almost 50 years. On Friday, June 24, the conservative majority released its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, confirming the outcome a leak made clear in May when Politico published a draft ruling by Justice Samuel Alito. Roe prohibited states from outlawing abortion before viability (around 24 weeks into a pregnancy) and after, in cases where pregnancy turned out to threaten the patient’s life or health. In Dobbs, Mississippi challenged those terms directly, asking the Court to uphold its 15-week ban by..."
"U.S. employers in June advertised the most monthly job openings in more than 13 years.
Employers posted 4.67 million jobs in June, up 2.1 percent from May's total of 4.58 million, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The number of advertised openings was the highest since February 2001, a positive sign that points to a strengthening economy."
"Job openings crept up for the fifth straight month in June, reaching their highest level since February 2001, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
The seasonally adjusted level of openings was 4.7 million on June 30, up from 4.6 million at the end of May, according to the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics."
"Steve Bannon appears before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning, supposedly to answer questions about his role in Trump’s campaign and any connection to Russian operatives. This comes after Bannon first described the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump’s top campaign staff and a group of Russian representatives as both “treasonous” and “unpatriotic”—and then went on to explain how to do secret meetings with the Russians correctly."
"David Schoen, one of former President Donald Trump’s defense attorneys, said the Senate impeachment trial could wrap up on Saturday.
Speaking with reporters on Thursday evening, Schoen said the defense team would likely take three to four hours on Friday to present its arguments. He added that the trial was “moving much more quickly” than anticipated.
Schoen had initially requested to pause the trial from sundown Friday till Sunday so he could observe the Sabbath. But he withdrew the request, adding that he would simply not participate in the trial..."
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Saturday rejected an election challenge spearheaded by U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, who argued that a law permitting no-excuse mail voting violated the state Constitution.
Kelly, along with several other Pennsylvania Republicans, sought to invalidate millions of mail-in votes, which could have ceded a key state won by President-Elect Joe Biden to President Donald Trump.
The ruling said, ""Petitioners sought to invalidate the ballots of the millions of Pennsylvania voters who utilized the mail-in voting procedures. ... Alternatively, Petitioners advocated the extraordinary proposition that the court..."
"Ted Cruz isn't shy.
He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.
So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican p"
"The audience should have belonged to Sen. Rand Paul. After all, the thousand or so clean-cut millennials in the D.C.-area ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty, a student group founded by Paul’s father, former Rep. Ron Paul.
The kids chuckled appreciatively as Rand unspooled his tart, college-dorm-room disdain for government. But he didn’t fire them up. Neither did Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the thoughtful-sounding son of a Reagan-era U.S. solicitor general.
The man who got them cheering, who got them going, who got them roaring with derisive laughter..."
"Two former presidents duked it out with dueling rallies Saturday across western Pennsylvania, where they stumped for Senate candidates locked in one of the most consequential races of the cycle and offered wildly different visions of America as the final midterm fight centers on the Keystone State.
Around noon, Barack Obama rallied with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate nominee, along with Democratic candidates in local House races on the University of Pittsburgh's campus. Hours later, Donald Trump campaigned with Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz, GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug..."
"Reports That Sen. Bob Menendez (DN.J.) IS Likely to face corruption Federal Charges based on his Interactions with a key donor Invariably raise a key question:? Where IS the line drawn What's the difference Between what Menendez IS Alleged to Have Done and what the public often sees as the standard DC practice of legislators voting in ways that their donors would appreciate?
To answer that question, we spoke with Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School who works in the area of public corruption Briffault summarized the question..."
"Embattled Sen. Robert Menendez is unlikely to resign his Senate seat amid looming criminal corruption charges that he allegedly used his office to benefit a well-heeled donor, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Instead, Menendez, who has survived past scrutiny by federal prosecutors over his actions for years, plans to fight the Justice Department and clear his name, sources said. At a press conference in Newark on Friday evening, he said that he has broken no laws and made no mention of plans to step down.

"Kyle Rittenhouse could spend the next several decades of his life behind bars or soon walk free from a Wisconsin courthouse.
And pieces of paper he grabbed at random with his right hand will have played a major role in the life-turning outcome.

"The first ship carrying Ukrainian grain set out from the port of Odesa on Monday under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that is expected to release large stores of Ukrainian crops to foreign markets and ease a growing food crisis.
The Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship Razoni left Odesa carrying over 26,000 tons of corn destined for Lebanon.
“The first grain ship since Russian aggression has left port,” said Ukraine’s Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov on Twitter, posting a video of the long vessel sounding its horn..."
"The first ship carrying grain from Ukraine left a port in the southern city of Odesa Monday, after months of Russian blockade helped fuel a mounting global food crisis.
The breakthrough follows a United Nations-backed deal between Kyiv and Moscow last month and while intense fighting continues in the east and the south. The departure of the first shipment will raise hopes that the impact of the war — now five months old — might be eased for millions facing hunger and poverty across the world, though doubts over Russia's commitment to any deal will continue...."
"A frantic round of late-night negotiations on Sunday between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, moved the Senate close to a deal to stave off hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts that would begin to kick in on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the talks."
"Congressional and White House negotiators are closing in on a deal to avert across-the-board tax hikes and spending cuts that take effect at midnight, as the nation teeters on the edge of the so-called fiscal cliff.
An emerging tentative agreement would extend current tax rates for households making $450,000 or less; extend the estate tax at its current level of 35 percent for estates larger than $5 million; and prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax from hammering millions of middle-class workers, sources said.
The deal would also extend unemployment benefits set..."
"As the coronavirus pandemic continues, many people are now overthinking things they never used to think about at all. Can you go outside? What if you’re walking downwind of another person? What if you’re stuck waiting at a crosswalk and someone is there? What if you’re going for a run, and another runner is heading toward you, and the sidewalk is narrow? Suddenly, daily mundanities seem to demand strategy.
Much of this confusion stems from the shifting conversation around the pandemic. Thus far, the official line has been that the..."
"The most important new policy the government can implement to contain the spread of Covid-19 is to immediately recommend that everyone wear masks or face-coverings in public — #masksforall.
Health officials have already encouraged people to wear masks if they are showing symptoms of the disease. Particularly since 25 to 50 percent of people with the virus are asymptomatic, it would be best for everyone to be wearing a mask or face-covering when in public to protect others.
Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said..."
"A grand jury in Jefferson County, Ky., has indicted a former Louisville police detective on three charges of wanton endangerment in the first degree in the March 13 shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor. Brett Hankison, one of three officers involved, was fired by the department in June, with a termination letter saying he “wantonly and blindly” shot 10 times into Taylor’s apartment.
Taylor’s name became a rallying cry for policing overhauls and racial justice as the Black Lives Matter movement swept the United States this summer."

"A scientist who has pored over public accounts of early Covid-19 cases in China reported on Thursday that an influential World Health Organization inquiry had likely gotten the early chronology of the pandemic wrong. The new analysis suggests that the first known patient sickened with the coronavirus was a vendor in a large Wuhan animal market, not an accountant who lived many miles from it.
The report, published on Thursday in the prestigious journal Science, will revive, though certainly not settle, the debate over whether the pandemic started with a spillover..."
"The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it will cancel up to $10,000 in student debt for borrowers who earn $125,000 a year or less and up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants.
Couples who earn $250,000 a year or less and file taxes jointly will also qualify for cancellation of up to $10,000 for each partner.
The administration is also extending the payment pause on federal student loans for a final time through Dec. 31.
In a tweet, President Joe Biden said that he would provide further details on the announcement Wednesday afternoon."
"Early on Thursday morning, Donald Trump finally raised shipping limitations imposed by the Jones Act. The change—announced in a tweet by Sarah Huckabee Sanders—following the furor when Trump declared that he was putting the interest of shipping companies ahead of the lives of Americans on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
"On Thursday night, the third Democratic debate will be the first to put all the major Democratic candidates on one stage together. But among the 10 candidates, only three have been consistently registering frontrunner status in the polls: Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
And that’s been pretty consistent for several months now.
Between the two rounds — and four nights — of debates, there have been a lot of break out moments for those three and some of the other seven candidates who..."

The disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform's central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most..."
"Applications for unemployment benefits rose for the second week in a row last week, the latest sign that the nationwide surge in coronavirus cases is threatening to undermine the economic recovery.
More than 827,000 people filed first-time applications for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That was up 78,000 from a week earlier, before adjusting for seasonal patterns, and more than 100,000 from the first week of November, when weekly filings hit their lowest level since pandemic-induced layoffs began last spring.
Another 312,000 people filed for..."

Both sides presented opposing versions of the president's handling of aid for Ukraine last summer and the impeachment proceedings so far.

The impeachment managers and defense counsel are making their closing arguments for two hours each on Monday to summarize their case, starting with the House managers. The Senate is poised to acquit Trump when it takes a final vote on Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET. But there..."
"President Trump doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the most basic principle of American government: Power is divided among three branches of government. The president does not possess legislative power, yet on Saturday Trump signed a series of executive orders that were clearly in the purview of the legislative, not the executive branch."
"Joe Biden’s son Hunter is rejecting assertions by President Donald Trump and his Republican allies that he did anything wrong in engaging in foreign work in Ukraine and China.
Hunter Biden also says he failed to take into account potential implications for his father’s political career. The former vice president is a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest.
In an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday, Hunter Biden concedes he may have made a mistake “in the grand scheme of things” for failing to see the political repercussions for..."
"The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack closed its hearing on Thursday by taking a vote on whether to subpoena former President Donald Trump to testify before them.
The vote passed unanimously, with all nine members — including both Republicans — in favor.
Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., read out the motion, describing Trump's testimony as an obligation — given that more than 30 witnesses in the investigation invoked the Fifth Amendment in answer to the committee's questions about Trump, including key Trump allies Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, and John Eastman...."
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that there is a ""risk"" that US gas prices could rise again later this year, as fears grow over the possibility that Americans' wallets could be strained by a spike in prices similar to the one seen this summer.

"On Monday, the Associated Press reported that former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich would speak at the Democratic National Convention in August. For one party to dragoon a notable from the other side into endorsing its presidential candidate is hardly unprecedented. And most of the time, it makes no difference.
But, every now and then, a partisan defector perfectly amplifies the message his endorsee is trying to send. Joe Biden is running against an incumbent who appears largely unperturbed by the death of 140,000 of his..."
"Conservatives are always looking for converts, the old saying goes, while liberals are always looking for heretics. This would explain why so many of each are so angry right now. Joe Biden’s campaign has attracted the support of a small clique of Republican converts: the Lincoln Project, a boutique collection of anti-Trump Republicans, as well as former Ohio governor John Kasich, who confirmed yesterday he will endorse Biden at the Democratic convention.
It’s no surprise conservatives are furious. Anti-anti-Trump conservative Dan McLaughlin argues in National Review that the defectors have..."
"The family of a young woman who died in Iran after she was accused of a dress code violation and arrested by the country's ""morality police"" have told CBS News she was tortured and killed in police custody. Mahsa Amini's death sparked protests that have raged across Iran for 11 days against the country's ruling Muslim clerics, with more than 75 people killed in the unrest according to one monitoring group.
With defiance and despair, family, friends and neighbors came in their thousands last week to bury 22-year-old Amini.

Tyson wrote “On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642.” The tweet set off an Internet firestorm and was retweeted nearly 15,000 times in less than an hour."
"Only recently have I come to accept Christmas as a secular holiday. Because of my religious awakening in high school and the subsequent falling out I had with God in college, its symbols and stories were too freighted with meaning for me just to enjoy the pretty colors.

A rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
During that call, Trump asks Zelensky to speak with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and suggests..."
"On Thursday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson caused an uproar by promoting the racist, anti-Semitic, patriarchal and conspiratorial “white replacement theory.” Also known as the “great replacement theory,” it stands on the premise that nonwhite immigrants are being imported (sometimes the Jewish community is accused of orchestrating this) to replace white people and white voters. The theory is also an inherent chastisement of white women for having a lower birthrate than nonwhite women."
"The Department of Homeland Security runs out of money at midnight Friday. The Senate is on track to pass a bill to fully fund DHS with no strings attached. Meanwhile, the House will be voting Friday on a stop-gap spending bill to fund the department for only three weeks. House Republicans say it's to give the two chambers more time to work out differences. But Senate Democrats say that's not going to happen."
"A New York judge Wednesday tossed the real estate fraud case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance against Paul Manafort, ruling that the charges violated the state’s double jeopardy laws.
Vance's office accused Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, of falsifying business records to obtain millions of dollars in residential mortgage loans in a scam that began in December 2015 and continued until three days before Trump's 2017 inauguration.
But Justice Maxwell Wiley of the New York County Supreme Court dismissed the case because Manafort, 70, had been..."
"The right-wing web is buzzing about the recently released anti-trans documentary What is a Woman? from Daily Wire columnist Matt Walsh. Everyone else seems to be ignoring it. And while I don’t fault the many film critics who allegedly declined to review the film, I decided to run toward the dumpster fire. Ignorance can indeed be frightening, but it must be confronted.
The propaganda project garnered push back even before its June 1 release, when trans activist Eli Erlick accused Walsh of seeking interviews under false pretenses. Erlick, who is a founder of the Trans..."
"The muddled race to secure the Democratic nomination for US president enters a new phase this weekend as voters in the western state of Nevada gather to show their preference for one of the seven candidates still in the race.

"— President Obama has settled on Ashton B. Carter to be the next defense secretary, senior administration officials said on Tuesday, but is not prepared to announce the move because the White House has not completed its vetting of him.
A former deputy defense secretary with a long history at the Pentagon — though no uniformed military service — Mr. Carter was on a short list of prospective defense secretaries from the moment that Chuck Hagel announced his resignation, under pressure, on Nov. 24.
Mr. Obama is not expected to..."
"Progressives are once again threatening to tank their party's infrastructure bill ahead of a key deadline, with President Joe Biden's domestic agenda on the line. This time Democratic leaders believe they have a secret weapon: Biden himself.
Biden will join House Democrats on Capitol Hill Thursday morning for a high-stakes sales pitch to resistant progressives, asking them to support a bipartisan infrastructure framework, although a final agreement on the party's broader social spending bill remains out of reach without clear liberal buyin.
But even as Biden sandwiched the Hill visit and follow-up..."
"When moderate Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan was defeated in Tuesday’s primary, condemnation came swiftly. Not for John Gibbs, the far-right election conspiracist who narrowly beat Meijer, but for Democratic Party officials who boosted Gibbs’s campaign in an attempt to face a general election opponent who would be easier to beat in a district that leans slightly Democratic.
Gibbs is one of a number of such candidates Democrats have tried to help, and the response has been widespread outrage. Outside of the Democratic officials who made the decision to deploy this tactic, there seems to..."
"French president praises multilateralism of Nato and EU while offering gratitude to US
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has appealed directly to Donald Trump to fulfil the “promise of Normandy” by embracing pillars of the postwar peace such as the European Union and Nato as the two leaders marked the D-day landings 75 years ago.
In a speech that trod a fine diplomatic line, Macron offered both sincere expressions of gratitude for the valour of US troops in the second world war and vehement calls for the White House to re-engage..."

"Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders who she accused of dragging their feet on legislation to ban stock trading by lawmakers.
Spanberger, who introduced a bill with Republican Representative Chip Roy to require that lawmakers place investment assets into a blind trust while in office, questioned Pelosi’s commitment to a stock-trading ban and called the delay in acting on any reform bill before the House leaves for a break “a failure of House leadership.”"
"Shake Shack plans to return a $10 million loan it received under an emergency small business rescue program, amid a growing backlash against big businesses that got the money before $350 billion in funding lapsed last week.

"For days, a convoy of truckers has blocked the roads that serve the Port of Oakland, crippling a major West Coast cargo hub already hampered by global supply chain disruptions.
The protest is meant to send a message to Gov. Gavin Newsom: Keep the drivers clear of a California labor law that they say threatens their livelihood.
The truckers, primarily independent owners and operators, are demonstrating in opposition to Assembly Bill 5, a law passed in 2019 that requires gig workers in several industries to be classified as employees with benefits,..."

"Donald Trump’s acceptance speech hit the mark Thursday night, drawing accolades from a number of GOP political insiders who had doubted his competence to lead the Republican ticket this fall.
That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of operatives, activists and strategists in 11 battleground states surveyed immediately following Trump’s speech. Fifty-six percent of Republican insiders said Trump’s speech — a forceful indictment of those responsible for what he perceives as a country in decline, along with an assurance that he is uniquely qualified to solve the..."
"Former President Donald Trump must answer questions under oath in New York state’s civil investigation into his business practices, a judge ruled Thursday.
Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump and his two eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., to comply with subpoenas issued in December by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Trump and his two children must sit for depositions within 21 days, Engoron said following a two-hour hearing with lawyers for the Trumps and James’ office."
"Hillary Clinton sat down Friday for a rare national television interview, a move that could have allowed her to sail into the holiday weekend, reclaiming a bad week of headlines about the vexing email scandal that has overshadowed her campaign and unsettled even ardent supporters.
It didn't quite work out that way.
During the sitdown with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell -- replete with gauzy lighting -- Clinton mostly made news for refusing to directly apologize for her exclusive use of a private email account and server while she was..."
"Hillary Rodham Clinton and her family personally paid a State Department staffer to maintain the private e-mail server she used while heading the agency, according to an official from Clinton’s presidential campaign.
The unusual arrangement helped Clinton retain personal control over the system that she used for her public and private duties and that has emerged as an issue for her campaign. But, according to the campaign official, it also ensured that taxpayer dollars were not spent on a private server that was shared by Clinton, her husband and their..."
"President Biden offered a defiant defense on Monday of his decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, returning to the White House from a weekend at Camp David amid chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport following the collapse of the Afghanistan government to the Taliban.
Speaking to the American people from the ornate East Room, Mr. Biden stood by his decision to end the longest war in United States history and rejected criticism from allies and adversaries about the events of the weekend that left hundreds of Afghans desperately running after military planes..."

Latest figures from Johns Hopkins University showed that the number of people killed by the virus is now 250,180.
The news comes amid record infections across the US, with the Trump administration repeatedly failing to get a grip on the Covid-19 crisis. Most recently Trump has refused to concede he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden who this..."

"Pfizer and BioNTech are officially asking the Biden administration to authorize the use of their COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11.
Pfizer tweeted on Thursday that the companies had submitted their formal request for Emergency Use Authorization of the vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he supports the impeachment of President Trump.
“With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry,” Biden said during a campaign event in Rochester, N.H. “He’s already convicted himself.
“In full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts,” Biden continued, drawing applause. “To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden called for President Trump's impeachment and removal from office, on Wednesday.
Up until now, Biden had reserved judgment, saying he supported the House's impeachment inquiry and wanted to see what the facts showed.
But in a campaign speech in Rochester, N.H., Biden was unequivocal, saying that ""to preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, [Trump] should be impeached.""
Biden said the case was already clear before the public.
""With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice, refusing to..."
"President Donald Trump made another play to his base Friday, declaring churches and houses of worship ""essential"" and sharply warning the nation's governors that he would ""override"" any actions they take that interfere with the resumption of religious services.
It was a move meant to shore up the support of his core supporters at a time when Trump's reelection prospects look uncertain in the midst of declining approval of his handling of the virus and the economic meltdown. Adding fuel to the latest controversy on the right -- just as..."
"President Donald Trump demanded on Friday that states allow houses of worship to reopen from stay-at-home restrictions imposed to combat the coronavirus outbreak, yet his authority to override governors’ orders is restrained by constitutional limits.
“The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now,” Trump said Friday in a statement to reporters at the White House. “For this weekend.”
“If they don’t do it I will override the governors,” he added.
Trump cited no legal grounds that would..."
"Even as China boasts of getting the coronavirus outbreak under control, the number of asymptomatic cases has risen, according to health officials where the pandemic began late last year.
The National Health Commission reported Monday that 78 new asymptomatic cases have been recorded in China in the past 24 hours, up from 47 a day earlier.
More than 1,000 asymptomatic cases are still under “medical observation,” the NHC said."
"At least one-third of the world is under some type of lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, as governments urge social distancing to stymie the virus' spread.
That's because the COVID-19 virus is insidious.
""There's significant transmission by people not showing symptoms,"" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told Business Insider."
"President Joe Biden said Monday he believes a recession in the US is not inevitable but acknowledged the economic pain that Americans are feeling amid high inflation, supply chain shortages and the geopolitical earthquake caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The President argued the US has made ""significant progress"" in its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which he said has put America in a better position than other countries around the globe struggling with the same issues. But he predicted it would take time to fully recover, saying, ""This is going to be a..."
"The grim work of search, rescue and recovery spun into a second day Tuesday in central Oklahoma after a massive and murderous tornado blasted through the area, killing at least 24 people, flattening neighborhoods and destroying two elementary schools.
There was a strand of good news Tuesday: Authorities dramatically reduced the confirmed death toll after earlier reporting that at least 51 people had died."
"The state medical examiner's office has revised the death toll from a tornado in an Oklahoma City suburb to 24 people, including seven children.
Spokeswoman Amy Elliot said Tuesday morning that she believes some victims were counted twice in the early chaos of the storm. Authorities said initially that as many as 51 people were dead, including 20 children.
Teams are continuing to search the rubble in Moore, 10 miles south of Oklahoma City, after the Monday afternoon tornado.
The deadly storm touched down on Monday late afternoon, wreaking..."
"Ten GOP senators are needed to join all 50 Democrats in order to overcome a legislative filibuster in support of the House-passed bill to codify same-sex marriage into federal law. CNN asked all 50 Republicans where they stand on the legislation.
It's not yet clear how many Republicans will support the bill, but GOP and Democratic senators said Wednesday they expect it could eventually win the 60 votes needed.
Here's what we found:
Four Republican senators, so far, have either said they will support or will likely support the House-passed same-sex marriage bill, and..."
"Each year, presidents invite broadcast and cable news anchors for an off-the-record lunch the afternoon of the State of the Union address.
This year, President Donald Trump excluded CNN from the lunch, the network reported Monday night. According to Brian Stelter, while Trump has maintained the traditional lunch and will host one this year — despite his campaign of performative animosity towards the media — the White House has not invited any anchors from CNN.
“This is the first time in recent memory that a president has singled out one..."
"Russia launched missile strikes near an airport in Lviv on Friday, a strategic Ukrainian city not far from the Polish border that had until now largely been spared from the relentless bombardment witnessed across much of the country during the war.
Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant, but that work at the facility had stopped before the strikes and there were no reports of casualties.
Ukraine's armed forces say initial information suggests Russia launched six missiles towards the Lviv on Friday morning. It says the missiles were most likely..."
"SACRAMENTO — California announced Thursday it will impose a mandatory overnight stay-at-home order for much of the state as COVID-19 surged to unprecedented levels and hard-hit Los Angeles County careened toward even more severe lockdown measures.
While the coronavirus is surging across the state, the situation in Los Angeles County was quickly reaching crisis levels, with nearly 5,000 new coronavirus cases Thursday, the most it has seen in any one day since the pandemic began.
Moreover, California set another record for most coronavirus cases in a single day Thursday. An..."
"Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a speech that was at times sweeping and at times policy laden, delivered on Saturday a pointed repudiation of Republican economic policies and a populist promise to reverse the gaping gulf between the rich and poor at her biggest campaign event to date.
Under sunny skies and surrounded by flag-waving supporters on Roosevelt Island in New York, Mrs. Clinton pledged to run an inclusive campaign and to create a more inclusive economy, saying"
It’s difficult to count all the ways Trump remade the game: the huckster came off more real than the scripted political pros. The cable-news addict made pollsters look like chumps. The fabulist out-shouted journalists fighting to separate fact from falsehood. The demagogue won more Latino and black votes than the 2012 Republican nominee.
"President Donald Trump unveiled new guidelines on Thursday meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions, but in a retreat from his onetime claim of ""absolute authority"" to restart the economy, he told governors on an afternoon telephone call it was their decision on when and how to reopen.
""You are going to call your own shots,"" Trump said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. ""I've gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I've known and some very well. You are all very capable..."
"After a federal judge said New York could implement gun restrictions passed after the US supreme court struck down a century-old law, the state attorney general saluted “a victory in our efforts to protect New Yorkers”.
“Responsible gun control measures save lives and any attempts by the gun lobby to tear down New York’s sensible gun control laws will be met with fierce defense of the law,” Letitia James said on Wednesday night.
In June, in the aftermath of mass shootings at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas and a..."
"Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. has signed a deal with a U.N.-backed group to allow other manufacturers to make its experimental COVID-19 pill, a move that could make the treatment available to more than half of the world’s population.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Pfizer said it would grant a license for the antiviral pill to the Geneva-based Medicines Patent Pool, which would let generic drug companies produce the pill for use in 95 countries, making up about 53% of the world’s population.
The deal excludes some large countries that have suffered..."
"Pfizer announced a deal on Tuesday to allow its promising Covid-19 treatment to be made and sold inexpensively in 95 poorer nations that are home to more than half of the world’s population.
The agreement follows a similar arrangement negotiated by Merck last month, and together the deals have the potential to vastly expand global production of two simple antiviral pills that could alter the course of the pandemic by preventing severe illness from the coronavirus.

"Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' victory early on Thursday, the end of a long day and night marked by chaos and violence in Washington, in which extremists emboldened by President Trump sought to thwart the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of modern American history by staging a violent insurrection inside the U.S. Capitol.
""To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,"" Vice President Mike Pence said, once lawmakers reconvened after many spent hours in lockdown. ""Violence..."
"President Donald Trump committed to ""an orderly transition"" of power Thursday minutes after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden's election win.
The striking reversal came hours after a violent mob of the president's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.
""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,"" according to a statement attributed to Trump and released by the White House.
Trump has repeatedly and baselessly claimed that the election was stolen or that..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration reported a river of red ink Friday.
The federal deficit for the 2019 budget year surged 26% from 2018 to $984.4 billion — its highest point in seven years. The gap is widely expected to top $1 trillion in the current budget year and likely remain there for the next decade.
The year-over-year widening in the deficit reflected such factors as revenue lost from the 2017 Trump tax cut and a budget deal that added billions in spending for military and domestic programs."
"The U.S. government’s budget deficit ballooned to nearly $1 trillion in 2019, the Treasury Department announced Friday, as the United States’ fiscal imbalance widened for a fourth consecutive year despite a sustained run of economic growth. The deficit grew $205 billion, or 26 percent, in the past year.
The country’s worsening fiscal picture runs in sharp contrast to President Trump’s campaign promise to eliminate the federal debt within eight years. The deficit is up nearly 50 percent in the Trump era. Since taking office, Trump has endorsed big spending increases..."
"Early Monday morning, residents of Kyiv described the inescapable, dystopian buzz of Iranian-made Shahed-136s attack drones—which fly low into the city, weaving around buildings and carrying precision missiles that prove impossible to stop.
The so-called kamikaze drones are a precise weapon shot from flatbed trucks—which leaves them vulnerable to anti-aircraft missiles as they are deployed, but they are stealthy enough to cause major damage once inside city limits. The horrifying buzzing is almost always followed by the sort of loud explosions that rocked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday morning, killing several,..."
"The borough of South Plainfield, New Jersey, abruptly canceled its Labor Day parade and other festivities Monday over a “security concern.”
Police told ABC7 New York that numerous small explosive devices were found on private property near the parade route, prompting the decision. The devices were discovered during an investigation unrelated to the parade and don’t appear to have been placed there in connection with the parade."
"What's worse: no presidential debate at all or separate and unequal events staged at exactly the same time with a media outlet putting both thumbs on the scale to favor one candidate over the other?
We will probably find out Thursday night. NBC's recent decision to stage a town hall with President Donald Trump at the exact time of the already scheduled town hall on ABC with Joe Biden is the latest example of a media organization ignoring the best interests of the voting public in favor of its own.

"The U.S. accused WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of taking part in a computer-hacking conspiracy related to the disclosure of diplomatic cables extracted by former U.S. Army analyst Chelsea Manning.
In a March 2018 indictment unsealed on Thursday just hours after Assange’s arrest in London, the U.S. accused Assange of assisted Manning in “hacking a password stored on United States Department of Defense computers,” according to the indictment. Assange’s anti-secrecy organization published the cables starting in 2010.
Assange’s arrest came after Ecuador expelled him from its embassy there. The 47-year-old has..."
"US justice department alleges that Assange conspired with Chelsea Manning to break into a secret Pentagon computer network
Julian Assange has been charged by the US government with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, according to an indictment released soon after the WikiLeaks founder’s arrest in London.
The US justice department alleged that Assange conspired with Chelsea Manning in 2010 to break into a secret Pentagon computer network in order to obtain classified documents that Assange’s site published.
Assange faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted.

"The explosive New York Times report on Donald Trump’s tax returns confirms a great number of things about the president’s finances we’ve only been able to speculate about for years. We now know that Trump really was telling the truth when he claimed, beginning in the 2016 presidential campaign, that he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (though such an audit would not prevent him from releasing his returns—that part he really did make up). We also now know—though we basically already did—that while Trump made a lot..."
"The U.S. Senate on Saturday acquitted former President Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection.
The acquittal comes more than a month after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers were counting the electoral results that certified Trump's loss. Five people died in the riot, including a police officer. Two other officers later killed themselves.
A majority of senators voted to convict Trump — 57 to 43, including seven Republicans. But two-thirds, or 67 votes, was needed to convict. It was the second..."
"Senate Republicans voted against convicting Donald Trump Saturday for inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol Jan. 6, bringing a swift end to the former president’s second impeachment trial after Democrats abandoned plans to call witnesses in the face of GOP opposition.
Seven Republicans joined Democrats in a 57-43 vote in favor of conviction, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump in the Senate. Republican Sens. Richard Burr (N.C.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Patrick Toomey..."
"Jeffrey Epstein’s estate was sued by a woman who says he raped her when she was a teenager, the first case against his estate under a New York law taking effect Wednesday that gives victims of sexual abuse a year to file lawsuits over older claims.
The case was filed in state court in Manhattan by Jennifer Araoz, who says Epstein targeted her when she was a New York City high school student. The same law is behind dozens of suits that were also filed against the Archdiocese of New..."
"Now I’m suing his estate and accomplices.
The first time I stepped into Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion on the Upper East Side in the fall of 2001, I noticed his security cameras. They were hard to miss. Inside the front door, he had small TVs playing the footage in real time. I was a child, just 14 at the time. But the message was clear: I was in the house of someone important and I was being watched.
I can still remember watching myself on those screens as I walked into..."
"The Democratic Party will take control of Congress for the first time in a decade, after Democrats the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won their Senate runoffs in Georgia, CNN projected Wednesday.
The election results have provoked whiplash in Washington, which saw Republicans in November make gains in the House and hold onto Senate control.
But now Georgia gives President-elect Joe Biden the power to push through Cabinet nominations without Republican support and potentially enact sweeping, liberal legislation.
A new debate over Biden's agenda is already beginning following Warnock's..."
"A huge surge in voting by mail is coming whether states prepare for it or not — and without clear direction from the federal government, states are preparing to muscle through their own changes to get ready for the glut of mail ballots coming their way in November.
Wisconsin’s conflict-ridden April 7 elections went off without the state government making any major policy changes to encourage absentee voting, but more than two-thirds of voters cast their votes via the mail anyway, many times higher than the 12 percent absentee voting..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans’ support for mail-in voting has jumped amid concerns about the safety of polling places during the coronavirus pandemic, but a wide partisan divide suggests President Donald Trump’s public campaign against vote by mail may be resonating with his Republican backers.
A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds Democrats are now much more likely than Republicans to support their state conducting elections exclusively by mail, 47% to 29%.
In 2018, about half as many Democrats were in favor, and there was..."
"The Senate just voted to advance Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in a critical test of support.
A final confirmation vote is expected Saturday.
Republican Sens. Jeff Flake and Susan Collins supported the motion, as did Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who had been undecided.
GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted no."
"When the latest data on consumer prices in the United States landed Wednesday, the headline number was ugly.
Inflation surged to 9.1% in June, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was higher than economists polled by Refinitiv were forecasting.
It was also much higher than the 8.6% rate logged in May, which rattled financial markets and pushed the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates more aggressively — renewing fears about whether the central bank could tame inflation without triggering a recession.
Investors were bracing for a surprise. But there’s reason to..."
"Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans have decided to create a select committee to expand their investigation into the Benghazi attacks.
Beyond that, nothing is settled. In fact, Republicans may be going on something of a mission improbable to yield new information and turn up new clues in a wide-ranging probe that has already spanned 13 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents and 50 briefings."
"As widely expected, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Monday announced that Rep. Trey Gowdy will lead a newly-formed select committee to investigate the State Department's handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya.
""Trey Gowdy is as dogged, focused, and serious-minded as they come. His background as a federal prosecutor and his zeal for the truth make him the ideal person to lead this panel,"" Bo"
"Friday’s jobs report came in strong: the US economy added 261,000 new jobs in October, blowing away analyst expectations of 200,000, even as unemployment ticked up to 3.7%.
But don’t let the jobs boom lull you into a false sense of employment security. Job cuts and pauses on hiring are beginning to flow across the tech sector, which boasts some of the most valuable companies in the world. That’s bad news for the economy as a whole.
What’s happening: Tech companies are announcing an alarming number of layoffs and hiring freezes."
"Baby formula has been running low all over the United States, threatening the health of infants and other people who depend on it for their sustenance.
Experts say this is the worst formula shortage in decades. It’s also the latest example of how the US health system’s failures consistently fall hardest on people with complex medical conditions and people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged."
"The mayor of Portland, Oregon, and President Donald Trump engaged in a real-time argument Sunday as the president sent a flurry of critical tweets about Ted Wheeler as the mayor was holding a press conference about the fatal shooting of a right-wing supporter in his city the night before.
After Trump called Wheeler, a Democrat, a “fool” and blamed him for allowing violence to proliferate in the liberal city, the visibly angry mayor lashed out at the president, addressing him in the first person through the TV cameras."
"Christopher Anderson, a career foreign service officer in the State Department, will tell House impeachment investigators on Wednesday that President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani stood in the way of the White House strengthening ties with Ukraine, according to a copy of Anderson's opening statement obtained by NPR.
Anderson, who spent five years working on Washington-Kyiv relations, will describe a meeting he had with former national security adviser John Bolton on the topic of having senior White House officials engage more with Ukraine. In it, Bolton noted a possible hitch...."
"Two career diplomats were testifying before House impeachment investigators Wednesday that President Trump displayed a deeply pessimistic view of Ukraine that was out of step with officials at the White House and State Department who saw support for the European country as critical in its battle with Russian-backed separatists, according to their prepared remarks obtained by The Washington Post.
The State Department officials, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, said their optimistic view of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky clashed with a darker outlook of the new government held by Trump and..."
"Following four years of border crackdowns, endless legal fights and racially charged rhetoric by President Trump, immigration advocates had hopes that the new Democratic administration would bring a more compassionate and open-armed approach to immigration, particularly toward asylum seekers fleeing troubled Central America.
But when Vice President Kamala Harris gave a high-profile speech Monday in Guatemala, in which she told would-be immigrants from Central America “do not come” to the United States, her words instantly provoked ripples of anger and concern among immigrant rights groups and progressives."
"The good news is, the U.S. economy continues to add new jobs and slowly recover from the brutal losses from earlier this year. The bad news is, we still have a long way to go.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its report for August this morning.
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 1.4 million in August, and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. These improvements in the labor market reflect the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed..."
"The U.S. unemployment rate fell sharply in August to 8.4% from 10.2% even as hiring slowed, with employers adding the fewest jobs since the pandemic began.
Employers added 1.4 million jobs, the Labor Department said, down from 1.7 million in July. The U.S. economy has recovered about half the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic.
Friday’s report added to evidence that nearly six months after the coronavirus paralyzed the country, the economy is mounting only a fitful recovery. From small businesses to hotels, restaurants, airlines and entertainment venues, a..."
"Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours.
Adding to already overwhelmed telephone systems, the state issued last-minute directives that said callers needed to reach a live person in order to apply for aid.
Nonprofits across the state selected to distribute the money..."
"California is rolling out a program on Monday that will give $500 cash payments to unauthorized immigrants shut out of traditional government aid programs because of their immigration status.
The New York Times reported the $75 million taxpayer-funded program funded will be conducted by phone to reduce in-person contacts. It's expected to distribute cash to 150,000 people and the maximum amount awarded per household is $1,000.

"File under “silly” the movement to force the rebranding of the day late-19th-century Italian-Americans christened to celebrate their heritage. They chose as their hero Cristoforo Colombo, the Italian explorer who, sailing for the Spanish crown, on Oct. 12, 1492, made landfall in what was then called the New World. Whatever one thinks of Columbus’ character — you won’t find a reflexive defense of him in this column — the man and his continent-connecting achievement unmistakably shaped world history.
It would be blind to that history to deem the name so..."
"Redistricting season officially kicks off with the release of detailed population data from the U.S. Census Bureau that will be used to redraw voting districts nationwide — potentially helping determine control of the U.S. House in the 2022 elections and providing an electoral edge for the next decade.
The new data being released Thursday will show which counties, cities and neighborhoods gained or lost the most people in the 2020 census. That will serve as the building block to redraw 429 U.S. House districts in 44 states and 7,383 state..."

The secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also focused on what import Russia’s potential use of any chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine could hold for NATO, saying that such use would “fundamentally change the nature of the conflict.” And he upped the rhetoric on China’s role in bringing the..."
"Herschel Walker, the football legend now running for Senate in Georgia, says he wants to completely ban abortion, likening it to murder and claiming there should be “no exception” for rape, incest, or the life of the mother.

A woman who asked not to be identified out of privacy concerns told The Daily Beast that after she and Walker conceived a child while they were dating in 2009 he urged her to get an abortion. The woman said she..."
"This is a glorious week indeed for Kim Jong Un’s dwindling little family business in Pyongyang. Finally, finally—to be taken seriously. To get people to pay attention and not laugh at the same time (not too much, anyway). The North Korean regime—which is to say three generations of Kims—has spent its entire, bizarre existence on earth trying to get people to notice them. And rarely succeeding, at least since the Korean War ended 61 years ago. It can hardly be an accident that the very thing that apparently set the..."

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hiring in the United States jumped in February as employers added 273,000 jobs, evidence that the economy was in strong shape before the coronavirus began to sweep through the nation.
The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% last month, matching a 50-year low, down from 3.6% in January.
The monthly job gain comes from a survey of payrolls in the second week of February, predating the viral outbreak. So far, there are few signs that the job market has been affected by..."

"As we reported late Friday, the House managed to approve a one-week extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which President Obama signed. The passage capped a day of scrambling that saw a longer three-week stopgap shot down in the House.
But the thorny issue that has weighed on a longer-term funding bill — an insistence by Republicans that it include a push-back on the president's executive action on immigration — is still in the air. And the clock is ticking on the fresh deadline to resolve the..."
"Republicans vowing to govern effectively as a congressional majority failed a fundamental test Friday, when House leaders only narrowly managed to avert a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security after an embarrassing defeat earlier in the day.
The seven-day funding extension, approved by a vote of 357 to 60, came just hours before money for the department was to run out at midnight. The accord was reached after a stunning and humiliating setback for Speaker John A. Boehner and his leadersh"
"The U.S. lost 701,000 jobs in March, breaking a remarkable string of uninterrupted payrolls gains the past decade and revealing just the leading edge of the coronavirus-triggered hurricane that's upending America’s economy and labor market.
The unemployment rate jumped to 4.4% from a 50-year low of 3.5%, the Labor Department said Friday.
The report reflects employers’ jitters early in the month over the unprecedented economic fallout from the pandemic. But it doesn’t capture the nearly 10 million laid-off and furloughed Americans who filed initial jobless claims the past two weeks..."
"The U.S. economy lost a total of 701,000 jobs in March, bringing a record 10-year streak of employment gains to a halt as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hammer the workforce and shatter economic growth.
The closely watched monthly jobs data, released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, also shows the unemployment rate soared to 4.4 percentfrom 3.5 percent, after months at a half-century low.
March's data represents the tip of the iceberg, however, since the survey was conducted in the first half of the month, prior to the..."
"With only about 14,000 votes separating President-elect Joe Biden and President Donald Trump in battleground Georgia, the state is heading into a recount of presidential votes.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who is a Republican, said on Wednesday the state will recount presidential election results in each county by hand due to the close margin.
On Wednesday, Biden was up by less than 0.3% of the nearly 5 million votes cast in Georgia. On Saturday, he was declared winner of the presidential election as some states continued to count..."
"Election officials in Georgia announced a recount on Friday after the presidential race was deemed “too close to call” in that state.
Joe Biden overtook Donald Trump in Georgia, historically a Republican stronghold, at around 4.30am ET to secure a lead of 1,579 votes.
Trump and Biden were locked in a tight contest on Friday, with the Democrat edging ahead, to get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. For Trump, Georgia is a state he must win.
But with such a razor-thin margin, Georgia’s secretary of state,..."

"Veteran International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound told USA TODAY Sports on Monday afternoon that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games are going to be postponed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,” Pound said in a phone interview. “The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.”
Pound, a Canadian who has been one of the most influential members of the IOC for decades, said the..."
"ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED JANUARY 2021: In the months leading up to the November election, the social media platform Parler attracted millions of new users by promising something competitors, increasingly, did not: unfettered free speech. “If you can say it on the streets of New York,” promised the company’s chief executive, John Matze, in a June CNBC interview, “you can say it on Parler.”
The giants of social media — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram — had more stringent rules. And while they still amplified huge amounts of far-right content, they had started..."
"After years of behind-the-scenes meetings between LGBT advocates and top Mormon leaders, church officials Tuesday announced for the first time general support for legislation to protect LGBT people in areas such as housing and employment – as long as accommodations are made to protect the freedom of religious people who oppose such measures.
“We must all learn to live with others who do not share the same beliefs or values,” read a statement released at a midday Salt Lake City news conference."
"In a landmark move, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Tuesday that it is changing its posture toward gays. The church has decided to support anti-discrimination legislation for gays and lesbians in the realm of housing and employment. The church also announced that it it comes with the condition that no one can be forced to perform actions if he or she has religious objections. One example, a doctor who refuses to artificially inseminate a lesbian couple. Utah is facing two bills that protections for each group...."
"Former Florida governor Jeb Bush now leads the field of Republican candidates for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination, but former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton enjoys a decided advantage over Bush and other potential GOP rivals in hypothetical general election matchups, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
At this early stage in the 2016 competition, the prospective candidates suffer from image weaknesses, but the Republicans have a more acute problem. Most Republicans are not well known, but at this point, not a single one of six Republicans..."
"The Justice Department on Monday announced indictments of six Russian military intelligence officers in connection with major hacks worldwide, including of the Winter Olympics and elections in France as well as an attack in 2017 aimed at destabilizing Ukraine that spread rapidly and was blamed for billions of dollars in damage.
Prosecutors said the suspects were from the same Russian unit that conducted one of the Kremlin’s major operations to interfere in the 2016 American election: the theft of Democratic emails. They attacked the 2017 French presidential elections; targeted British..."
"Ninety-nine days ago, Volodymyr Zelensky left the presidential palace in Kyiv to shoot a selfie video outside in the street.
The previous day, President Vladimir Putin had sent his troops into Ukraine and the Ukrainian leader was coming under Western pressure to save himself and evacuate the capital before the massive column of Russian armor reached the city.
But no, Zelensky said, Ukraine will fight and he would stay. “I need ammo, not a ride,” he declared.
It was a line that passed immediately into history and helped steel a nation to defend itself against a..."
"On Feb. 29, 2012, Mitt Romney finally retook the lead in Real Clear Politics' average of polling of the Republican nomination contest that year for the final time. Months of ups and downs, and -- four years ago Monday -- Romney finally had a clear path to the nomination. In the 2004 Democratic and 2008 Democratic and Republican contests as well, the person leading on Feb. 29 in the polling average went on to win his party's nomination."
"Former President Donald Trump’s Facebook account should remain suspended, the company’s oversight board announced Wednesday while leaving the door open to his possible return down the line.
The decision comes nearly four months after Facebook suspended Trump’s account over fears he might incite additional violence following the Jan. 6. attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Facebook has said the board’s decision would be binding.
The board upheld Facebook's decision to suspend Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, but it criticized the social network..."
"COVID-19 is sending mixed messages. The U.S. is recording over 800,000 cases a day for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, and hospitalizations are also setting records. 
But New York State recorded only about 48,000 cases on Friday, almost a 47% drop from the previous week’s case count, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday.
""We are turning the corner on the winter surge, but we're not through this yet,"" the governor said in a statement.
Minnesota also saw declining intensive-care hospitalizations for COVID-19, and cases have been falling in Washington..."
"Legal wrangling over abortions in Texas took a further twist late Friday, after the state Supreme Court blocked a lower court order issued just days earlier that had temporarily allowed the procedures to resume.
The Texas Supreme Court in Austin granted an “emergency motion for temporary relief” that was filed Wednesday by the state’s attorney general, Republican Ken Paxton, staying a temporary restraining order that had been granted earlier this week by a judge in Harris County. A further state Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for later this month.
Texas has left a nearly century-old..."
"Decades ago I helped organize a conference that brought together vaccine skeptics and public health officials. The debate centered on what governments can and cannot demand from citizens, and what behaviors one can rightly expect from others.
It took place many years before the current coronavirus pandemic, but many things that happened at that conference remind me of our circumstances today. Not least, as a political theorist who also studies social ethics, it reminds me that arguments grounded in self-interest can often be correct – but still deeply inadequate.
I recall..."
"After months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well-financed liberal opponent, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday won a series of primaries that freed her to present herself as the de facto victor of the Democratic nominating fight, and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the November election."
"The numbers are not directly comparable to previous weeks because of a change the Labor Department made in how it calculates the claims.
More than 880,000 people filed new applications for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.
The numbers are not directly comparable to previous weeks because of a change the Labor Department made in how it calculates the claims, which are seasonally adjusted. The number appears lower than the previous week’s 1 million claims, but that reflects a change in the Labor Department’s methodology rather..."
"The US economy added 379,000 jobs last month, far more than economists had expected, signaling the labor market recovery is finally gaining steam.
The January numbers were also revised sharply higher to 166,000 added jobs versus 49,000 initially reported.
The leisure and hospitality industry added the most jobs in February with 355,000 new positions as some restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 were rolled back. The sector is still recovering from a rough winter, adding back positions that were lost rather than creating new jobs.
The unemployment..."
"For the past several years, comedian Dave Chappelle has been locked in a vicious cycle of anti-cancel-culture standup comedy. Over six Netflix specials, Chappelle has lashed out at what he views as progressive attempts to cancel him for his incendiary comedy — all while mocking the queer and transgender communities and the Me Too movement and generally doubling, tripling, and sextupling down on the offensive jokes and reactionary politics that people took issue with in the first place.
It’s a fatiguing ouroboros.
Chappelle’s latest special The Closer is possibly his last for the streaming service,..."
"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down nearly 1,861.81 points, or 6.9%. The S&P 500 slid 5.9% Thursday and the Nasdaq fell 5.3%. It's the biggest decline for the three major averages since March 16, when they all fell more than 11% as it became obvious that the coronavirus would have dramatic effects on everyday life.
Markets have surged in recent weeks even in the face of dire economic markers as investors optimistically eyed phased economic reopenings nationwide. All 50 states had begun reopening nonessential businesses by the end of..."
"The world was facing up to a new phase in the Ukraine crisis on Tuesday, with Kyiv bracing for a potential conflict with Russia and the West moving to impose sanctions on Moscow.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognizing their independence Monday, threatening a major escalation following months of military buildup and warnings from the West that the Kremlin was trying to create a pretext to invade its neighbor. 
Moscow drew swift international condemnation, with the U.S. now calling the move an “invasion,” two Biden administration officials told NBC News.
Washington and its..."
"Democrats laid plans Friday for impeaching President Donald Trump, even as he’s headed out of the White House, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had spoken to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about preventing an “unhinged” Trump from ordering a nuclear strike in his final hours and days.
Pelosi and the Democrats are considering swift impeachment — as soon as next week — in response to the deadly siege of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob that shocked the nation and the world
“We must take..."
"For fans of political blood sport, tonight’s Republican primary debate in Cleveland didn’t disappoint. Donald Trump quickly abandoned his promise not to throw punches, Chris Christie brought “a little Jersey” in a testy exchange with Rand Paul and Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, and Marco Rubio staked out staunchly pro-life position in response to questions about abortion. Now, the members of the chattering class will turn their attention to what the debate means for the future of the 2016 race."
"Winning a primary debate isn’t about having the best one-liners or drawing the biggest applause.
For top candidates, it’s an audition for party elites, moneyed supporters and, secondarily, voters. The goal isn’t to wow the crowd or surge in the polls, but to reassure — to confirm their ability to win and handle the presidency. For less serious or low-profile candidates, it’s an opportunity to break out — to cause party elites to reconsider or get voters to coalesce behind them."
"""In 30-plus years of politics, I’ve never seen this level of doom,"" said one prominent centrist Democrat.
Moderate Democrats watched in horror as Bernie Sanders soared to a landslide victory in Nevada.
It wasn't the win that was surprising — it was the walloping Sanders gave his opponents, his ability to dominate among Latino voters, and the momentum he gained moving into South Carolina and Super Tuesday. The performance sent already worried Democrats into a full-blown panic.
“In 30-plus years of politics, I’ve never seen this level of doom. I’ve..."
"On Wednesday, nearly four years after launching his first unlikely presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled a new version of one of his signature proposals: Medicare for All. The bill, which has 14 co-sponsors, outlines a universal, government-run healthcare program that would cover hospital care and preventative services, as well as dental and vision services. It would end employer-provided insurance plans, but the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Services would continue to exist as stand-alone, government-run systems, according to Vox. Americans could still choose their own physicians.
Overall,..."
"Nearly all Senate Democrats voted to block an anti-human trafficking bill on Tuesday over its abortion restrictions — prolonging an impasse that threatens to further delay a vote on Loretta Lynch as attorney general.
With the 55-43 tally, the Senate did not get the needed 60 votes to advance the trafficking bill to a vote for final passage. And it’s unclear what happens next to either that legislation or the Lynch nomination, as both sides on Tuesday showed no signs of relenting in the abortion fight.

"An amazing thing about Congress: Things can always get worse.
The Senate has now even found a way to disagree on a bill that would protect victims of sex trafficking. And in the process, that dispute has ensnared President Obama’s largely uncontroversial nominee for attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch.
On Tuesday, a measure that would create a victims’ fund, using fines collected from perpetrators of sex trafficking, failed to clear a procedural hurdle, leaving a bill that once had majority support in Congress in limbo.
The bill, sponsored by Senator..."
"President Joe Biden plans to establish a new ambassador-at-large position focused on the Arctic region, an area of growing geostrategic concern to the United States — as well as Russia and China.
The decision will be unveiled by the State Department on Friday, according to an announcement obtained in advance by POLITICO. The position will be subject to Senate confirmation.
It was not immediately clear who the nominee for the role will be, but a State Department official familiar with the issue predicted a name would be submitted soon.

"Nancy Pelosi beat back her toughest challenge yet to her leadership of Democrats in the House of Representatives, defeating Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan to secure another term as House minority leader.
The California Democrat got 134 votes to Ryan's 63 in a secret ballot vote on Wednesday. Pelosi had boasted going into the vote that she had support from two-thirds of the caucus, and she received just over that amount."
"A day after Brazil rejected aid from G-7 countries to fight wildfires in the Amazon, the Brazilian leader said he would consider accepting the $20 million of help, but only if French President Emmanuel Macron apologized to him personally for perceived insults first. Politics and feelings aside, forest fires have charred and continue to char the Amazon in Brazil. Just over half of the blazes have hit the massive Amazon basin, which regulates part of Earth's carbon cycle and climate."
"Brazil says it will reject an offer of at least $22 million from the rich countries in the Group of Seven to help fight fires sweeping through the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he doesn't want the money — unless it comes with an apology from French President Emmanuel Macron.
Bolsonaro and Macron have engaged in a dayslong spat after the French leader used the G-7 summit this week to call for action to protect the Amazon and said the fires are a world environmental crisis that Bolsonaro..."
"President Joe Biden predicted Wednesday that Russia will invade Ukraine, just as the United States launched a fresh effort to resolve the standoff and Moscow continued to mass troops on its neighbor's doorstep.
“My guess is he will move in, he has to do something,” said Biden during a news conference marking his first year in office, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine.
The declaration from Biden was striking given the escalating tensions there and the continued efforts by America and its allies to find a diplomatic solution."
"As National Football League owners and players’ union representatives meet in New York today and tomorrow to discuss the players’ recent demonstrations — the kneeling, linking arms or raising fists during the national anthem — they should know how the law views these protests. This will not only tell them what the league lawfully can do; it also will reveal something about American values."
"The president’s interventions in company dealings based on his own instincts are a departure from the arm’s-length approach of predecessors of either party.
President Trump campaigned on a promise to run the economy like his business empire. And for almost four years, he has unabashedly wielded the power of the presidency to insert himself into corporate affairs, helping some companies and punishing others in line with his instincts and inclinations.
The latest target of his attention is TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app under scrutiny for potentially providing the Chinese..."
"House Speaker Nancy on Wednesday morning named the lawmakers she has tapped to argue the House Democrats' case on the Senate floor when President Donald Trump's impeachment trial starts.
Pelosi, with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler at her side, began by saying ""an impeachment will last forever.""
Schiff and Nadler will be two of the mangers, Schiff designated by Pelosi as the lead manager.
""This is a very important day for us,"" she said.
""Time has been our friend in all this,"" she added,..."
"U.S. economic output has surpassed its pre-pandemic level after growing rapidly in the April-to-June quarter, the government announced Thursday.
The nation's gross economic product — the sum of all goods and services produced in the American economy — grew at a robust annualized rate of 6.5% in the second quarter of 2021, as vaccinations and government aid unleashed spending, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. 
The quarterly figure was less than analysts had expected, but the economy was likely held back mainly by supply shortages in goods, components and labor."
"With three days to go until the start of the Republican convention, President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney remain deadlocked in the race for the White House, according to a new national survey.
A CNN/ORC International poll released Friday also indicates Romney's favorable rating among those likely to vote in the presidential election is in the same ballpark as the president's, and the survey also points to a slightly higher level of enthusiasm for Republicans than Democrats."
"The Republican National Convention opens this week with President Obama and presumptive nominee Mitt Romney running evenly, with voters more focused on Obamas handling of the nations flagging economy than on some issues dominating the political debate in recent weeks.
A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows Romney at 47 percent among registered voters and Obama at 46 percent Ã¢â‚¬â€ barely changed from the deadlocked contest in early July."
"President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials.
Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity..."
"We now know that Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, spent the weeks after the 2020 election cheerleading the Trump White House’s efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in that election. One detail we do not yet know, however, is what Justice Thomas knew about his wife’s communications, and whether he tried to use his office to protect her.
In January, the Supreme Court permitted the US House committee investigating the January 6 attacks on the Capitol to obtain hundreds of pages of White House records that may..."
"President Joe Biden appeared on Saturday to urge the ouster of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a seemingly unscripted remark that differs with official US policy. His comments drew a quick White House walk back.
“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” the president said during a speech in Warsaw, Poland, that capped the president’s four-day trip to Europe.
The Biden administration has avoided advocating regime change in Russia. After Biden’s speech, the White House denied Biden had contradicted that stance. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to..."
"Trump is coming for your TikToks.
According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the administration is “looking at” the possibility of banning a range of Chinese apps, including the hugely popular video-sharing app.
TikTok, which was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of the year, has long been a source of national security concern for U.S. politicians, and now the Trump administration says it’s seriously considering banning the app."
"President Trump questioned the intensifying special counsel investigation of his 2016 campaign and his administration while attacking his own national security adviser, the FBI, Hillary Clinton, former president Barack Obama, Democrats in Congress, CNN and others in a remarkable nine-hour span of tweets that included profanity and misspellings."

"President Barack Obama heads to St. Paul, Minnesota on Wednesday to announce a new competition for grant funding meant to spur investment in infrastructure projects, according to information provided by the White House.
The President will call on cities and states to apply for $600 million in new TIGER discretionary grants, which were originally created as part of the 2009 Recovery Act and reauthorized in the Consolidated Appropriations Act signed earlier this year."
"President Joe Biden will meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday afternoon to discuss his roughly $2 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal, as he faces united Republican opposition to the plan and pressure from Democrats to move without GOP support.
The meeting will be the first time Biden sits down with lawmakers to discuss his proposal, which has been met with resistance by some lawmakers from both parties on Capitol Hill. The President unveiled his plan last month and it's aimed at improving the nation's infrastructure and shifting..."
"Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency on Friday and said he'll use all government resources to end a two-week protest by Canadian truckers over Covid-19 rules.
Ford said the trucker protest amounts to a ""siege"" of downtown Ottawa and the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Windsor and Detroit.
""It’s an illegal occupation,"" Ford told reporters. ""This is no longer a protest.""
Ford told protesters to go home and threatened heavy fines — but stopped just short of saying he’s ordering immediate police action to clear streets."
"The United States and five other world powers have reached a deal with Iran that would place strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear program in return for ending sanctions on its economy, the culmination of years of delicate diplomacy pursued by President Barack Obama despite warnings the agreement could strengthen Iran’s Islamist regime and leave it dangerously close to a nuclear bomb."
"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has again updated its guidance about how Covid-19 spreads to include information about potential for airborne transmission.
""CDC continues to believe, based on current science, that people are more likely to become infected the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19,"" the agency said in a statement on Monday.
""Today's update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after..."
"WASHINGTON — Relieved Republicans muscled their health care bill through the House Thursday, taking their biggest step toward dismantling the Obama health care overhaul since Donald Trump took office. They won passage only after overcoming their own divisions that nearly sank the measure six weeks ago."
"Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer charged on MSNBC's ""Up With Steve Kornacki"" show Saturday morning that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie held Hurricane Sandy relief funds hostage to force her to approve a development plan that overly favored one specific property holder.
""I cannot give a windfall to one property owner because the governor and other people want me to do it,"" Zimmer said on Kornacki's show. (You can watch the full interview here)."
"Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Sunday she didn't speak out earlier about her charges that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie withheld Superstorm Sandy recovery funds because she didn't think anyone would believe her.
Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union"" one day after she made the allegations on MSNBC, Zimmer said the the allegations are ""stunning"" and ""outrageous,"" but said they are true.
""I stand by my word,"" the Hoboken mayor said."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made an unannounced trip to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Saturday, becoming the most senior US official to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky since the war broke out more than two months ago.

"A shooter fired on an Independence Day parade from a rooftop in suburban Chicago, spraying the crowd with gunshots initially mistaken for fireworks before hundreds of panicked revelers of all ages fled in terror. At least six people were killed and at least 30 wounded.
An hourslong manhunt during which residents hunkered down in businesses or received police escorts to their homes ended with a traffic stop and brief chase Monday evening, when authorities detained a man they described as a person of interest. They gave no motive for the attack in..."
"A day of national celebration turned to tragedy Monday when a gunman killed six people and injured dozens more at a July Fourth parade in Highland Park, Illinois -- leaving the nation grieving yet another mass shooting.
The suspected shooter, identified by authorities as Robert E. Crimo III, used a ""high-powered rifle"" in an attack that appeared to be ""random"" and ""intentional,"" police said. They believe the shooter, who was apprehended later Monday, climbed onto a rooftop of a business and opened fire on the parade about 20 minutes after it started.
Some bystanders initially thought..."

"Stock futures rose Tuesday evening as lawmakers appeared to draw closer to an agreement for another round of virus-relief measures.
The three major indices ended the regular session higher after falling earlier in the day. The Dow and S&P 500 each reversed losses from Monday, and the Nasdaq jumped to yet another record closing high.
More upbeat developments on a stimulus package helped alleviate concerns over economic fallout that might emerge as COVID-19 cases surge and trigger more lockdowns. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Twitter that..."

The next Congress will include the largest number of women ever among its membership Ã¢â‚¬â€ 20 in the Senate, an increase of two, and at least 77 in the House, up by four, with two others vying in races that had not been called late Wednesday."
"I almost always get asked the same question: How can it possibly be the ""end of men"" when there are so few female elected officials -- when men still hold the reins of political power?
It's an excellent question. Until now, I've answered by pointing to statistical trends and future projections. Always, I ask people to take a leap of faith. But after this election, I feel like I am on so much more solid ground.

"Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is 96% effective in teenagers 12- to 17-years-old, the drugmaker said Thursday. The company announced results of the Phase 2 trial in reporting first-quarter earnings. Its vaccine generated $1.7 billion in revenue in its fiscal first quarter.
Evidence that Moderna's vaccine is effective in teens comes as rival Pfizer is expected to receive federal authorization by early next week to use its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents. Federal approval of one or more vaccines against the disease could enable many American middle and high school students to be..."
"Contrary to click-bait headlines this week, the State Department inspector general’s report proves that Hillary Clinton is by a long shot the most qualified and trustworthy candidate running for president. But don’t take my word for it, take five minutes and read the report yourself. The section about Clinton “breaking the rules” is less than six pages long."
"President Joe Biden during a new interview with Israel's Channel 12 said that the US would be willing to take military action against Iran as a ""last resort"" to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons. 
Israeli news anchor Yonit Levi noted that Biden in the past said he would ""do anything"" to ensure Iran doesn't acquire nuclear weapons. Levi asked if that also meant the president would ""use force"" against Iran.

"Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, Donald Trump’s fiercest Republican adversary in Congress, soundly lost a GOP primary, falling to a rival backed by the former president in a rout that reinforced his grip on the party’s base.
The third-term congresswoman and her allies entered Tuesday downbeat about her prospects, aware that Trump’s backing gave Harriet Hageman considerable lift in the state where he won by the largest margin during the 2020 campaign. Cheney was already looking ahead to a political future beyond Capitol Hill that could include a 2024 presidential run, potentially putting..."
"The White House indicated Friday that it does not intend to mount a defense in the ongoing impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump. White House counsel Pat Cipollone made the announcement in a letter to House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) Friday, in which he called the proceedings “completely baseless.”
The letter clarifies some uncertainty created by a previous missive Cipollone sent to the Judiciary Committee in which he refused to make clear whether Trump would participate in upcoming hearings."
"President Trump has decided to stay out of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone rejected an offer from House Democrats that would have allowed the president to send counsel to represent him at future impeachment hearings.
In a short two-paragraph letter to Democrats, Cipollone said the impeachment inquiry is ""completely baseless and has violated basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness."""
"World leaders turned up the heat and resorted to end-of-the-world rhetoric Monday in an attempt to bring new urgency to sputtering international climate negotiations.
The metaphors were dramatic and mixed at the start of the talks, known as COP26. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson described global warming as “a doomsday device” strapped to humanity. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres told his colleagues that humans are “digging our own graves.” And Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, added moral thunder, warning leaders not to “allow the path of greed..."

“We have to win the election. And I would point out that I ran the most successful campaign to engage the communities we need to build the broadest coalition necessary in 2020, because what we are going to see on the ground is that this is going to be a campaign unlike anything that’s been run before,” Abrams told me.

"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Wednesday unveiled new campus sexual assault rules that bolster the rights of accused rapists and reduce legal liabilities for colleges.
The dramatic shift — including giving accused sex attackers the right to cross-examine their alleged victims — rolls back zero tolerance policies that DeVos claims led to some students being railroaded.
“We can continue to combat sexual misconduct without abandoning our core values of fairness, presumption of innocence and due process,” she said.
Under the new rules, students on both sides must be given equal..."

Ten more will be out there Wednesday, with the frontrunners trying to hold their places, while those trailing in the polls will do what they can to make a lasting impression and boost their campaigns.
The first night in Detroit largely pitted Democratic moderates like former Rep. John Delaney and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock against progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth..."
"In places, the Loire can now be crossed on foot; France’s longest river has never flowed so slowly. The Rhine is fast becoming impassable to barge traffic. In Italy, the Po is 2 metres lower than normal, crippling crops. Serbia is dredging the Danube.
Across Europe, drought is reducing once-mighty rivers to trickles, with potentially dramatic consequences for industry, freight, energy and food production – just as supply shortages and price rises due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine bite.
Driven by climate breakdown, an unusually dry winter and spring followed by record-breaking summer..."
"President Trump and his allies on Sunday declared victory in the tariffs standoff with Mexico after the administration appeared to have secured significant commitments from the Mexican government to stem the flow of Central American migrants at the U.S. border.
The agreement gave Trump fresh ammunition against his critics, who have pointed out that his controversial negotiating tactics have yielded far fewer results than promised on multiple issues during his time in office.
Whether the deal will greatly reduce the number of migrants entering the United States remains to be..."
"The Russian Navy is conducting what Russian officials call its largest exercise in the Pacific Ocean since the end of the Cold War. The exercise, about 300-500 miles west of Hawaii, comes just ahead of the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, their first since Mr. Biden took office in January. 
The exercise includes surface ships, anti-submarine aircraft and long range bombers. 
U.S. defense officials said that on Sunday, the U.S. scrambled F-22s from Hawaii in response to the bomber flights, but the bombers did not..."
"Nine members of a Mormon community of dual U.S.-Mexican citizens were killed in northern Mexico Monday in what appears to be a vicious drug cartel attack. Mexico’s minister for public security confirmed Tuesday that three women and six children were killed in broad daylight as they drove on a highway in the border state of Sonora, an area contested by organized crime groups. One vehicle reportedly stopped because of a flat tire, and assailants attacked the stranded car, killing the driver and four children, including 6-month-old twins. The attackers then..."
"Rudy wouldn't be Rudy if he backed down.
But by amplifying his charge that President Barack Obama doesn't love America, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appears ready to risk sullying the powerful mythology that grew around his leadership when he steadied and steeled the nation in the terrible, confusing time after 9/11.
Since those fleeting days when he was a unifying figure, Giuliani has more often dealt in waspish rhetoric and savage mockery -- especially of a president he says has ""failed.""
""America's Mayor"" has gone rogue, lashing out..."
"For those who first dialed into Rudolph W. Giuliani during his “America’s mayor” phase, right after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — when he wowed the world with his civic leadership, soaring oratory and unifying largess — the former New York mayor’s racially charged comments about President Obama might seem puzzling.
But Mr. Giuliani’s road to and through City Hall was punctuated with racial controversy.
From his 1993 campaign challenging David N. Dinkins, the city’s first African-American mayor, during which Mr. Giuliani stood with rowdy protesting police officers —..."
"The attorney general of New York state has filed a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children involved in the family real-estate business, for falsely inflating his net worth by billions in order to enrich himself and secure favorable loans.
Announcing the suit in New York on Wednesday, Letitia James also said referrals had been made to federal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service – a move sure to anger the former US president and increase consternation among his inner circle about the depth of his..."
"When all is said and done in the 2016 election, historians may well look back at South Carolina as a make-or-break moment for Jeb Bush, a once jaunty technocrat laid low by reality-television star Donald Trump and betrayed by his android protégé Marco Rubio. As Saturday’s primary looms, insiders say his hopes of staying in the race will hinge on him coming in no less than third"
"In just under four months, more than 100,000 Americans are now reported to have died from the novel coronavirus, a grim milestone President Donald Trump once suggested the country would never see.
Roughly a month ago, Trump, at a White House task force briefing, said, ""It looks like we'll be at about a 60,000 mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of.""
A few days later, on April 24, he again sought to highlight a lesser number: ""Minimal numbers were going to be 100,000 people. And we're..."
"The Biden administration has canceled one of the most high-profile oil and gas lease opportunities pending before the Interior Department. The decision, which halts the potential to drill for oil in over 1 million acres in the Cook Inlet in Alaska, comes at a challenging political moment, when gas prices are hitting painful new highs.
In a statement shared first with CBS News, the Department of the Interior cited a ""lack of industry interest in leasing in the area"" for the decision to ""not move forward"" with the Cook Inlet..."
"House Republicans defied President Donald Trump’s wishes on Christmas Eve, blocking the passage of a proposal to include $2,000 stimulus checks — something the president demanded in an angry video posted to Twitter on Tuesday night while threatening to upend months of negotiations over government funding and coronavirus relief.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dared Republicans to object to Trump’s call for bigger direct payments, something Democrats have been arguing in favor of for months, by putting up a clean bill for $2,000 stimulus checks on the House floor, while..."
"Legendary multi-billionaire businessman Eli Broad wrote a heartfelt New York Times opinion column this month urging a broad wealth tax to improve income inequality. Worthy goal. The column's subhead says, “Wealthy people like me should commit to reducing the ravages of economic inequality.” Most wealth lists say I’m only worth about half what Broad is, but I have an idea for him that is twice as good, faster and more direct than any wealth tax.
We all want people to do better — or should. Helping is surely good; but..."
"There’s a story we like to tell about American capitalism. Ours is a country that prizes merit, rewards risk and stands apart in its commitment to the collective success of open markets and the free flow of capital. We are a nation of strivers who can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps with the right combination of grit and determination.
That’s the tale we love to tell and hear. But take it from a person who has found himself on the fortunate side of that narrative: This story is incomplete...."
"Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election turns a year old on Thursday. In 365 days, Mueller's team has charged 19 people, as well as three companies, and secured five guilty pleas. He is showing no signs of slowing down."
"Politico faced an internal uproar on Thursday after its decision to let right-wing podcast host Ben Shapiro write a guest column in its widely read Politico Playbook newsletter, with staff asking editors why a pundit with “a long history of bigoted and incendiary commentary” would be given such a massive platform.
Shapiro, who rose to prominence as an editor at far-right media outlet Breitbart before founding right-wing aggregation site The Daily Wire and becoming a YouTube and talk radio personality, routinely courts online outrage through bigoted rhetoric. After supporters..."
"Covid-19 hospitalizations among children in the US are soaring, fueled by the Omicron variant and the holidays, and adding pressure to already-strained health systems and schools.
An average of 672 children were being hospitalized every day in the US, as of 2 January - more than double the average just a week before. And the rate is rapidly increasing.
Cases are also rising. There were more than 325,000 new cases among kids in the week ending 23 December, a 64% increase from the previous week and nearly double the cases two weeks earlier, the..."
"Hospitals across the U.S. are feeling the wrath of the omicron variant and getting thrown into disarray that is different from earlier COVID-19 surges.
This time, they are dealing with serious staff shortages because so many health care workers are getting sick with the fast-spreading variant. People are showing up at emergency rooms in large numbers in hopes of getting tested for COVID-19, putting more strain on the system. And a surprising share of patients — two-thirds in some places — are testing positive while in the hospital for other reasons.
At the same..."
"Most Supreme Court appointments are in a way inconsequential. A conservative replaces a conservative, a liberal replaces a liberal, and the court’s basic direction is unchanged. That is not the case with the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, whose Senate confirmation hearings will begin on Tuesday. Judge Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative than the justice he would replace, Anthony M. Kennedy."
"US Secret Service investigators have seized $286 million in illegally obtained coronavirus pandemic relief funds, the agency announced Friday.
An investigation run by the service's Orlando, Florida, field office determined conspirators fraudulently submitted small business pandemic relief loan applications ""using fabricated or stolen employment and personal information,"" the agency said. The US Secret Service said criminals used a third-party payment system and over 15,000 accounts to conceal and move illegal funds.
The US Secret Service has ramped up efforts to target criminals who unlawfully obtained pandemic relief funds two years..."
"President Joe Biden’s first budget calls for massive boosts to low-income schools, public health programs and fighting climate change, plus a slight Pentagon funding bump that is unlikely to fly with many in Congress.
The request unveiled by the White House on Friday asks Congress to provide non-defense programs with a total of $769 billion for the upcoming fiscal year, in addition to $753 billion for national defense programs, including cash for overseas activities.
That amounts to a 16 percent increase over current funding levels for domestic programs — bringing..."
"The U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday expressed concerns that a controversial audit and recount of the November election in Arizona's Maricopa County may be out of compliance with federal laws.
Pamela Karlan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, wrote in a letter that federal officials see two issues with the election review ordered by the Republican-led state Senate.
One issue is that ballots, voting systems and other election materials are no longer in the custody of election officials — a possible violation..."
"Untrained citizens are trying to find traces of bamboo on last year’s ballots, seemingly trying to prove a conspiracy theory that the election was tainted by fake votes from Asia. Thousands of ballots are left unattended and unsecured. People with open partisan bias, including a man who was photographed on the Capitol steps during the Jan. 6 riot, are doing the recounting.
All of these issues with the Republican-backed re-examination of the November election results from Arizona’s most populous county were laid out this week by Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s Democratic..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats who reviewed a secret whistleblower complaint involving President Donald Trump Wednesday called it “deeply disturbing” and said it gives them new leads to pursue as they consider impeachment.
The complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower, the document at the center of a firestorm about Trump’s handling of Ukraine, was made available to members of House and Senate intelligence committees Wednesday after weeks of delay. Lawmakers were allowed to see the complaint the evening before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was set to testify to..."
"The House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released the declassified whistleblower complaint at the center of a standoff between the White House and Congress that led to a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.
The complaint, which the administration initially withheld from Congress, was declassified with minimal redactions, and relates to Trump's July phone call with the president of Ukraine in which he asked his foreign counterpart to look into why that country's top prosecutor apparently had ended an investigation of the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son.

"A new pair of nationwide polls paint divergent pictures of the 2020 White House race — with former Vice President Joe Biden ahead by double digits in one survey and President Donald Trump significantly narrowing the presumptive Democratic nominee’s lead in the other.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday morning reports that more than half of registered voters, 53 percent, prefer Biden, while 41 percent favor Trump.
That 12-point advantage, however, comes hours after a CNN poll published Sunday evening showed Biden’s lead tightening to only 4 points, as..."
"What unfolded on the battlefield of Kharkiv oblast in recent days was a remarkable turning point in Ukraine’s desperate battle to resist Russia’s invasion. A more agile force chased a lumbering army into retreat. The war is not over by any means, but the counteroffensive in Kharkiv has exposed anew Russian President Vladimir Putin’s catastrophic miscalculations that Ukraine would collapse, that it would surrender, that it would be steamrolled by Russia’s massive armor. Not so.
Russia apparently figured the next battle would be for Kherson, to the south, and redeployed forces in..."
"President Joe Biden on Saturday hailed Congress’ passage of his $1 trillion infrastructure package as a “monumental step forward for the nation” after fractious fellow Democrats resolved a months-long standoff in their ranks to seal the deal.
“Finally, infrastructure week,” a beaming Biden told reporters. “I’m so happy to say that: infrastructure week.”
The House passed the measure 228-206 late Friday, prompting prolonged cheers from the relieved Democratic side of the chamber. Thirteen Republicans, mostly moderates, supported the legislation while six of Democrats’ farthest left members opposed it.

"They met just once. But Barack Obama looked to Nelson Mandela for inspiration for more than three decades, from a California campus to inner-city Chicago to the White House.
Mandela’s influence stirred Obama to get involved in the fight against apartheid at Occidental College and guided the future president from community organizing to politics, as he sought to affect tangible, lasting change."
"President Barack Obama spoke Thursday on the death of Nelson Mandela, praising the South African leader for having ""achieved more than could be expected of any man.""
""We've lost one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with,"" Obama said. ""He no longer belongs to us, he belongs to the ages ... His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to.""
""I am one of the countless millions..."
"The only way we’re going to stop these endless cycles of police violence is by creating alternatives to policing. Because even in a pandemic where black people have been disproportionately killed by the coronavirus, the police are still murdering us.
On Monday, a worker at a store in Minneapolis called 911, claiming that George Floyd had used counterfeit money. The incident ended with a police officer suffocating Mr. Floyd to death, despite his and bystanders’ pleas for mercy. Protests have since erupted across the country while the police respond with..."
"Today is Earth Day, which should provide us with an opportunity to pause and confront the awful predicament humanity faces. We eat microplastics, breathe pollution and watch other life-forms decline to extinction. We face intersecting poverty, health, climate and biodiversity crises. Our global predicament is that consumption by the wealthy is driving us towards planetary disaster, yet billions live in poverty and need to consume more to live well. In this cycle, any version of “success” only hastens catastrophe.
Solving this conundrum requires much more than merely reducing the impact..."
"WASHINGTON — Even by the standards of President Trump’s administration, Rep. John Ratcliffe’s troubled nomination to run America’s intelligence services died quickly.
Trump announced Ratcliffe’s withdrawal by presidential tweet on Friday, less than a week after the Texas congressman was put forward to become the new Director of National Intelligence. From the jump, Ratcliffe was dogged by accusations that he'd padded his resume with boasts of terrorist prosecutions that never happened."
"Hundreds of journalists from the Wall Street Journal signed a letter this week criticizing the paper’s opinion section for spreading misinformation.
The stunning rebuke, signed by 280 staffers of the Journal and sent to the paper’s new publisher, calls for better fact-checking, more transparency, and a clearer divide between news and opinion divisions, according to a draft of the letter obtained by Mediaite.
“Opinion’s lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence, undermine our readers’ trust and our ability to gain credibility with sources,” the letter to..."
"To hear President Trump tell it in his State of the Union speech Tuesday, he rescued a declining, hollowed-out economy from ruin to create the greatest era of prosperity in U.S. history.
Trump has presided over a solid economy since taking office in 2017 but mischaracterized the state of the economy under President Obama and overstated his accomplishments. In truth, the economy has mounted a steady recovery since the Great Recession of 2007-09, marking the longest expansion in American history.
“You have seen a continuation of the trend,” says Elise..."
"President Trump’s State of the Union speech once again was chock-full of stretched facts and dubious figures. Many of these claims have been fact-checked repeatedly, yet the president persists in using them. Here, in the order in which he made them, are 31 statements by the president.

"Facebook has confronted whistleblowers, PR firestorms and Congressional inquiries in recent years. But now it faces a combination of all three at once in what could be the most intense and wide-ranging crisis in the company's 17-year history.
On Friday, a consortium of 17 US news organizations began publishing a series of stories — collectively called ""The Facebook Papers"" — based on a trove of hundreds of internal company documents which were included in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel.

The Arizona Republican made the announcement to run for a sixth term on Monday in an interview with NBC News (

McCain uses his position as chairman to criticize President Barack Obama on national security.

"In a rare, private meeting with nearly all 100 senators Monday night, the upper chamber failed to come up with a deal to avert the so-called nuclear option—a partisan threat by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that would eliminate filibusters for executive-branch nominees.
But after the nearly four-hour meeting, senators said Reid and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell are expected to keep talking before a Tuesday deadline."
"Senate Democrats are close to having the 60 votes needed to advance the long-stalled nomination of Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to Senate sources, potentially giving senators more time to reach a deal to avert the “nuclear option.”
The Senate still faces a potentially historic vote later Tuesday on changing its filibuster rules on other executive-branch nominations, but high-level talks are ongoing."
"President Donald Trump on Monday night backed away from his push for a vote on an Obamacare replacent until after the 2020 elections, bowing to the political reality that major health care legislation cannot pass in the current Congress.
Trump's statements come a week after his administration announced that it now agreed with a judge's ruling that the entire Affordable Care Act should be scrapped. The opinion was a dramatic reversal from the administration's previous stance that only portions of the act could not be defended.
Trump's latest move allows..."
"The July 4 recess is a time when members of Congress head back home to put on their ""casual"" clothes (khakis, patterned Oxford shirt) and hang with the regular folks, munching on hot dogs and walking in a few Independence Day parades. It's a chance to convene with the constituents, listen to their thoughts about the issues and challenges our nation faces, then head back to Washington revived and recommitted to this great experiment in self-rule."
"The coronavirus pandemic last year left millions of people out of work and set off the worst economic contraction since the Great Depression. Yet the share of people living in poverty in the United States fell to a record low because of the government’s enormous relief effort.
About 9.1 percent of Americans were poor last year, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday, down from 11.8 percent in 2019. That figure — the lowest since records began in 1967, according to calculations from researchers at Columbia University — is based on a measure that accounts..."

Mr. Musk agreed in April to buy Twitter but declared last week that he intended to walk away from the deal. To push Mr. Musk to abide by the acquisition agreement, Twitter sued him in Chancery Court in Delaware. The court will determine whether he remains on the hook for the purchase or whether Twitter violated its obligation..."
"A 41-day occupation at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon ended Thursday when the four remaining protesters surrendered to authorities, according to a live-streamed phone call transmitted from the scene.
For a moment, the surrender took a dramatic turn when the last holdout refused to follow the other three and continued the standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge's headquarters in Harney County."
"There is one thing to be said about Attorney General Eric Holder. He has a way with words that makes conservatives furious - especially when he starts talking about race and the law.
There are many examples. Early in the Obama administration, Holder said that we are ""a nation of cowards"" when it comes to issues of race."
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced on Thursday that the Justice Department would ask a court to require Texas to get permission from the federal government before making voting changes in that state for the next decade. The move opens a new chapter in the political struggle over election rules after the Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act last month.

"Mitt Romneys campaign swiftly responded to the Tax Policy Centers damning analysis of his tax plan by arguing that it was woefully incomplete. By only analyzing his reforms for individual tax rates, it said, the study didnt take into account the corporate tax reform that Romney is proposing or the economic boost that would accompany those changes. “These glaring gaps invalidate the reports conclusions, Lanhee Chen, Romneys policy director, said in a statement."
"The study was developed by the centrist Tax Policy Center and authored by economists who have worked under both the Obama and Bush administrations.
It concluded that Romneys proposed tax cuts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which include reducing all personal income taxes rates by 20 percent, eliminating the estate tax and zeroing-out taxes on investment income for couples earning less than $200,000 per year Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would slash $360 billion in federal revenues in 2015."
"Twitter has added a warning to one of President Donald Trump’s tweets about protests in Minneapolis, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.”
Trump, a prolific Twitter user, has been at war with the company since earlier this week, when it for the first time applied fact checks to two of his tweets. Those were about mail-in ballots.
The third tweet to be flagged came amid days of violent protests over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police..."

Demonstrators are demanding action over the death of the 46-year-old unarmed black man after shocking video footage showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck.

For years, the California senator was known as “the female Obama.” Six months ago, she had rocketed into the top tier of the primary field.

"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A retired police captain who died during a night of violent protests was trying to protect his friend’s pawn shop, his widow said.
David Dorn’s last moments were caught on video and apparently posted on Facebook Live, though the video has since been taken down. He was killed by people who had broken into Lee’s Pawn & Jewelry, and his body found on the sidewalk at about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday. No arrests have been made.
His death came on a violent night in St. Louis, where..."
"Ted Cruz took a page out of his pastor father's Bible on Friday night in Iowa.
At his ""Rally for Religious Liberty,"" Cruz sought to appeal to evangelical Republican voters and frame himself as a fighter for religious rights.
A crowd of over 2,500 men, women and young children turned out for the three-plus hour event. Upon arrival at the venue, guests received Ted Cruz Pocket Constitutions, Cruz stickers, mini-American flags emblazoned with ""Courageous Conservatives for Cruz,"" bracelets reading ""Marriage = 1 man + 1 woman,"" and, for younger attendees,..."
"Senator Ted Cruz on Friday night drew one of the largest crowds in Iowa of any candidate this year: some 2,300 Christian conservatives, who turned out for an unusual program featuring people Mr. Cruz called “victims of government persecution.”
The eight people included bakers, a florist, wedding planners and others from several states. All of them said they had been sued, fined or fired for refusing service to same-sex couples or for expressing opposition to homosexuality. Several of them were well known to audiences of right-leaning news media.

"As businesses reopened Friday in more of the U.S., an overwhelming majority of states still fall short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks, according to an Associated Press analysis.
Rapid, widespread testing is considered essential to tracking and containing the coronavirus. But 41 of the nation’s 50 states fail to test widely enough to drive their infections below a key benchmark, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by Harvard’s Global Health..."
"After an April that some experts described as “wasted,” it looks like America is finally making some real progress on coronavirus testing in May.
Over the past couple of weeks, the United States has seen significant improvements not just with the raw number of Covid-19 tests but also with other metrics experts use to gauge the scope of the US’s coronavirus outbreak and its testing capacity.
During the week of May 5, the US averaged nearly 300,000 new coronavirus tests a day, according to the Covid Tracking Project. That’s nearly..."
"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the Supreme Court late Monday night to take up a lawsuit against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, arguing that the battleground states exploited the Covid-19 pandemic to justify ignoring federal and state election laws. He seeks to block election results from the states.
It is the latest long shot petition to reach the high court challenging election results and faces tough odds before the justices.
If a state seeks to sue another state it can go directly to the Supreme Court but it..."
"One day after Senate Democrats dealt a blow to President Barack Obama’s trade agenda in the upper chamber, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said he is “still optimistic” Congress has the votes to give the president authority to fast-track international trade deals.
Boehner said that no matter what, the House will figure out how to deal with the trade legislation once it hits the floor.
On Tuesday, Senate Democrats united to defeat the so-called trade promotion authority bill, which would give the president expedited power to funnel trade deals through..."
"Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, positioning himself to lead a nation gripped by the historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil.
His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed the processing of some ballots. Biden crossed 270 Electoral College votes with a win in Pennsylvania.
Biden, 77, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a..."
"Biden defeats Trump in presidential election
Joe Biden, the former vice president and longtime fixture of national politics, is projected to win the state of Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press.
That means Biden will have the required 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.
Biden would also have won a bitterly fought contest for president after vowing to usher in a robust response to the once-in-a-century pandemic and a renewed focus on civility that has been largely absent during four years of chaos and division..."
"The cost of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is expected to rise an average of 22 percent in 2017, according to information released by the Obama administration Monday afternoon.
Still, federal subsidies will also rise, meaning that few people are likely to have to pay the full cost after the rate increases to get insurance coverage."
"Testimony from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday was enlightening in several respects. The two defense officials may not have persuaded those who wanted to continue an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, but they certainly put President Biden’s decision-making in context.
Much of the media’s attention focused on Milley, who at the beginning of the hearing shattered the notion that he had acted outside the chain of command or usurped civilian control in the waning days of..."
"The Federal Reserve pushed up the odds that the country will fall into a recession on Wednesday when it tightened up the flow of money in the most aggressive move in 22 years.
Led by Jerome Powell, the central bank has essentially put the economy in reverse and jammed on the accelerator in a bid to speed away from inflation, stoked by $5 trillion in stimulus, more than two years of practically free credit, and a global trade system jammed up by the lingering effects of the pandemic. Inflation is..."
"A human-rights catastrophe has taken shape on the border in Texas -- and it has happened on the Biden administration's watch. Monday, the nation saw horrifying images of Border Patrol officials appearing to chase and confront asylum seekers, who were largely Haitian, near the international bridge between Coahuila, Mexico, and Del Rio, Texas.
The video appears to show abusive treatment by agents on horseback trying to corral terrified migrants. As CNN reported: ""In one video by Al Jazeera English that circulated widely on social media, an agent yells, 'This is why your..."
"The Pentagon is mandating that US military service members get fully vaccinated against Covid-19 immediately, after the Food and Drug Administration fully approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine this week.
""After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people,"" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin wrote in a memo released Wednesday.
He added, ""To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force.""

"The global standoff between the United States and Iran over shipping escalated Saturday after the United States issued a warrant for the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker detained in Gibraltar, just hours after the ship was ordered released.
The Grace 1 supertanker was intercepted in waters off Gibraltar by the British navy last month on suspicion that it was delivering oil to Syria in violation of E.U. sanctions. The move triggered the capture by Iran two weeks later of a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf in..."
"The U.S. Justice Department issued a warrant to seize an Iranian oil tanker detained in Gibraltar, a day after a judge in the British overseas territory ordered its release.
The U.S. move late Friday deepens a weeks-long diplomatic dispute between Tehran and Washington. It also comes amid a standoff between the two countries after President Donald Trump withdrew from an international nuclear accord with Tehran and reimposed sanctions. Tensions in the Persian Gulf have been on the rise since."
"Saying he apologizes for ""any embarrassment I have caused for my colleagues and constituents,"" Kansas Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder has confirmed a Politico report that he was the ""nude member of Congress"" who took a dip in the Sea of Galilee last year during a late-night escapade ""that involved drinking [and] numerous GOP freshmen lawmakers.""
According to Politico:"
"The FBI probed a late-night swim in the Sea of Galilee that involved drinking, numerous GOP freshmen lawmakers, top leadership staff Ã¢â‚¬â€ and one nude member of Congress, according to more than a dozen sources, including eyewitnesses.
During a fact-finding congressional trip to the Holy Land last summer, Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) took off his clothes and jumped into the sea, joining a number of members, their families and GOP staff during a night out in Israel, the sources told POLITICO. Other participants, including the daughter of another congressman,..."
"President Donald Trump’s campaign filed lawsuits Wednesday in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, laying the groundwork for contesting battleground states as he slipped behind Democrat Joe Biden in the hunt for the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.
The new filings, joining existing Republican legal challenges in Pennsylvania and Nevada, demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and raise absentee ballot concerns, the campaign said. However, at one Michigan location in question The Associated Press observed poll watchers from..."
"After a redistricting proposal made Texas’ 34th Congressional District more blue last fall, the top Republican candidate for the seat, Mayra Flores, traveled to the state Capitol in Austin to plead with lawmakers to reconsider.
It seemed, she said, that despite all the new Republican talk about competing in South Texas, the GOP map-drawers were “sending the message of not really caring about” voters there, depriving them of a competitive district.
But lawmakers were unswayed and eventually passed a map that transformed the 34th District from one that President Joe..."
"Pharmaceutical companies Merck & Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced Monday the submission of emergency use authorization to the Food and Drug Administration for molnupiravir, an antiviral drug that offers the promise that COVID-19 could soon be treated by a pill.
Molnupiravir, an orally ingested antiviral pill, is used to treat mild to moderate adult cases of COVID-19 that are at risk of worsening to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization, according to the companies. It was created by researchers at Emory University in Atlanta and is given as four pills taken twice a day for five days.
An interim analysis from a clinical trial found the..."
"Two weeks before Independence Day, the United States had a legitimate reason to celebrate. After more than a year of worry and restrictions that followed the emergence of the coronavirus, the number of new cases each day had fallen to a little over 11,000, the lowest level since the virus first emerged in March 2020. The rapid vaccination of millions of Americans had cut off potential hosts. Combined with warmer weather that pushed people outside, the virus was far less able to gain ground.
Over the past two weeks, though, the..."
"The COVID-19 curve in the U.S. is rising again after months of decline, with the number of new cases per day doubling over the past three weeks, driven by the fast-spreading delta variant, lagging vaccination rates and Fourth of July gatherings.
Confirmed infections climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day on Monday, up from 11,300 on June 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. And all but two states — Maine and South Dakota — reported that case numbers have gone up over the past two weeks.

"Democrats are blocking an attempt to give small businesses a $250 billion boost. But why?
At first glance, it’s a surprising move, since Democrats support providing more funding to small businesses and workers experiencing severe economic trouble caused by the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. But the answer is simple: Democrats want to use the leverage they have in Congress so that Republicans don’t just approve more money for small businesses while leaving out other programs that also desperately need more funding.
This approach was evident Thursday when Senate Democrats..."
"SAN FRANCISCO — Billionaire activist Tom Steyer says he will use “the exact same methods” in his fledgling Democratic presidential campaign that he’s used for more than a decade in California, where he has registered hundreds of thousands of voters and thrown millions into passing several major ballot measures.
“We’re a get-out-to-the-people, directly-address-the-people organization,’’ Steyer told POLITICO Tuesday. “I’ve been an outsider this whole time in Democratic politics."""
"Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee voted unilaterally Thursday to advance Amy Coney Barrett’s supreme court nomination to the full Senate despite Democrats’ refusal to sit in the hearing room for what they called a naked “power grab”.
Democratic senators had announced the night before that they would not participate in any move to install Donald Trump’s third supreme court nominee even as tens of millions of Americans vote in a presidential election less than two weeks away.
No supreme court nominee has ever been installed so close to a..."
"Donbas, a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region that blankets much of eastern Ukraine, has been the front line of the country's conflict with Russia since 2014.
But now its people, already scarred by eight years of fighting, are bracing for an assault even more intense. An impending battle for control of the territory is expected to define Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, after his forces suffered costly failures in Kyiv, and across central and northern Ukraine.
Satellite images have shown Russian military convoys and resupplied units moving towards Donbas for a large-scale offensive,..."
"A career official in the White House security office says dozens of people in President Donald Trump’s administration were granted security clearances despite “disqualifying issues” in their backgrounds, such as concerns about foreign influence, drug use and criminal conduct.
Tricia Newbold, an 18-year government employee who oversees the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides, says she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year because of their backgrounds. But she says senior Trump aides overturned those decisions, moves that..."
"Jared Kushner can probably thank nepotism for winning a security clearance that even President Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly opposed, but he’s hardly the only one whose approval set off alarm bells, according to House Democrats.
In fact, the White House issued security clearances to 25 people who’d initially been denied for having glaring red flags all over their applications, a whistleblower working inside the White House has told Congress."
"WASHINGTON — The governor's race is too close to call in Kentucky, NBC News projects, one of three states with off-year elections Tuesday that will test both President Donald Trump's ability to motivate Republican voters in the midst of the impeachment inquiry and Democrats' chances of capitalizing on his unpopularity ahead of next year's presidential election.
Trump injected himself into two governors' races in the South, holding a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi, for Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves last Friday and then traveling to Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday to boost Gov...."
"Polls closed Tuesday in four states where off-year governor’s races and legislative elections offer a test of voter enthusiasm and party organization amid impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump and a fevered Democratic presidential primary scramble.
Results in Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia won’t necessarily predict whether Trump will be reelected or which party will control Congress after the general election next fall. But partisans of all stripes invariably will scrutinize the results of these odd-year elections for clues about how voters are reacting to the impeachment saga and..."
"WNBA star Brittney Griner has been sentenced to 9 years in a Russian prison, on charges of smuggling drugs into the country.
Griner's lawyers said, in a statement shared with PEOPLE, that the verdict, just below the maximum sentence of 10 years, is ""absolutely unreasonable"" and said they will ""certainly file an appeal.""
A Russian judge read Griner, 31, her verdict Thursday about an hour after her lawyers and the prosecution presented their closing arguments. The Phoenix Mercury star had given an emotional speech, reiterating her stance that though she pled guilty to..."
"The Senate majority is firmly within Democrats' reach with just a week to go until Election Day.
That wasn't necessarily expected a year ago, but Democrats' improving fortunes have a lot do with President Donald Trump. Republicans breathed a sigh of relief after the second presidential debate last week, where they think the President at least didn't hurt himself. But Trump has been a consistent drag on down-ballot Republicans, and he's spurred Democrats to raise staggering sums of money."
"Democrats are seeking to make Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearing about the Affordable Care Act, but in her first day answering questions, she had a pretty simple answer.
While she has criticized Chief Justice John Roberts’ 5-4 ruling in the original Obamacare case in 2012, the case coming before the high court next month involves a completely different issue, she said.
In 2012, the court was asked to decide if the entire law was unconstitutional. This time, it’s about whether a tax penalty that Congress eliminated in..."
"Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett presented herself to the nation Monday as a humble and apolitical judge, opening a pandemic-altered Senate confirmation hearing that Democrats tried to make as much about health care, covid-19 and President Trump as about Barrett’s qualifications.
It was the start of what will be an acrimonious four days, as Republicans embark just weeks before Election Day on a historic move to lock in a long-sought 6-to-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court and perhaps boost Trump’s and their own reelection prospects.
Democrats acknowledged there..."
"As tens of millions of people worldwide have taken to the streets over the past six weeks to pronounce that Black lives matter, corporate America has been nudged into action. But instead of marching alongside protesters, it’s eyeing its own shelves.
Quaker Oats spoke up first, announcing in June that Aunt Jemima, the name and face of the brand’s syrup and pancake mix for more than 130 years, would be no more. The company said in a statement that “while work has been done over the years to update the..."
"An interfaith coalition is pressing the world’s largest brewer to remove the name of a Hindu god from a popular beer that dates to the late 1800s — a dispute the beermaker insists is a case of mistaken identity.
The group, which includes representatives of the Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu and Jain religions, is calling on Belgium-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV to rename its Brahma line, a favorite in Brazil.
Brahma was first produced in 1888 by Companhia Cervejaria Brahma, a Brazilian brewery now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose..."
"A legal barrier of sorts has been broken: The FBI obtained and executed a search warrant on the home of a former president of the United States. This represents the kind of maiden legal voyage by the Department of Justice that has been prompted by the conduct of Donald J. Trump.
There are few things we know — and much we don’t know — about Monday’s search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home. Let’s start with what we do know.
First, the decision to request a search warrant was undoubtedly vetted through the..."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds in the United States, a crucial step in the nation’s steady recovery from the pandemic and a boon to tens of millions of American families eager for a return to normalcy.
The authorization caps weeks of anticipation among parents, who have been grappling with how to conduct their lives when only the adults in a household are immunized. It removes an obstacle to school reopenings by reducing the threat of transmission in..."
"A COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, is safe and effective enough to give to younger teens, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday in authorizing its use.
The decision means adolescents ages 12 to 15 could qualify for shots as soon as Thursday, after the Wednesday meeting of an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
President Joe Biden said last week that 20,000 pharmacy locations are ready to begin vaccinating adolescents once the necessary approvals come through.
Shots also will..."
"If you have been anywhere within range of conservative talking points on either side of the Atlantic during the past few months, you are surely aware that “anti-wokeness” has become central to the right’s assault on their political enemies. There are various explanations for this phenomenon, ranging from not-so-secret pandering to racism and sexism to the absence of a substantive conservative agenda these days.
Personally, I think it’s catnip for the right in no small part because it enables culture warriors fighting such strange ideas as equality to pose as..."
"Hillary Rodham Clinton will seek the presidency for a second time, her advisers said Sunday, ending two years of speculation and coy denials and immediately establishing herself as the likely 2016 Democratic nominee.
The announcement came in emails from John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, to donors and others.
The announcement effectively began what could be one of the least contested races, without an incumbent, for the Democratic presidential nomination in rece"

"Forty-nine people are dead and scores more are injured after a heavily armed gunman clad in military-style gear opened fire during prayers at a mosque in the center of Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday. A second mosque was also targeted in what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called a well-planned “terrorist attack,” making for “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”
Portions of the ghastly attack were broadcast live on social media by a man who police confirmed had also released a manifesto railing against Muslims and immigrants. The 74-page document states..."
"The possibility of Texas Democrats staging a second walkout to again stop one of America’s most restrictive new voting measures grew louder Saturday, as hundreds of people waited hours to rail against the GOP’s plan in the largest turnout this year at the state Capitol.
As Republicans made clear they intended this weekend to advance a new election bill — which would prohibit 24-hour polling places, ban drop boxes and stop drive-thru voting — some Democrats who broke quorum in May are now describing it as their best, if not only, option..."
"Texas Democrats fled the state on Monday in a last-ditch effort to prevent the passage of a restrictive new voting law in the Republican-controlled legislature, heading to Washington to draw attention to what they portray as a damaging assault on the right to cast a ballot.
The group left Austin in midafternoon on a pair of chartered flights that were scheduled to arrive by the early evening. An official involved with the effort said more than 51 of the 67 State House Democrats members had signed on, enough to prevent..."
"President Joe Biden signed into law the most sweeping legislation aimed at preventing gun violence in 30 years at the White House on Saturday shortly before departing for Europe for a series of meetings with world leaders.
Biden called the signing of the legislation a ""monumental day"" and said it was proof that Democrats and Republicans could find common ground on important issues.
“God willing, it's going to save a lot of lives,"" he said.
The bill provides grants to states for “red flag” laws, enhances background checks to include juvenile records, and closes the “boyfriend..."
"When a major conflict like Ukraine breaks out, journalists always ask themselves: “Where should I station myself?” Kyiv? Moscow? Munich? Washington? In this case, my answer is none of these. The only place to be for understanding this war is inside Russian President Vladimir Putin’s head. Putin is the most powerful, unchecked Russian leader since Stalin, and the timing of this war is a product of his ambitions, strategies and grievances."
"The request by House Democrats for six years of Donald Trump's tax returns opens a serious new political, legal, constitutional and personal front in the party's battle to use its new majority to check a defiant President.
It is a bid to solve one of the most tantalizing and enduring mysteries of Trump's 2016 campaign and his presidency -- what is it in the President's unseen financial and business life that he doesn't want Americans to see?
The historic move, made official by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard..."

But the United States and its partners still face significant battles against the terrorist group, its affiliates and other networks that are less formally aligned with it elsewhere, in Afghanistan, West Africa and the Philippines.

"Ruth Bader Ginsburg has sided with the Supreme Court’s conservative justices in a criminal sentencing case that ended with a 5-4 decision.
The court determined a defendant can be sentenced for violating their supervised release — even if that release was to expire during their incarceration while facing new charges.

“Because I cannot agree that a person ‘is imprisoned in connection with a conviction’ before any conviction has occurred, I..."
"President Biden, seeking to assert leadership over the coronavirus pandemic, signed a string of executive orders and presidential directives on Thursday aimed at creating the kind of centralized authority that the Trump administration had shied away from.
The orders included new requirements for masks on interstate planes, trains and buses, the creation of a national testing board and mandatory quarantines for international travelers arriving in the United States. Mr. Biden predicted that the national death toll from Covid-19 would top 500,000 next month, refusing to play down the carnage that..."

"The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill calling on President Joe Biden to liquidate the seized assets of oligarchs linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fund efforts to help the Ukrainian people.
The ’’Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act,” introduced by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), was passed 417-8. The measure is symbolic, since it wouldn’t force Biden to do anything.
“It is hard to imagine giving Russia’s wealth back to Putin while Ukraine lies in ruin and Ukrainians are burying their dead,” Malinowski..."
"A bipartisan group of lawmakers said on Monday that they would move forward with legislation that would ban imports of Russian energy into the United States and suspend normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
The legislation is aimed at inflicting further financial pain on Russia and Belarus, which has been aiding the conflict, by cutting off Russia’s oil exports into the United States and giving President Biden the ability to increase tariffs on products from both countries."

"Florida's governor has signed a law that he called the ""strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement measure in the country."" The law was written in response to protests around the country following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. It provides new protections for police and increases the penalties for people who take part in property damage or violence during protests.
Florida experienced little of the violence seen elsewhere in the country last summer following Floyd's death. But Gov. Ron DeSantis said tougher laws were needed to make..."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed into law a controversial bill that aims to crack down on riots and property damage in the face of fierce opposition from Democrats in the state, who argue it will have a chilling effect on peaceful protests.

"President Biden said on Monday that the United States would end its combat mission in Iraq by the end of the year, shifting fully to an advisory and training role as America dials down its involvement in long-term conflicts in the Middle East.
“We’re not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat zone,” Mr. Biden said as he met with Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi of Iraq at the White House Monday.
The agreement to end the combat mission is largely symbolic, since U.S. troops no..."
"A bipartisan group of senators unveiled an approximately $908 billion stimulus proposal on Tuesday, aiming to break a months-long partisan impasse over providing emergency federal relief to the U.S. economy.
Congress has faced increasing pressure to approve additional economic relief since talks between the White House and House Democrats collapsed, first over the summer and then again in the fall ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
With negotiations among congressional leaders at an impasse, rank-and-file senators in both parties have for several weeks worked together on a proposal that..."

Specifically, the new guidance says, people who are fully vaccinated can visit indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or social distancing. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after they have gotten the second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or two weeks after receiving the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine).

The scope of Iran’s ongoing unrest, the worst in several years, still remains unclear as protesters in at least a dozen cities — venting anger over social repression and the country’s mounting crises — continue to encounter security and paramilitary forces.
To prevent protests from spreading, Iran’s biggest telecom operator..."
"In a move that could alter the minimum wage debate and improve the image of the world's largest retailer, Walmart announced it will raise the baseline wage of its current store employees to $10 per hour, bringing pay hikes to an estimated 500,000 workers.
The company said in an announcement on Thursday that it would raise its wage floor to $9 in April, followed by a second boost to $10 by next February.
The decision follows similar moves by other major retailers such as Gap and IKEA, but the sheer..."
"Students can safely sit just 3 feet apart in the classroom as long as they wear masks but should be kept the usual 6 feet away from one another at sporting events, assemblies, lunch or chorus practice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday in relaxing its COVID-19 guidelines.
The revised recommendations represent a turn away from the 6-foot standard that has sharply limited how many students some schools can accommodate. Some places have had to remove desks, stagger scheduling and take other steps to keep children apart...."
"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday is updating its physical distancing guidelines for children in schools from 6 feet to 3 feet.
The CDC has previously said schools should try to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between children, but in light of new data, the agency is now recommending most students maintain at least 3 feet of distance.
On Friday, the agency is releasing three new studies it says support distancing of 3 feet between students, so long as everyone is wearing a..."
"Florida voters will head to the polls on Tuesday to determine which candidates will have the chance to face off in this November’s general election. Voters will cast ballots in races for the governorship and Congress, all the way down to circuit courts and local school boards.
Democrats are competing to run against the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, and US senator Marco Rubio, both of whom are considered potential Republican presidential candidates for 2024. On the House side, a new congressional map drawn by DeSantis is expected to give Republicans a hefty..."
"The White House relented on Tuesday and said President Obama would sign a compromise bill giving Congress a voice on the proposed nuclear accord with Iran as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in rare unanimous agreement, moved the legislation to the full Senate for a vote.
An unusual alliance of Republican opponents of the nuclear deal and some of Mr. Obama’s strongest Democratic supporters demanded a congressional role as international negotiators work to turn this month’s nuclear framework into a final deal by June 30. White House officials insisted they..."
"After months of tensions with Congress over a bill giving the legislature a say in the potential Iran nuclear deal, the White House indicated Tuesday that the president would be willing to sign the compromise version of the measure.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the new version, which Democratic lobbying had watered down, in a vote Tuesday afternoon."
"The United States and the European Union have unveiled a plan to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels following the invasion of Ukraine.
US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the creation of the joint task force aimed at cutting the bloc’s reliance on Russian imports during a joint news conference in Brussels on Friday.
“Putin has used Russia’s energy resources … to manipulate its neighbours,” said Biden, who arrived in Europe this week to take part in several emergency meetings. “He’s used the..."
"President Trump's decision to block his Twitter followers for their political views is a violation of the First Amendment, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, saying that Trump's effort to silence his critics is not permissible under the U.S. Constitution because the digital space in which he engages with constituents is a public forum."
"Whoopi Goldberg has been suspended from “The View” over her on-air comment Monday that the Holocaust was “not about race.”
“Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,” ABC News President Kim Godwin said in a statement provided Tuesday to HuffPost. “While Whoopi has apologized, I’ve asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments. The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family and communities.”
During a discussion on the talk show about..."
"It seemed like an obvious political coup: scores of Republicans telling voters that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be safer than a Donald Trump one. Fifty of them signed an open letter warning that Trump “would put at risk our country’s national security.” Fifty more joined “Together for America,” a Clinton effort urging voters to “put country over party.”"
"Donald Trump’s grip on the GOP will tighten with a vote by House Republicans Wednesday to depose Representative Liz Cheney from her leadership post for her persistent rebuttals to Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.
The outcome of the closed-door vote of the 212-member Republican conference is largely settled. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and his chief deputy, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, are publicly supporting Cheney’s ouster and her replacement with New York Representative Elise Stefanik, a Trump loyalist. The former president also is..."
"Storm surge from Hurricane Ian began inundating several cities on the Southwest Florida coast on Wednesday afternoon, sweeping some homes off their foundations as it simultaneously pounded Florida with 155 mph winds.
Winds at that speed are the equivalent of an EF3 tornado, meteorologist Matthew Cappucci reported, and are expected to span at least 50 miles as Ian—the strongest storm of the season and one of the most powerful in history—wallops Florida.
While the whipping winds are a serious threat, the National Hurricane Center says that “catastrophic” storm surge of..."
"Washington (CNN)Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky expressed frustration with Republican leadership during the Senate impeachment trial Wednesday night after it was made clear Chief Justice John Roberts would not read his question that named the alleged Ukraine whistleblower, sources with knowledge of the situation said.
The development brought Roberts into an unusual position in the trial, where he has served in large part to guide the proceedings, not to decide or make any rulings on how they proceed."
"Presidential electors coast to coast are casting the votes that will formally choose Joe Biden as the nation’s next president.
In Nevada, the first battleground state won by Biden that voted on Monday, Democratic electors gave Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the state’s six electoral votes in a session held via Zoom because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Monday is the day set by law for the meeting of the Electoral College. In reality, electors were meeting in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to cast their ballots...."
"The mass shooting in Raleigh, N.C., that killed five people including a police officer was carried out by a 15-year-old who is now in critical condition, officials said on Friday.
The suspect, whose name has not been released, was taken into custody after a lengthy standoff, police said.
The victims include three women — Mary Marshall, 35; Susan Karnatz, 49; and Nicole Conners, 52 — along with 16-year-old James Roger Thompson and Gabriel Torres, 29, an off-duty police officer who was on his way to work, as member station WUNC..."
"The two police officers who were shot outside the Ferguson Police Department during a late-night demonstration were ambushed and ""lucky"" to be alive, the police chief of St. Louis County said Thursday, but he called for a ""measured response"" by officers to a community roiled by unrest.

Belmar said investigators with the department believed the weapon used was a han"
"Experts warned of mission creep after the president ordered US special forces to take a more active role but most White House hopefuls back greater intervention. Barack Obama’s announcement on Friday that American special forces will take a more active role in the war in Syria is for many critics of his foreign policy a confirmation that the US has inched deeper into a chaotic conflict.
It’s also an opportunity for presidential candidates to both praise and denounce him. And most Republican and Democratic presidential candidates propose doing even more..."
"President Obama’s decision to send a small team of United States commandos into Syria as part of the broader war against the Islamic State has raised new questions about his military strategy, its legal foundation and the way it has been sold to the American public.
After years in which Mr. Obama rejected “boots on the ground,” the deployment of up to 50 Special Operations troops to northern Syria is a relatively modest commitment. But coupled with the 3,500 troops now stationed next door in Iraq, it reflects continuing improvisation..."
"A working group is seriously considering measures backed by key law enforcement leaders that would require universal background checks for firearm buyers, track the movement and sale of weapons through a national database, strengthen mental health checks, and stiffen penalties for carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors."

"US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned Thursday health misinformation is ""a serious threat to public health,"" as administration officials grow increasingly concerned about misleading claims about coronavirus vaccines, leading to a confrontation with social media giant Facebook. ""I am urging all Americans to help slow the spread of health misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,"" Murthy wrote in a 22-page advisory released Thursday. ""Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health. It can cause confusion, sow mistrust, harm people's health, and undermine public health efforts. Limiting the spread of..."
"CHICAGO (AP) — She’s too ambitious. She’s not apologetic enough. She should smile more.
The debate over Joe Biden’s running mate has recently ticked through a familiar list of stereotypes about women in politics as the Democratic presidential candidate and his allies stumble through a search they had hoped would stand out for its inclusion and diversity.
Instead, the vice presidential vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that’s more attuned to gender and racial biases and willing to speak out. Some contend..."
"Black women have been betting on the Democratic Party since the civil rights era. It is time for the Democratic Party to bet on them.
That's why this month Joe Biden must select a Black woman as his running mate.
Just consider that 98% of Black women voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Pew Research Center. They voted Democratic in similar numbers in a down-ticket race the next year.
Black women also do the hard work of organizing, registering voters and turning them out to vote. Without Black..."

"The Biden administration has scrambled to devise a way to keep paying heightened unemployment benefits to an estimated 3.6 million Americans who stand to lose them soon in Republican-led states, but Labor Department officials have come to believe that the law does not allow them to do so.
With a federal intervention now unlikely, jobless Americans in at least 22 states including Arizona, Ohio and Texas are set to see their payments fall by $300 each week — or be wiped out entirely — as GOP governors try to force..."
"North Korea fired two ballistic missiles off its east coast Wednesday and South Korea said hours later that it had carried out a successful test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.
The rival launches intensified an arms race between the two countries amid stalled nuclear diplomacy with the United States and just two days after Pyongyang said it had tested a new cruise missile.
The first weapons activity by Kim Jong Un's regime in almost six months came as President Joe Biden's envoy for North Korea, Sung Kim, was in Tokyo for talks with Japan and South Korea..."
"During Donald Trump’s presidency, Trump hotels charged the Secret Service as much as $1,185 per night, more than five times the recommended government rate, and the high rates continued after he left office, according to an investigation released Monday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
Beginning in January 2017 through Sept. 15, 2021, the Secret Service received at least 40 waivers to let it spend more than the recommended per diem rates to stay at Trump properties to protect Trump as a president and former president, and also..."
"Offices are canceling holiday parties. Broadway performances are being shuttered because of breakthrough infections among the casts. College finals are being moved online.
Coronavirus cases are spiking again in New York City, past anything seen since the end of last winter’s surge, and in much of the United States, where the Delta variant remains by far the dominant version. Across the country, the average of new cases a day has jumped to more than 120,000 — a 40 percent increase from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database, and 70 percent more than when..."
"A pair of Senate Republican committee chairmen released a report Wednesday arguing that Hunter Biden’s board position with a Ukrainian energy company was “awkward,” “problematic” and interfered with “efficient execution of policy” for the Obama administration, but failed to demonstrate that it changed the administration’s policy toward Ukraine.
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) co-authored the report, which comes just weeks before the Nov. 3 election between President Trump and Joe Biden.
The GOP report concludes..."
"The longstanding conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas reignited last week after Israel launched airstrikes against what it called terrorist targets in Gaza. Israel explained that the offensive, which it calls ""Operation Pillar of Defense,"" was necessitated by increasing rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory."
"A federal appeals court said Wednesday that the Justice Department can resume using classified documents seized from former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate in its criminal investigation.
The Justice Department had appealed a ruling this month by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, that temporarily barred it from reviewing and using the seized materials for investigative purposes.
The appeals court panel, comprised of two Trump appointees and one Obama appointee, thoroughly rejected Trump’s position on the classified documents and parts of Cannon’s reasoning for issuing her original order...."
"President Trump will announce an executive action to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census, two senior administration officials have confirmed to CBS News. Mr. Trump announced a White House Rose Garden press conference on the topic for Thursday afternoon.
The anticipated announcement comes as the president exhibits frustration over the Supreme Court decision that his administration failed to provide adequate justification for adding the question. Multiple legal battles over the question are still playing out in lower courts.
It isn't yet clear exactly what kind of..."
"President Joe Biden warned Friday that Republicans will ""crash the economy next year"" if they win control of Congress, looking to blunt the edge that growing fears of a recession have given Republicans less than three weeks before the midterm elections.
Biden took aim at House Republican leaders who have suggested they might use the debt ceiling as ""leverage"" to achieve their goals on entitlements in a budget showdown under a Republican majority. The president singled out Social Security and Medicare. 
""If you're worried about the economy, you need to know this,"" Biden..."
"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was already held in favorable regard by the American public before the Supreme Court nominee sat for Senate confirmation hearings. But her popularity grew even more after the hearings, thanks to a tag team of Republicans who sought to portray her as soft on child pornography criminals, uncertain about the definition of a woman, and a fan of critical race theory.
Prior to the hearings, Judge Jackson held a 58 percent approval rating in a Gallup poll. And after nearly 24 hours of answering questions over two days, the percentage..."
"Iran is behind threatening, spoofed emails sent to voters, the officials said, but there was no indication that any votes themselves had been altered.
Iran and Russia have both obtained American voter registration data, top national security officials announced late on Wednesday, providing the first concrete evidence that the two countries are stepping in to try to influence the presidential election as it enters its final two weeks.
Iran used the information to send threatening, faked emails to voters, said John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, and Christopher A...."
"Iranian influence specialists are behind threatening emails sent to voters in Alaska and Florida, U.S. officials said on Wednesday evening and suggested that more such interference could be in store from Russia.
Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said the U.S. intelligence community believes Iranian and Russian operatives obtained voter-record information, which enabled Iran to target some people with intimidating emails based on party registration about how they'd better vote for President Trump ""or else.""
The senders posed as members of the white supremacist Proud Boys and claimed they had..."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday announced her first endorsement of a 2020 congressional primary challenger over a Democratic incumbent, throwing her high-profile support behind Marie Newman’s bid to unseat Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois.
Newman, who is backed by Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped elect Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, challenged conservative-leaning Lipinski for Illinois’s 3rd Congressional District seat last year, but lost by about 2,000 votes. The eight-term House member is one of the few Democrats with a record of opposing abortion rights and discrimination protections for LGBTQ..."
"President Donald Trump ordered 60 Russian diplomats the U.S. considers spies to leave the country in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K. and closed Russia’s consulate in Seattle, senior administration officials said Monday as European allies moved to take similar measures."
"China’s finance ministry announced on Monday evening that it was raising tariffs on a wide range of American goods to 20 percent or 25 percent from 10 percent, in the first Chinese move to retaliate over President Trump’s broader increase in tariffs on Chinese goods last Friday.
But the finance ministry delayed the implementation of its tariff increase until June 1, a delay of nearly three weeks that allows time for negotiators to make one last push for a deal. The delay roughly matches one that the Trump administration in..."
"On Saturday, President Donald Trump’s first full day in office, he gave a speech at CIA headquarters in which he lied about the size of the crowd at his inauguration and falsely claimed that he had never feuded with the U.S. intelligence community. Hours later, his press secretary emerged from the West Wing, lied about the size of the inaugural crowd and took no questions."
"Ireland was poised Saturday to become the first country to legalize same-sex marriage by national referendum, a vote that has highlighted the dramatic pace at which this traditionally conservative Catholic nation has changed in recent times.
No tallies or results have been officially released yet in the nation, which only decriminalized homosexuality 22 years ago. However, leading figures from both sides said voting patterns signal a major victory for the ""Yes"" vote.

"The mounting challenges at the border crashed President Joe Biden's first formal news conference Thursday afternoon, derailing White House hopes of keeping the event focused on the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The White House had made an advance effort to spotlight Biden's pandemic response, with a string of vaccination logistical funding announcements in the hours before it began. The president began the event by detailing a new vaccination target, after his initial goal of 100 million vaccines was reached last week."

Some cities and school districts are taking aggressive new measures."
"President-elect Joe Biden called Wednesday for the restoration of “simple decency” as a mob incited by his predecessor stormed the U.S. Capitol and delayed Congress from certifying the results of November’s election.
Biden had planned to deliver a speech focused on how to revive the economy and provide financial relief for small-business owners reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, giving routine political remarks from a theater in his native Delaware. But shortly before he was to begin speaking, demonstrators broke into the Capitol building, reaching as far as the Senate floor."
"Facebook on Wednesday removed a video message by President Trump, citing ""the risk of ongoing violence.""
Facebook executive Guy Rosen called the pro-Trump mob swarming the Capitol an ""emergency situation,"" suggesting the president's video message had the potential of worsening the chaos.

According to the Banner Health hospital system in Phoenix, the couple, both in their sixties, ingested chloroquine phosphate, ""an additive commonly used at aquariums to clean fish tanks."" One aquarium supply store online described it as a ""wonder drug"" that was once..."
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Wednesday announced he was reviving parts of the state’s sweeping lockdown, ordering bars to close and a range of other service-sector businesses in 19 counties to cease indoor operations amid a spike in coronavirus cases.

Elsewhere, North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida continue to report record virus infection records, according to data tracked by The Washington Post. The Tar Heel state reported more than 1,800 cases, Louisiana tallied..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The reopening of Tucson’s historic Hotel Congress lasted less than a month.
General manager Todd Hanley on June 4 ended a two-month coronavirus lockdown and reopened the 39-room hotel at half-capacity, along with an adjoining restaurant for outdoor dining. Yet with reported COVID-19 cases spiking across Arizona, Hanley made the painful decision last weekend to give up, for now.
“We are closing everything,” he said. “We are going to live to fight another day.’’"
"Recent years have been hard on a Supreme Court trying to maintain its reputation for impartial justice. Time and again, the justices have jumped into cases that advantage one major political party at the expense of the other.
In virtually all of them — on issues ranging from the 2000 Florida recount to money in elections to restrictive voter ID laws to modern interpretations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act — the court has found a rationale for doing the Republican Party’s bidding."
"Senate leaders and Trump administration officials are resuming talks Monday morning on a giant stimulus bill aimed at propping up an economy hard-hit by the coronavirus, after weekend negotiations failed to produce a deal.
Senate Democrats voted Sunday evening to block the bill from advancing, infuriating Republicans. Democrats have alleged the bill does too much to help prop up businesses without directing enough money to households, hospitals and health professionals. White House officials have acknowledged the unprecedented assistance the legislation would steer toward corporations but they have said this money..."
"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said on Sunday that while the disease is scary, “the plain truth is, we can stop Ebola. We know how to control it.”
His comments on ABC’s “This Week” came the day after an American doctor who was stricken with the disease while working in Liberia was flown into the United States and transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.
“Ebola’s scary, and it’s understandable that with a deadly disease, people are concerned,” Frieden said.
The key to stopping its spread,..."
"The disturbing feature of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa isn't just that it's the largest and deadliest: it's also that so many health workers have lost their lives while caring for the sick.
The death toll right now is at least 60, according to the World Health Organization. To put that into context, in the second biggest outbreak in history—which took place in 1976 in Zaire—only 11 medical personnel died. And that was the first recorded outbreak in history, when measures to prevent transmission of the virus weren't..."
"President Biden declared in his inaugural address that our prospects for much-needed “unity” are threatened by various political forces. Among them, he said, are racism, nativism, political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism.
Republicans promptly decided that in condemning those things, Biden was actually talking about them.
Republican officials and their media allies are now widely condemning these words as an attack on themselves and their voters. The obvious trick is to game the media into saying Biden is already reneging on his unity promise by being divisive.
But there’s..."
"Stephen K. Bannon is expected to surrender to state prosecutors on Thursday to face a new criminal indictment, people familiar with the matter said, weeks after he was convicted of contempt of Congress and nearly two years after he received a federal pardon from President Donald Trump in a federal fraud case.
The precise details of the state case could not be confirmed Tuesday evening. But people familiar with the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sealed indictment, suggested the prosecution will likely mirror aspects of..."
"Richard Overton, 108, is thought to be the oldest living veteran in the United States. But he’s as active as ever.
He begins his days with a tablespoon of whiskey in his coffee and smokes cigars daily, USA Today reported in 2013. “I drink whiskey in my coffee. Sometimes I drink it straight,” Overton told CNN. “I smoke my cigars, blow the smoke out — I don’t swallow it.”"
"On Sept. 14, an Iowa man named Carson King went viral after holding a sign on ESPN’s “College GameDay” asking for donations on Venmo to pay for his “Busch Light Supply.” When cash unexpectedly poured in, King decided to give it to a local children’s hospital instead of buying beer, leading Venmo and Anheuser-Busch to pledge matching donations.
That’s when Des Moines Register reporter Aaron Calvin set out to profile King — and found two offensive tweets the 24-year-old had sent when he was 16."
"The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to condemn anti-Semitism, along with a litany of bigotries against Muslims, immigrants, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, LGBT people, and members of other religious minorities. The resolution followed a week of drama in the Democratic Party, with members clashing over yet another controversial comment on Israel by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. In a recent panel discussion, she suggested that pro-Israel political groups in Washington “push allegiance to a foreign country,” seeming to echo the classically anti-Semitic allegation that Jews are more..."
"President Joe Biden on Friday signed an emergency determination that officials said would speed refugee admissions to the U.S., but he did not immediately lift his predecessor’s historically low cap of 15,000 refugees for this year.
Biden, instead, is adjusting the allocation limits set by former President Donald Trump, which officials said have been the driving factor in limiting refugee admissions. The new allocations provide more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Central America and lift Trump’s restrictions on resettlements from Somalia, Syria and Yemen."
"The Senate on Thursday confirmed California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as President Joe Biden’s health secretary, filling a key position in the administration’s coronavirus response and its ambitious push to lower drug costs, expand insurance coverage, and eliminate racial disparities in medical care.
The 50-49 largely party-line vote makes the 63-year-old Becerra the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services. The $1.4 trillion agency encompasses health insurance programs, drug safety and approvals, advanced medical research, substance abuse treatment, and the welfare of children, including hundreds of..."
"Rolling Stone's high-profile story about sexual assault on campus appears to be falling apart in the wake of serious questions raised about a horrifying alleged gang-rape used as its central example.
It is a depressing certainty that this story will be used for years to come as a defense by those who do not want to believe rape victims' allegations. But that is the wrong lesson to draw. Rather, this story should be a reminder of how difficult it is to accurately report on traumatic events — and the heightened..."
"Two weeks ago, a stunning account in Rolling Stone magazine about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia sent the nation reeling. The stomach-churning story led to a police and university investigation, student protests, a temporary ban on fraternities and sororities at the school — and, eventually, tremors in the media that dared to ask: Was the account to be believed? Sixteen days later, another bombshell: Rolling Stone backed off the story.
On Friday, the magazine said it discovered new information that made it lose faith in the..."
"Joe Biden refused calls to apologize Wednesday for saying that the Senate “got things done” with “civility” even when the body included segregationists with whom he disagreed.
His rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, including the two major black candidates in the contest, roundly criticized Biden’s comments. But Biden didn’t back down and was particularly defiant in the face of criticism from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who said the former vice president should apologize for his remarks.
Biden countered that it was Booker who should apologize because the senator..."
"(CNN)An unapologetic Joe Biden defended his remarks about working with segregationist senators on Wednesday, telling reporters that ""there's not a racist bone in my body.""
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of the former vice president's rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, had called on Biden to apologize for remarks he had made at a fundraiser Tuesday evening in New York.
""Apologize for what?"" Biden told CNN when asked about Booker's call outside a fundraiser Wednesday evening in Rockville, Maryland."
"There are a lot of things conservatives at the Values Voter Summit don't like about House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who announced his resignation on Friday. He has been in politics for too long, some said, and he is too willing to compromise. He gives up too easily, rather than fighting for conservative values, they said.
But there's another person those criticisms apply to: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). They're not happy with him, either.
""Here's what I say in response to Speaker Boehner stepping down: Mitch McConnell, it..."
"Conservatives at the Values Voter Summit cheered Friday morning when they learned that House Speaker John Boehner was retiring. Friday afternoon, they cheered again when someone suggested the next establishment Republican to lose his job should be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
""Here's what I say in response to Speaker Boehner stepping down. Mitch McConnell, it is now your turn,"" Louisiana Gov. and GOP presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said to raucous applause.
After the news of Boehner's resignation, Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon told reporters he had texted his fellow conservative..."
"Days before the holidays, Congress has passed a $900 billion bill to extend unemployment insurance, pay out additional stimulus checks to Americans and provide more loans for small businesses.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed the relief bill Monday night on a vote of 359-53, just hours after the final legislative text was released to members. A few hours later, the Republican-controlled US Senate did the same with a vote of 92-6.
“It is a good bipartisan bill,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor Monday morning, mentioning provisions..."
"Maybe you’ve heard that people are mad about Black actors being cast in Lord of the Rings. Or Game of Thrones. Or maybe it was Star Wars. Or perhaps Thor. Wait, maybe it was Titans, or Superman. The Witcher? Or maybe you heard that people are angry that Black Panther got made in the first place, because Wakanda is fictional, unlike one of those fantasy countries authors seem to think will seem more mysterious if you add enough accents or apostrophes, like Warthéréth’rién. (I just made that up.) Maybe you’re..."
"President Trump on Friday made his salesman's pitch for America before an international crowd of corporate and political titans, and took credit for its economic success, yet he was shadowed by clouds from home — news of his heightened jeopardy in the Russia probe and opposition to his immigration plan."
"After a barrage of criticism, the New York Times said Sunday it was deeply sorry about publishing an anti-Semitic cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog on a leash held by a blind President Donald Trump.
It is promising ""significant changes"" in its decision making process in the wake of the embarrassment.
The cartoon appeared in the opinion section of the international print edition of the paper next to a column by Thomas Friedman about immigration.

“Look, there is no federal solution,” he said after joining the White House covid-19 response team’s regular call with the National Governors Association on Monday. “This gets solved at the state level.”
In response to a question from Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) about production and distribution by the federal government of rapid coronavirus tests, Biden said: “We just have to stay focused and continue to work..."
"President Trump signed an executive order on Monday intended to give Americans more information about the cost and quality of health-care services to help them comparison shop before they get care.
The order is pegged to the gathering momentum of the 2020 election in which voters are eager for political leaders to lower what they pay for care. It is based on the idea, in fashion lately with both Republicans and Democrats, that greater transparency in hospital and other health-care prices will lead consumers to make better choices about where..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, acquiescing to mounting pressure from fellow Democrats and plunging a deeply divided nation into an election year clash between Congress and the commander in chief.
The probe centers on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government for his reelection. Pelosi said such actions would mark a “betrayal of his oath of office” and declared: “No one is above the law.”
Pelosi’s brief statement capped a frenetic..."
"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, saying that he had betrayed his oath of office and the nation’s security in seeking to enlist a foreign power for his own political gain.
“The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution,” she said after emerging from a meeting of House Democrats in the basement of the Capitol. Mr. Trump, she said, “must be held accountable — no one is above the law.”

"The Census Bureau announced it will miss Thursday's deadline to produce the population count used to divide seats in Congress between the states.
The Wednesday announcement was expected, and the key question remains whether the Census Bureau and Commerce Department will present the tally to President Donald Trump prior to his departure from office on January 20. There are no penalties associated with missing the December 31 deadline.
The Census Bureau said in a statement that it plans ""to deliver a complete and accurate state population count for apportionment..."
"In another blow to the US economy, prices at the pump soared to fresh record highs.
The national average price for regular gasoline climbed more than four cents on Tuesday to $4.37 a gallon, according to AAA. That takes out the prior record of $4.33 set on March 11.
The gas spike — prices are up 17 cents in the past week alone — will only add to inflationary pressures that have raised recession fears, rocked financial markets and soured Americans' views on the economy.
The national average dipped to as low as..."
"WASHINGTON — Google said Thursday that it had reached a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board over complaints from multiple employees who say the company has stymied dissent, including one who has said he was fired for being an outspoken conservative.

"What do an aeronautical engineer, a psychiatrist and a lawyer all have in common? The obvious answers are advanced degrees and exorbitant student loans, but at the heart of their success is a solid education, dating to before they could even complete math equations. Those degrees didn't appear out of nowhere, and educators can take some credit for inspiring and training these professionals along the way.
Instead of rolling our eyes at Biden for exploring how to keep community college students in school, maybe we can try to build on..."
"President Donald Trump and John McCain's long-running feud is back in the spotlight following reports that White House and lower-level US Navy officials traded emails about keeping a warship named from the late senator's father and grandfather out of sight ahead of the President's trip to Japan.
Two Navy officials confirmed to CNN Wednesday night that the White House Military Office asked lower-level US Navy officials about keeping the ship out of view. One of the Navy officials further clarified Thursday morning that the discussion included obscuring the ship or..."
"President Joe Biden and his administration are putting on a master’s class in ethics in the federal investigation into the business dealings of the president’s son Hunter Biden. As the investigation heats up, Biden’s “hands-off” approach versus Donald Trump’s “hands everywhere” approach is starkly illustrated by Trump’s shoutout to Russian President Vladimir Putin to release dirt on Hunter Biden. The move continues Trump’s long-standing practice of appealing for foreign interference in American politics.  
From his “Russia, if you’re listening” remark about finding Hillary Clinton’s missing emails to his repeatedly asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr..."

The results, projected by the Associated Press Tuesday night, cement the general election race to succeed Governor Charlie Baker, the state’s second-term Republican who is not seeking reelection.
The matchup will top a ballot of potentially history-making races. Healey’s..."
The Army has halted forcible discharges of soldiers who were recruited through a program that offers citizenship to skilled immigrants in exchange for military service. But it is not clear whether the step puts an end to the expulsion policy or is just a pause in the Army’s effort to curtail a program that its leaders say poses a security risk.

Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was cleared of all charges except for posing for photos with the dead body of the captive in a verdict that is a major blow to military prosecutors. It took the jury less than two days of deliberations to reach its verdict.

"International efforts to defuse the standoff over Ukraine intensified Monday, with French President Emmanuel Macron holding talks in Moscow and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington to coordinate policies as fears of a Russian invasion mounted.
The buildup of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine has fueled Western worries of a possible offensive. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Sunday that Russia could invade Ukraine “any day,” triggering a conflict that would come at an “enormous human cost.”
Russia has denied any plans to attack its neighbor but demands..."

Apparent corroboration surfaced this week for elements of two accusations made by Biden’s former Senate aide Tara Reade, one involving harassment and the second a sexual assault. Biden has not commented on the allegations, but his campaign has denied them and pointed to his record on women’s rights and..."
"President Joe Biden is caught between a hard place and an even harder one when it comes to immigration.
Biden embraced major progressive policy goals on the issue after he won the Democratic nomination, and he has begun enacting some.

Much of the anger is centered on the administration’s immigration point person, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

"Thirty-eight minutes into his opening statement during Wednesday's impeachment hearing, Amb. Bill Taylor, the career foreign service officer and top US diplomat to Ukraine, paused, took a drink of water, and delivered the day's biggest bombshell.
Less than a week earlier, Taylor learned that a member of his staff had overheard President Donald Trump discussing ""the investigations"" in Ukraine while on the phone with EU ambassador Gordon Sondland. That newly disclosed call took place on July 26, one day after the now infamous call between Trump and new Ukrainian president..."

"Virginia voters chose Republican Glenn Youngkin as their next governor, a dramatic reversal for a state that had appeared solidly Democratic in recent years and a significant loss for President Biden and the party’s establishment.
Former Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe came up short in his bid to become only the second Virginia governor since the Civil War to win a second term, with key suburban districts joining rural parts of the state in favoring Youngkin by a narrow margin.
Republicans appeared to sweep the other statewide races, with Winsome Sears winning for lieutenant governor..."

"In two unsigned opinions Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of police officers seeking qualified immunity from allegations of excessive force.
In both cases, the justices overturned lower court decisions that went against the officers.
The rulings -- and the fact that no justice publicly dissented -- suggests that the court is not willing, at least for now, to radically transform how it considers qualified immunity cases.
Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine, developed by the courts, that shields law enforcement from liability for constitutional violations including allegations of excessive force...."

"When a geopolitical crisis sent gasoline prices skyrocketing four decades ago, President Carter called on Americans to achieve “energy independence” from Middle Eastern oil exporters. He installed solar panels on the White House, donned a cardigan sweater to stay warm and took steps to boost domestic oil production.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has again upended global energy supplies, threatening to raise gas prices that are already higher than ever in California. The U.S. oil industry wants President Biden to ease restrictions on drilling, and Europe has already started importing more fossil fuel from the United States..."

"Former Dallas police Officer Amber Guyger was found guilty of murder on Tuesday for fatally shooting her neighbor, Botham Jean, after thinking he was an intruder when she mistakenly entered his apartment.
Guyger, who has been out on a $300,000 bond, faces a maximum of life in prison. She was not immediately taken into custody and is awaiting sentencing scheduled for later Tuesday afternoon.
There was an audible gasp in the packed courtroom as state District Judge Tammy Kemp read the jury's decision, and Jean's family later walked out crying..."
"A Dallas jury has found former police Officer Amber Guyger guilty of murder for fatally shooting a neighbor who lived in the apartment directly above hers last year. She had testified that she entered Botham Jean's unit after a long day at work, thinking it was her own home and that he was an intruder.
The jury took five hours to decide Guyger had committed murder, rather than a lesser charge of manslaughter. Jurors will begin considering sentencing options Tuesday afternoon. Guyger faces a possible penalty of up to 99..."

Here were some of the key findings:
Small gatherings: Fewer people avoiding small gatherings than were doing so last month, one survey found.
Around 74% of Americans say they’re avoiding small gatherings — that's down slightly from 80% who said so in mid-April, an indication that some are starting to break their quarantines and return to their lives.
The avoidance of small gatherings has decreased mostly among independents and Republicans..."
"WASHINGTON — Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote a letter Monday calling on Congress to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, seeking to jump-start a debate on a bipartisan path to bolstering voting access.

"At last it’s official after countless unsourced news reports and rumors: spectators from abroad will be barred from the postponed Tokyo Olympics when they open in four months.
The decision was announced Saturday after an online meeting of the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese government, the Tokyo government, the International Paralympic Committee, and local organizers.
Officials said the risk was too great to admit ticket holders from overseas during a pandemic. The Japanese public has also opposed fans from abroad. Several surveys have shown that up to 80% oppose holding..."

"The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump's name will appear on every mailed stimulus check, a move that senior IRS officials said would delay at least the first round of paper checks.
The Treasury will print ""President Donald J.Trump"" on the memo line of every paper check, because only career Treasury Department officials can legally sign the checks, The Washington Post first reported. It will be the first time a president's name has ever appeared on a government payment to the public."
"WASHINGTON – When Americans receive their anxiously awaited checks from the federal government, which are being sent out to help mitigate the economic hardships caused by the coronavirus outbreak, they may notice the words ""President Donald J. Trump"" have been added at the bottom.
Trump suggested to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin the idea of adding his signature to the $1,200 paper checks, and the department agreed Monday to add his printed name (but not his actual autograph)."
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday announced the introduction of a bill that would place a national freeze on handgun ownership across Canada.

"About 29,000 people signed up for health insurance through HealthCare.gov on Sunday and Monday — a figure that surpasses the total for the whole month of October, an official familiar with the program told POLITICO.

Nearly 2,200 abortions were reported by Texas providers in September after a new law took effect that bans the procedure once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy and when many do not know they are pregnant. The law is without exception in cases of rape or incest.
The figures were released this month by the Texas..."

"President Joe Biden joked that people who think they needed guns to take on the US government would actually need nuclear weapons.
In a speech on Wednesday that outlined his plan to combat gun violence, Biden said, ""If you wanted or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.""

"HONG KONG — While China’s state-run media has urged calm and praised the official response to the coronavirus outbreak, a different story is playing out across the country’s tightly controlled social media networks.
In the digital world, China’s citizens are expressing panic and frustration. They are overcoming a lack of reporting in the official media by sharing their own videos and information — sometimes inaccurately.
Some are even evading censors, who commonly stifle criticism of the government, to register complaints about how officials have handled the crisis. They have criticized..."
"As the Trump administration signals a willingness to build “herd immunity” by purposely allowing the coronavirus to spread, major scientific organizations are denouncing a plan they say would be life-threatening and practically impossible.

The authors discussed the strategy in a meeting with two top White House officials last week.
This week, top US heath official Anthony Fauci, the head of..."
"Mitt Romney, 65, has spent the better part of a decade running for president. And as the son of a Michigan governor who headed a Detroit auto company, he's been in the public eye much longer.
Yet the former Massachusetts governor has remained an enigma to many voters, his political positions malleable, and much of his business and private life — including his Mormon religion — intentionally obscured."
Republican leadership's first effort to sell an Obamacare replacement plan has given rise to an unusual consensus in Washington. Officials on both sides of the aisle -- including disparate factions within parties -- and influential outside groups seem to be in agreement: the bill in its current form will never make it to the White House.

The building seemed to warm its patch of a frozen National Mall, alongside the chilly phalanx of gray stone behemoths, nearly all classically designed.
Style-wise, I don’t know what to call the museum’s architecture. David Adjaye, the Ghanaian-British architect, led the design team. The building is classicizing, with its base and capital, at the same time that those patterns on..."

"It’s hard to believe now, but before Donald Trump became the G.O.P.’s presidential nominee in 2016, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was widely seen as a champion of the “reformicons” — conservatives who wanted the Republican Party to become more moderate and flexible, to move beyond its obsessive focus on cutting taxes for the rich and slashing benefits for the poor. Since then, however, Rubio has become a pathetic figure — not just a Trump toady, but someone who routinely tweets out stuff like this: “The $3.5 trillion Biden plan isn’t..."

The changes also paved the way for the publication, which is affiliated with the secretive and relatively obscure Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, to become a leading purveyor of right-wing misinformation."

If you start to think about the situation beyond the press release, it can get pretty disturbing pretty quickly. It reinforces how supremely screwed up the entire post-Roe situation is, as well as the setup of the United..."

"President Donald Trump is clearly very frustrated with the non-stop coverage of the chaos that has consumed his first six months in office. Just last week, he oversaw the collapse of Republicans’ efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, his new communications director went on a nasty tirade and he, along with Trump’s chief of staff, was later dumped. That’s why Trump’s middle son, Eric, recently ran to his Fox News safe space hosted by Sean Hannity to demand, “I want somebody to start fighting for him.”"
"It’s the inflation you’re not supposed to see.
From toilet paper to yogurt and coffee to corn chips, manufacturers are quietly shrinking package sizes without lowering prices. It’s dubbed “shrinkflation,” and it’s accelerating worldwide.
In the U.S., a small box of Kleenex now has 60 tissues; a few months ago, it had 65. Chobani Flips yogurts have shrunk from 5.3 ounces to 4.5 ounces. In the U.K., Nestle slimmed down its Nescafe Azera Americano coffee tins from 100 grams to 90 grams. In India, a bar of Vim dish soap..."
"Groceries are becoming more expensive. What people may not have noticed is they’re getting smaller too. By reducing the size of, say, a jar of jam, a food company can effectively charge more for it while avoiding a sticker price hike that would dent sales. It’s not a new tactic, but “shrinkflation” is back in vogue now the industry is grappling with soaring costs of everything from wheat to vegetable oils and energy. 
1. When did this begin? 
Humorist Art Buchwald was among the first to draw attention to the..."
"As the number of people handling the Benghazi talking points grew, the amount of information the document offered shrank.
Emails and documents released by the White House Wednesday reveal an editing process that valued caution over comprehensiveness as officials worked to remove language that would have assigned blame for the attack or suggested ways the incident could have been prevented. The release also showed that the CIA, and not the State Department, made the decision to scrub references to Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda-linked groups and prior terrorist attacks in..."
"President Joe Biden was heard calling a reporter from the Fox channel a ""stupid son of a bitch"" on a hot microphone following a White House event Monday afternoon.
The President's profane remark came as reporters were shouting questions while exiting the East Room following a White House Competition Council meeting on efforts to lower prices.
Fox White House Correspondent Peter Doocy asked Biden, ""Would you take a question on inflation ... ? Do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?""
""It's a great asset -- more inflation,"" Biden..."
"In his announcement Wednesday that he wouldn't sign a ""religious freedom"" bill that had reached his desk, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) offered a personal example of the contentiousness of the issue.
""My son Seth signed the petition asking me to veto the bill,"" he said.
Given Hutchinson's son's politics, that's not a big surprise. Seth Hutchinson is an organizer with the Texas State Employees Union and has been ""a progressive since college days,"" according to this Arkansas Times story."
"America's immediate political future will turn on this critical point: whether drivers stung by record gas prices blame Russian President Vladimir Putin or US President Joe Biden.
A staggering surge in the elevated cost of filling up since Russia invaded Ukraine represents another gut punch for consumers already swamped by a 40-year peak in inflation coming out of the pandemic.
And Biden acknowledged on Tuesday there is more pain to come, telling reporters his executive order banning imports of Russian energy signed Tuesday will heap more pain on gasoline prices ahead of spring break and summer vacation.
""They're..."
"As investigators continued to search for clues as to why a Metro-North Railroad passenger train flew off the tracks on Sunday morning, killing four people and injuring dozens more, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday morning that it appeared that the train was traveling too fast as it hit a curve in the tracks."
"As President Trump rushes to reopen the economy, a battle has erupted between the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the agency’s detailed guidelines to help schools, restaurants, churches and other establishments safely reopen.
A copy of the C.D.C. guidance obtained by The New York Times includes sections for child care programs, schools and day camps, churches and other “communities of faith,” employers with vulnerable workers, restaurants and bars, and mass transit administrators. The recommendations include using disposable dishes and utensils at restaurants, closing every..."
"Four years ago, state Democrats entered the final stretch before the election with a sense of momentum as polls showed a neck-and-neck race between Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams before the Republican scored his narrow victory.
Now, Democrats are entering the last hours of the rematch on edge. Kemp has a solid lead in most public polls, as do down-ticket Republican contenders. The closest race is between Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, which could wind up in a December runoff if no one gets a majority of..."
"President Donald Trump threatened to veto must-pass defense policy legislation on Tuesday unless lawmakers agree to repeal a legal shield for social media companies, a move that one senior House staffer called ""a total non-starter"" for Democrats.
Trump's push to repeal the protections, known as Section 230, has become the most contentious remaining issue in talks on the National Defense Authorization Act. The president ratcheted up the pressure on Congress in a pair of tweets Tuesday night, threatening to nix the $740 billion bill unless it includes the repeal.
""Section..."
"Donald Trump called Robert Mueller’s investigators a “hit squad” on Saturday, joining rightwing outcry over Department of Justice documents that indicated members of the Russia investigation wiped information from at least 15 phones.
“So now we find out that the entire Mueller ‘hit squad’ illegally wiped their phones clean just prior to the investigation of them,” the president wrote on Twitter.
The DoJ records say the phones were wiped due to damage, hardware problems and missing passwords.
On Friday, a Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, demanded a new investigation..."
"— Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen were found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and public corruption Thursday in a case alleging they traded access to the governor's office for $165,000 in loans and luxury gifts from a businessman seeking to win backing from the powerful couple for one of his company's nutritional supplements.
The former governor was found guilty on 11 federal charges, his wife on nine. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 6. Families members wept as the verdicts were read.
The jury began deliberations..."
"A federal jury Thursday found former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, guilty of public corruption — sending a message that they believed the couple sold the office once occupied by Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson to a free spending Richmond businessman for golf outings, lavish vacations and $120,000 in sweetheart loans."
"Tensions and emotions are running high in the U.S. after the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion published by Politico suggested that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established abortion rights nationwide, could be overturned this summer.
However, the U.S. is not alone in having a heated debate about abortion, and laws on the procedure differ in countries around the world. Regardless of the laws surrounding abortion, rates are similar in countries where abortion is restricted and those where the procedure is largely legal, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion..."
"President Joe Biden's plan to reduce the price of gas by allowing the sale of higher-ethanol fuel this summer may make corn farmers and their elected representatives happy. But the move also has irked environmentalists who see ethanol as a climate-change villain.
Biden made his announcement Tuesday during a trip to Iowa, where corn — and ethanol — are crucial to the state economy. He said the Environmental Protection Agency would issue an emergency waiver from the Clean Air Act that will permit the sale of gasoline that is 15 percent ethanol,..."
"Hurricane Ian made landfall near Georgetown, South Carolina, Friday afternoon with sustained winds of 85 mph, battering the state with heavy rain and life-threatening storm surge after killing at least 42 people in Florida and leaving behind a trail of apocalyptic destruction.
Ian, which restrengthened in the Atlantic, is unleashing lethal flooding and enough force to alter the coastal landscape, but it’s expected to rapidly transition into a post-tropical system, with a decrease in its strongest winds as it pushes inland.
“This is a dangerous storm that will bring high winds and..."
"Donald J. Trump came into South Carolina with momentum after a big win in New Hampshire — and he seemed to try his best to undercut himself. He attacked George W. Bush, a popular figure in the state, for his handling of terrorism and the Iraq war. He repeatedly picked fights with the well-liked Gov. Nikki R. Haley. He held forth on national television about his friendships with Howard Stern and Michael Jackson."
"In one sense, it's immaterial whether the accused killer in the Atlanta spa shootings admits to a racist motivation. Asian Americans, already traumatized by a rising tide of hate, violence and rhetoric, have been living in fear for months.
The murders of eight people, including six Asian women, among them four South Koreans, further disoriented and horrified a community already unfairly stigmatized by racial association during a pandemic that originated in China. And they laid bare for the rest of the country the agony of yet another minority group left..."
"With six of the eight victims killed in recent shootings in Atlanta identified as of Asian descent, Asian Americans and lawmakers across the country have reported increased fear of attacks on their communities, amid an uptick in racially motivated attacks.
The question of motive swirling around the spa shootings is yet to be answered by law enforcement but it has drawn attention to how hate crimes are defined.
The suspect was arrested and charged with murder and assault after shootings at three Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday. Most of those..."
"President Joe Biden will take part in a remembrance of one of the nation’s darkest — and largely forgotten — moments of racial violence when he helps commemorate the 100th anniversary of the destruction of a thriving Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Biden’s visit Tuesday, in which he will grieve for the hundreds of Black people killed by a white mob a century ago, comes amid a national reckoning on racial justice. And it will stand in stark contrast to the most recent visit to Tulsa by a president, which took place last year.
Biden..."
"One hundred years after a white mob burned ""Black Wall Street"" to the ground, killing and injuring an estimated hundreds of African Americans and forcing thousands from their homes, President Joe Biden will visit Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday to commemorate one of the bloodiest race massacres in U.S. history. 
Biden will deliver remarks on the 100-year anniversary and speak to survivors of the attack, who are now between the ages of 101 and 107. Only three remain.
On Monday, the White House issued a proclamation in which Biden called on Americans ""to..."
"Anyone hoping President Joe Biden's first formal news conference Thursday would produce a series of gaffes and misstatements must be deeply disappointed. Americans who want a competent, coherent, focused President should feel reassured.
Biden made news by answering a question he had dodged before -- the one about a second term (he is 78). ""My plan,"" he told reporters, ""is to run for reelection in 2024."" He also made news on the pandemic, announcing he is doubling the initial goal of administering 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days,..."
"President Joe Biden arrived Friday in Saudi Arabia where he met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a controversial sitdown he had earlier insisted would not take place.
The crown prince greeted Biden as he arrived at the royal palace where the two leaders exchanged a fist bump, but no handshake.
Biden has alternated between handshakes and fist bumps throughout the four days of his Middle East swing after the White House said he would “minimize contact” during the trip as a Covid precaution.
Ahead of the meeting with the crown..."
"Facebook, now Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he thinks the FBI is a ""legitimate institution"" amid far-right GOP figures calling for the agency to be defunded following its raid of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.
During a 3-hour segment on podcaster Joe Rogan's program, Rogan asked Zuckerberg how his company handles content that has heavy news attention, such as the controversial late 2020 New York Post story involving the laptop of now-President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and if Facebook ""censored that as well.""
Zuckerberg said the FBI had already approached..."
"China on Tuesday hailed a virtual meeting between President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden, saying they had a candid and constructive exchange that sent a strong signal to the world.
The positive description of the meeting came in sharp contrast to heated exchanges between the two nations earlier this year. The talks appeared to mark what both sides hoped would be a turnaround in relations, though major differences remain.
“If China-U.S. relations cannot return to the past, they should face the future,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said...."
"When Chinese President Xi Jinping beamed into the White House on Monday evening for a virtual summit with President Joe Biden, the two men needed no introduction.
""We've spent an awful lot of time talking to one another, and I hope we can have a candid conversation tonight as well,"" Biden said as the talks got underway, sitting at the head of the Roosevelt Room table as Xi's visage was broadcast on a pair of television screens.
From his seat in a cavernous room inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi was..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a Virginia school board’s appeal to reinstate its transgender bathroom ban.
Over two dissenting votes, the justices left in place lower court rulings that found the policy unconstitutional. The case involved former high school student Gavin Grimm, who filed a federal lawsuit after he was told he could not use the boys bathroom at his public high school. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas voted to hear the board’s appeal.
The Gloucester County, Virginia, school board’s policy required Grimm to use restrooms that corresponded with his..."
"The Supreme Court declined to hear a legal battle over the rights of transgender students on Monday, handing a victory to Gavin Grimm over the Virginia school board that denied him the right to use the boys’ restroom.
As is its custom, the court did not say why it was rejecting the appeal of the Gloucester County school district. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have accepted the case.
The court’s decision not to take up the case does not establish a national precedent, nor..."
"Boris Johnson's path to his self-imposed Brexit deadline just keeps getting rockier.
On Tuesday, less than two months from the date he set for the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union — with or without a deal on the terms of the breakup — the British prime minister suffered another significant blow to his fraying support in Parliament: Phillip Lee, a fellow Tory, defected from Johnson's Conservative Party in a dramatic scene in the House of Commons."
"Boris Johnson has suffered a humiliating defeat in the House of Commons as former Tory cabinet ministers banded together with Labour MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable.
The prime minister is poised to ask MPs on Wednesday to support an October general election after losing a vote paving the way for a rebel bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit."
"Republicans enter the final weeks of the contest for control of Congress with a narrow but distinct advantage as the economy and inflation have surged as the dominant concerns, giving the party momentum to take back power from Democrats in next month’s midterm elections, a New York Times/Siena College poll has found.
The poll shows that 49 percent of likely voters said they planned to vote for a Republican to represent them in Congress on Nov. 8, compared with 45 percent who planned to vote for a Democrat. The result represents an..."
"U.S. and Canadian negotiators are close to a deal on Nafta and there’s optimism it will be reached by the Sunday deadline -- an outcome that would avoid an impasse that imperils $500 billion in annual trade, people familiar with the talks said.
There’s renewed urgency to nail down a new North American Free Trade Agreement that could be published by Sunday so it can be signed by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto before he leaves office, the people said. The U.S. and Mexico reached their own agreement in August,..."
"The Trump administration’s self-imposed deadline to bring Canada into a revised North American Free Trade Agreement is Sunday — and there’s a chance negotiators will miss it.
There was a little optimism late Friday, after Reuters reported that Mexico and the US decided to hold off publishing the text of its United States-Mexico bilateral trade deal on Friday — a signal that both weren’t quite ready to move ahead without Canada.
But the prospects of a last-minute agreement with Canada remain grim after weeks of a negotiating impasse over a..."

“The Biden administration’s weakness caused a surge of illegal immigration. Now they’re forcing taxpayers to buy Kamala Harris’s book to give to those illegal immigrants?”

"President-elect Joe Biden is naming Susan Rice as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, giving her broad sway over his administration’s approach to immigration, health care and racial inequality and elevating the prominence of the position in the West Wing.
The move marks a surprising shift for Rice, a longtime Democratic foreign policy expert who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser and U.N. ambassador. She worked closely with then-Vice President Biden in those roles and was on his short list to become his running mate during..."
"Nervous managers of the scheduled 2020 presidential debates are shuffling the logistics and locations to deal with the threat of the coronavirus. But here’s a better idea: Scrap them altogether. And not for health reasons.
The debates have never made sense as a test for presidential leadership. In fact, one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what we want in a president. When we were serious about the presidency, we wanted intelligence, thoughtfulness, knowledge, empathy and, to be sure, likability. It should also go without saying, dignity...."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s getting late early.
President Donald Trump is privately reassuring Republicans anxious about his deficits to Democrat Joe Biden, noting there are three months until Election Day and reminding them of the late-breaking events that propelled his 2016 comeback.
But four years later, the dynamics are very different.
Aides are increasingly worried that the 2020 campaign may already be defined as a referendum on Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and will feature a historic shift to remote and early vote options. The president’s campaign is scrambling..."
"Gov. Jay Nixon is criticizing the ""over-militarization"" of the police response to protests that have been spurred by the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
Nixon appeared on most of the political talk shows on Sunday, calling the tactics of the St. Louis County Police ""aggressive"" and expressed relief that the Justice Department is conducting its own investigation into the young man's death on August 9.
""There are times when force is necessary, but we really felt that push at that time was a little aggressive,..."
"Above you'll see a picture of Scott Olson, the Getty photographer who's brought us many of the most striking images of protests and police crackdown that followed the shooting of Michael Brown.
The other two men in the photograph, despite presumably being police officers, are not identifiable at this time. Unlike normal police officers, they are not wearing name tags or badges with visible numbers on them. When police arrested the Washington Post's Wesley Lowery and the Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly, they weren't wearing badges or nametags either. Reasonable people..."
"The cold and snow that walloped Washington overnight didn't stop Ashton Carter from reporting for work Tuesday. Carter was sworn in as the 25th U.S. Secretary of Defense after starting his day with meetings at the Pentagon.
Sworn in by Vice President Biden at the White House Tuesday, Carter formally replaces Chuck Hagel, becoming President Obama's fourth defense chief in the past six years.
Carter's debut at the Pentagon this morning was briefly interrupted when his wife, Stephanie, ""slipped and fell on the icy pavement,"" the AP reports. ""She laughed..."
"Covid-19 is here to stay.
It's highly unlikely that the United States, let alone the world, will be able to completely eliminate the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.
But there will come a day when it's no longer a pandemic, when cases are no longer out of control and hospitals aren't at great risk of overflowing with patients. Many experts predict the spread of coronavirus will look and feel more like seasonal influenza.
What's less clear is how and when that will happen.
""There's not even a measurement to say that..."
"Time is running out for congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama to strike a deal to avert the fiscal cliff. If the two parties can't come to an agreement before the end of the year, a combination of broad tax hikes and deep government spending cuts take effect . Experts warn of a new recession if Washington goes over the fiscal cliff."
"As they battle a pandemic that has no regard for borders, the leaders of many of the world’s largest economies are in the thrall of unabashedly nationalist principles, undermining collective efforts to tame the novel coronavirus.
The United States, an unrivaled scientific power, is led by a president who openly scoffs at international cooperation while pursuing a global trade war. India, which produces staggering amounts of drugs, is ruled by a Hindu nationalist who has ratcheted up confrontation with neighbors. China, a dominant source of protective gear and medicines, is..."
"With the midterm elections a month away, ad spending tells the story of what messages the candidates and their backers think will win with voters.
For Democrats, there's been a significant increase in spending on ads related to abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And in many races, Republicans have amped up their ads accusing Democrats of being soft on crime.
According to AdImpact, a firm that tracks ads, Democrats spent more than $73 million on television ads about abortion in September, nationwide. That represents about a third of..."
"The White House and Republican senators sought compromise Tuesday on limiting presidents’ powers to unilaterally declare national emergencies, as chances improved that President Donald Trump might avoid a long-expected rejection by Congress of his effort to divert billions more for building barriers along the Mexican border.
As a Thursday showdown vote in the Senate neared, GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and others were talking with the White House about related legislation that would curb the ability of presidents to declare future emergencies. If Trump..."
"Not limiting their activities to the earthly realm, American and British spies have infiltrated the fantasy worlds of World of Warcraft and Second Life, conducting surveillance and scooping up data in the online games played by millions of people across the globe, according to newly disclosed classified documents."
"NSA and GCHQ collect gamers' chats and deploy real-life agents into World of Warcraft and Second Life. To the National Security Agency analyst writing a briefing to his superiors, the situation was clear: their current surveillance efforts were lacking something. The agency's impressive arsenal of cable taps and sophisticated hacking attacks was not enough. What it really needed was a horde of undercover Orcs."
"Russia's proposal for Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to international control was a ""potentially positive development,"" but could be a stall tactic, President Barack Obama told CNN on Monday.
""We're going to run this to ground,"" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, adding that the United States will work with Syrian ally Russia and the intern"
"President Barack Obama said Monday he would put strikes against Syria on hold if Bashar Assad’s regime were to turn over control of its chemical weapons — though he sounded a skeptical note on the idea that would actually occur.
“Absolutely. If in fact that happens,” Obama said in an interview with ABC, one of six he sat for at the White House on Monday."
"(CNN) - Major League Baseball (MLB) owners have finalized a plan that may allow the 2020 season to start on Fourth of July weekend, according to multiple outlets, including the New York Times and ESPN.
The season, which was set to start on March 26, was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. MLB owners and league management have agreed upon an 82-game regular season, down from the traditional 162 games, according to the reports.
Spring training will begin in early to mid-June, and games would resume in early July..."
"U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush vowed on Monday to shake up Washington's culture if he reaches the White House, calling for stricter controls on government spending and a longer ban on lobbying by former members of Congress.
Bush proposed a federal balanced budget amendment and presidential line-item veto power, as well as a freeze on government hiring."
"Jeb Bush kicked off a series of policy speeches in his old political stomping ground on Monday, rolling out a reform agenda for “Mount Washington,” a spinoff of the nickname he gave Tallahassee during his eight years as governor.
“We used to call this city 'Mount Tallahassee' because it was so remote from the people, caught up in the settled ways of a comfortable establishment,” Bush said to an audience of political supporters.
The former governor, who served from 1999 through 2007, used the"
"It’s time, as they say on Twitter, to #locktheclock. We need to put an end to the century of back-and-forth. After we spring forward this weekend, we should make daylight saving time permanent.
On Sunday, people in most areas of the country will set their clocks ahead one hour, making it so that darkness falls later in the day. (Clocks will revert, or “fall back,” on Nov. 6 — a federally enforced seasonal shift.) But making daylight saving time permanent would, almost certainly, give the people what they want —..."
"Iran launched nearly a dozen cruise missiles and over 20 drones from its territory in the attack on a key Saudi oil facility Saturday, a senior Trump administration official told ABC News Sunday.
It is an extraordinary charge to make, that Iran used missiles and drones to attack its neighbor and rival Saudi Arabia, as the region teeters on the edge of high tensions.
President Donald Trump warned the U.S. was ""locked and loaded"" to respond to the attack on Sunday, waiting for verification of who was responsible and for..."
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Friday that the Justice Department is pursuing about three times as many investigations into leaking as were open at the end of the Obama era, a significant devotion of law enforcement resources to hunt down the sources of unauthorized disclosures that have plagued the Trump administration."
"President Joe Biden on Tuesday ordered 50 million barrels of oil released from America’s strategic reserve to help bring down energy costs, in coordination with other major energy consuming nations, including China, India and the United Kingdom.
The move is aimed at global energy markets, but also at U.S. voters who are coping with higher inflation and rising prices ahead of Thanksgiving and winter holiday travel. Gasoline prices are at about $3.40 a gallon, more than 50% higher than a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.
Administration officials..."
"The United States plans to draw 50 million barrels of oil from its emergency oil reserves in coming months, a widely anticipated step aimed at trying to take the edge off high prices that have been hurting consumers at the pump — and hurting President Biden in the polls.
Price inflation has emerged as a top political concern with voters, who have seen prices for gasoline and other staples surge in recent months. Biden has been talking with other leaders about the problem, and other major consumers — China, India,..."
"President Trump and his top aides can't seem to shake the Russian bear that follows them around.
It put its paw on the scales of the U.S. presidential election last year, according to the U.S. intelligence community. It cost Trump his then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort. And now the connections between Trump's camp and Moscow might mean that another top aide, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, could be sent off to Siberia — metaphorically."
"Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, may be in a lot of trouble.
Late Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that Flynn had called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on December 29, the same day that Obama had slapped new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its hack of the US election. The conversation covered the sanctions,"
"During the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings, Republican House members led by Rep. Devin Nunes repeatedly declared that the real scandal was not President Trump’s attempt to muscle the Ukrainian president but Ukraine’s supposed intervention in the 2016 election to harm Trump. Other Trumpers, including Rudy Giuliani, Fox News hosts, and assorted right-wing partisans and journalists, have passionately decried the Trump-Russia affair as a hoax and insisted that Ukrainian interference was the true wrongdoing. And Trump himself has denied that Vladimir Putin attacked the election, and he has called for..."

"The number of migrant children and families seeking to cross the U.S. southwest border has surged to levels not seen since before the pandemic, a challenge for President Joe Biden as he works to undo the restrictive immigration policies of his predecessor.
Statistics released Wednesday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection showed the number of children and families increased by more than 100% between January and February. Kids crossing by themselves rose 60% to more than 9,400, forcing the government to look for new places to hold them temporarily.

Within a week after gaining the electoral votes needed to win the presidency, Biden announced that adviser and lawyer Ron Klain would be his chief of staff. Klain is the first official to be formally named by Biden.
Biden has since announced a slew of close advisers who will head key parts of his White House operation. He has named former campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon..."
"Joe Biden is filling his White House with longtime aides who served in key roles in his campaign and, in some cases, worked alongside the president-elect during the Obama administration.

"In the days leading up to the Fourth of July weekend, when millions of Americans travel by car, Republicans sought to blame President Biden and congressional Democrats for high gas prices. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, in the midst of a tough reelection fight, blamed $5-a-gallon gas on “the elite Democrats that support President Biden’s environmental policies.” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) accused Biden of “waging a holy war against American fossil fuels.” And Utah Representative Chris Stewart claimed that “President Biden’s energy policy is one of the greatest self-inflicted..."
"The former FBI lawyer and ongoing Trump target breaks two years of silence in this exclusive interview. And she has quite a lot to say.

But recently, I did just that when I sat down with Lisa Page the week before Thanksgiving in my hotel room in Washington, D.C. Page, of course, is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory..."
"Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page has tried to avoid the media spotlight since gaining national attention for her text messages with fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, which President Donald Trump and his allies have used as evidence of a ""deep state"" conspiracy to undermine his presidency.
But in a rare interview, Page, 39, told The Daily Beast that she could no longer silently stomach the president's attacks on her. She said ""the straw that broke the camel’s back"" came when Trump repeatedly called her name at an Oct. 11..."

Probable cases include those that show evidence of an infection without the confirmation of a lab test and cases where coronavirus was listed as a cause or contributing cause of death but are not confirmed with a..."
"President Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit seeking to throw out hundreds of thousands of ballots in Wisconsin, in an effort to overturn the results in a state he lost to President-elect Joe Biden.
Results in the state were certified on Monday, following a partial recount requested and paid for by the Trump campaign that increased Biden’s margin of victory in the state by a handful of votes.
The Trump campaign’s suit, which was filed in the state Supreme Court on Tuesday morning, targets roughly 221,000 ballots cast in two..."

"On late Monday evening, 23-year-old Sana Imitiyaz Hussani was, as usual, wearing a salwar suit (traditional Indian attire) with a white apron bearing a pink label that said “Sweet Temptations by Sana Imitiyaz.” After putting the final touches on cake orders, she pulled out her mobile phone to send a WhatsApp message to the delivery service that would take the treats to her customers. But she couldn’t reach the service.

"Up to 100 people may have had direct or indirect contact with the first person to be diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus in the United States, and four of his relatives have been quarantined in their homes as a precaution, health officials said Thursday.
Dallas County officials said 12 to 18 people had direct contact with the Texas patient, and they in turn had contact with scores of others."
"Texas health officials now say that as many as 100 people in the state are being monitored for possible signs of the Ebola virus. The people being monitored include the 12 to 18 people who first came into contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the patient listed in serious condition at a Dallas hospital. Federal health officials have said the figure includes a handful of schoolchildren and three members of the ambulance crew that took the infected man to the hospital. The larger number includes those initial people who had contact..."
"President Obama jumped back on the campaign trail Sunday after a week of grim Ebola news, with a rally at a high school here aimed at lifting the fortunes of Anthony G. Brown, the state’s lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for governor.
In a jam-packed gymnasium, Mr. Obama urged the mostly African-American crowd of 8,000 to shake off any midterm malaise and show up on Nov. 4 to put Mr. Brown in the governor’s mansion.

In a tweet, the Tesla billionaire linked to a Reuters story from May 2 about a..."
"Elon Musk tweeted early Friday that his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter was temporarily on hold as he examined the number of spam accounts on the site, sending the company’s stock on a steep slide in premarket trading.
“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” he tweeted, linking to a Reuters article from last week citing a Twitter filing.
Roughly two hours later, he added: “Still committed to acquisition.”
It was not immediately clear how the Tesla CEO would..."
The Baltimore Police Department's report on the death of Freddie Gray is now being examined by the city's top prosecutor.

"Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose.
Mr. McConnell’s remarks, confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump’s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day. They came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an..."

"The coal industry already has its legal claws honed for a court battle over President Obama's Clean Energy Plan, which was unveiled Monday, claiming that it will cost too much and render people jobless. Certainly, in the short term at least, slowing climate change by reducing carbon emissions won't be cheap and it won't be easy. But the science shows: We don't have a choice. Decades of denial and delay on global warming have sharpened the need for dramatic action now."
"Facing the threat of lawsuits for defamation, Fox News and the upstart right-wing network Newsmax have begun broadcasting segments walking back wild election fraud allegations against voting-machine and software manufacturers Smartmatic and Dominion.
“Newsmax would like to clarify its news coverage and note that it has not reported as true certain claims made about these companies,” host John Tabacco said Monday, attributing the “opinions and claims” to “various guests, attorneys and elected officials” who appeared on the network. The charges, which the companies say are baseless and have been widely..."

"Two Louisville police officers were shot during demonstrations on Wednesday night, the police chief said, after a grand jury decided to not charge any officer in the killing of Breonna Taylor, instead indicting one former detective for recklessly firing into another apartment during a botched raid on Ms. Taylor’s apartment in March.
A suspect, Larynzo Johnson, 26, was arrested Wednesday and charged with 14 counts of wanton endangerment and two counts of assault on a police officer, according to the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections. The suspect was booked on..."

"Vice President Joe Biden said on Saturday that turning away Syrian refugees was exactly what the self-described Islamic State wanted.
Biden pointed specifically to comments by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in which he said that the group wanted to destroy the ""gray zone"" of coexistence in the West and make it so that Muslims felt they had to flee to the extremist group to escape persecution.
""To turn them away and say there is no way you can ever get here would play right into the terrorists’ hands. We..."

"A federal judge says an Alabama law restricting abortion doctors is unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ruled Monday that state lawmakers exceeded their authority when they passed a law last year requiring doctors at abortion clinics to have hospital admitting privileges.
Thompson issued an order temporarily blocking enforcement of the law.
Thompson's decision comes days after a federal appeals court blocked a similar law in Mississippi."
"On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states?
For more than two centuries, the answer has been “yes.” Both Article 1 of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment require that House seats be allotted according to “the whole number” of persons in each state. That phrase has long been read..."
"By a 241-187 vote, the House of Representatives has approved a bill that would cut off federal money for Planned Parenthood. The bill isn't expected to pass in the Senate — and President Obama has said he would veto any bill that defunds the group.
Last year, Planned Parenthood received around $528 million in government funds that came to it through two federal programs that are aimed at lower-income Americans: Medicaid and Title X. (Our It's All Politics blog recently gave a detailed rundown of the group's funding.)"
"House Republicans vented their rage against Planned Parenthood on Friday, voting to block all federal financing for the organization, which they accused of profiting from the sale of aborted fetuses for medical research. It was unclear, however, if the vote would mollify conservative lawmakers who have threatened to force a government shutdown over the abortion issue.
Neither the Planned Parenthood bill, which passed 241 to 187, nor a second anti-abortion measure approved on Friday has any chance of becoming law because of opposition from Senate Democrats and President Obama. But..."

"The Rev. Fred Robinson was about to start Sunday morning worship with his church staff when he heard a stunning public confession.
It came around the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in January of last year. His church had canceled in-person worship, but staffers had gathered inside the sanctuary to record a live online service.
About 10 minutes before going live, a worship team member arrived and instinctively reached out to hug a man wearing a face mask who was setting up microphones. The masked man, in trying to keep..."
"During the holiest week of the year for Christians, churchgoers across the country are hearing the language associated with Jesus' suffering and death: atonement. This message mirrors one that we are now hearing from Congress around reparations for Black Americans because of the United States' egregious human rights violations against them, from slavery to lynchings to Jim Crow Laws.
There is enough momentum in the House of Representatives to pass H.R. 40, which would establish a commission to study and develop reparations proposals. During Easter—and after this holiday ends—Catholics will continue to push..."
"A US intelligence report found that several researchers at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill in November 2019 and had to be hospitalized, a new detail about the severity of their symptoms that could fuel further debate about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, according to two people briefed on the intelligence.
A State Department fact sheet released by the Trump administration in January said that the researchers had gotten sick in autumn 2019 but did not go as far as to say they had been hospitalized. China reported to the World Health Organization that..."

"The White House is authorizing the National Archives to share a set of documents with the Democratic-led House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday.

"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday criticized American companies and institutions for silencing speech that expresses support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, saying the companies should adhere to American values while doing business with China.
In a wide-ranging speech on the Trump administration’s China policy, Mr. Pence accused the N.B.A. and Nike of checking their “conscience at the door” when it comes to China.

"It was the sort of short-term outlook that has been a centerpiece of President Trump’s approach to the coronavirus.
The long-planned convention in Charlotte would be scaled downward, the Trump campaign announced June 11, in favor of holding a more boisterous speech from the president in the city of Jacksonville. The reason for the change was explicit: Charlotte’s mayor was mandating procedures aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus. Those procedures meant masks and physically separated convention attendees. Trump, who wanted a loud crowd there to cheer him on,..."

Finalized days after the Supreme Court barred sex discrimination against LGBT individuals on the job, the regulation from the federal Department of Health and Human Services was to have taken effect Tuesday.

"Governors took sweeping actions during earlier surges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many closed schools and ordered businesses shut down. They issued mask mandates, vaccine requirements and even quarantines in some places for people who had traveled to out-of-state hot spots.
Not this time, even as the exponential spread of the super-contagious omicron variant shatters COVID-19 infection records. While governors are sending help to hospitals, they are displaying little appetite for widespread public orders or shutdowns.
Even Democratic governors who passed strict mandates early on are now relying more on persuasion than..."

""These nine families have shared a single goal from the very beginning: to do whatever they could to help prevent the next Sandy Hook. It is hard to imagine an outcome that better accomplishes that goal,"" said Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the victims' families, in a statement on Tuesday."
"Remington Arms agreed Tuesday to settle liability claims from the families of five adults and four children killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, according to a new court filing, marking the first time a gun manufacturer has been held liable for a mass shooting in the U.S.
Remington agreed to pay the families $73 million."
"Barack Obama went high.
On the third night of the Democratic convention — a word that seems increasingly absurd to describe what is really just two hours of nightly programming from the DNC — the former president delivered a memorable speech that balanced torching the sitting president with assuring voters of the possibility of something better. All the while, he pulled back the historical view to 30,000 feet where it was possible to show voters the sweep of American history and remind them that the country, despite what he called..."
"From a high-resolution photograph of Donald Trump’s printed-out remarks for his Thursday press conference, we know two things: the first is that Trump’s speech was printed out for him in a huge font and protected by a plastic page protector. The second was that the visible page of the speech was unmarked except in one place: Where the word “Corona” in “Corona Virus” (two words) had been crossed out with a Sharpie and replaced with a word in distinctive penmanship printed in all caps: CHINESE.
It was clear Trump had..."
"In a stunning setback to regulators’ efforts to break up Facebook, a federal judge on Monday threw out antitrust lawsuits brought against the company by the Federal Trade Commission and more than 40 states.
The judge, James E. Boasberg for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said that the case from the states needed to be dismissed because too much time had elapsed since the alleged offenses took place. The states, led by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, accused Facebook in December of buying up nascent competitors like Instagram..."
"Some conservative Supreme Court justices Tuesday signaled that they’re unlikely to tear down Obamacare as oral arguments began in a Republican-backed lawsuit challenging the landmark health care law.
The justices’ line of questioning suggests the court’s newly fortified 6-3 conservative majority has reservations about overturning or undercutting a law that covers over 20 million people and provides popular insurance protections."
"It could be years before we know whether rock stars have the constitutional right to accidentally drop the F-bomb on TV or if a flash of nipple will cost a network millions in fines, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling Thursday that kicks a question about an FCC rule further down the road.
In FCC vs. Fox Television Stations, the court avoided the central question of whether the FCCs indecency rules policing passing profanity or fleeting glimpses of nudity on the air violates the First Amendment.

"The FBI executed a search warrant on Monday at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, the former President confirmed to CNN.
Trump declined to say why the FBI agents were at Mar-a-Lago, but the former President said the raid was unannounced and “they even broke into my safe.”
“My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” he said in a statement."

The arrangement, first reported by conservative outlets, left hidden who ultimately profited from the payments —..."
"Each Feb. 1 marks the beginning of celebration of Black academics, poets, politics, and activists’ contributions to American history. Evolving from Carter G. Woodson’s “Negro History Week,” Black History Month was officially recognized in 1976 to uplift the “too-often neglected accomplishment of Black Americans.” But just as long as there have been efforts to uplift Black history, there have been attempts to discredit and invalidate it as well.
Beginning this year, 14 states have signed provisions into law that restrict teachings of racial justice and Black contributions to American history...."
"Life expectancy in the United States dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as COVID-19 caused its first wave of deaths that disproportionately affected people of colour, according to a new report (PDF) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released on Thursday.
“This is a huge decline,” Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC, told the Associated Press. “You have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this.”"
"At some point during my family’s visit to Disney World, I started to wonder where I was supposed to find all the degeneracy the House of Mouse is accused of peddling. “It’s A Small World” remains a compilation of national stereotypes.

And Americana remains alive and well at Tom Sawyer Island, which is located across the way from the Hall of Presidents and encircled by a moat patrolled by the Liberty Belle paddleboat.

Lives were saved when a member of the volunteer security team at a Texas church fatally shot a gunman who had opened fire on the congregation during a Sunday morning church service. Thanks and praise for his skilled actions are due Jack Wilson. But what must not be forgotten or forgiven is that two innocent people were shot to death in a house of prayer by a man who — despite a troubled and violent past — had access to a gun because of this country’s lax gun laws.
"A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Justice Department to put forward proposed redactions as he committed to making public at least part of the affidavit supporting the search warrant for former President Donald Trump’s estate in Florida.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart gave prosecutors a week to submit a copy of the affidavit with proposed redactions for the information it wants to keep secret after the FBI seized classified and top secret information during a search at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate last week.
The Justice Department also revealed during Thursday’s hearing..."
"The Supreme Court term that began last fall has spanned several epochal upheavals at once: the second peak and wind-down of the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 Presidential election, and its dramatic aftermath, including the violent mob attempt to block the certification of the outcome. During the term, oral arguments were conducted entirely by telephone, a low-tech option that had the effect of keeping the Justices less visually accessible to the public. Amy Coney Barrett took the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat, creating a six-Justice conservative majority that seemed to insure..."
"America’s hard-pressed drivers may be about to receive a holiday. On Wednesday Joe Biden called on Congress to suspend the federal tax on gas and diesel until September as the country struggles with soaraway costs at the pump. But experts warned the tax holiday is unlikely to have a major impact on prices and will probably further harm the US’s already battered roads and bridges. If the tax cut even gets passed.

"President Joe Biden is trying to break a logjam with Republicans on how to pay for infrastructure improvements, proposing a 15% minimum tax on corporations and the possibility of revenues from increased IRS enforcement as a possible compromise.
The offer was made Wednesday to Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia as part of the bipartisan negotiations and did not reflect a change in Biden’s overall vision for funding infrastructure.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden examined possible tax code changes from his plans that Republicans might..."
"President Biden signaled at a private meeting on Wednesday that he would be open to significant revisions on the size of his infrastructure package and how it would be paid for in order to win Republican support, outlining a plan for about $1 trillion in new spending financed through tax changes that do not appear to raise the top corporate rate.
While Biden has not abandoned his call for these tax increases as part of his broader agenda, the moves are still a potential new concession in stalled talks over..."
"The Roman Catholic bishops of the United States on Tuesday elected a Hispanic immigrant as their president for the first time by elevating Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, who has long vowed to defend immigrants amid their fears of deportation.
The bishops followed custom by selecting their previous vice president, but the move is nonetheless a pointed statement from Catholic leaders while President Trump continues to draw support for his anti-immigrant policy. Archbishop Gomez received 176 votes to 18 for the second finisher, Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron of..."
"With New Year's Eve just one day away, health officials are sounding the alarm about large gatherings to ring in 2021. Their warnings come as the famous ball drop in New York's Times Square and many other big celebrations will be virtual this year.

"Texas state senator Wendy Davis defended her campaign's political ad that features an empty wheelchair and attacks Greg Abbott, saying ""the intent was to demonstrate (his) hypocrisy.""
Davis, a Democrat who's running against Abbott for governor this fall, told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio on Saturday that Abbott has unfairly tried to block cases as attorney general that have similarities his own history.
""He rightfully had an opportunity to access the justice system when he was at the receiving end of a tragic accident,"" Davis said. ""But..."
"Joel Benenson, the pollster for Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, is defending a controversial TV ad released by the campaign that has been panned by political pundits and campaign operatives on both sides of the aisle.
“I’m confident that the ad is effective and working and is consistent with the strategy of our ads in this campaign that depicts Greg Abbott as an insider repeatedly siding with insiders and against average Texans,"" Benenson, who served as President Obama's chief pollster in the 2008 and 2012 elections, said in an..."
"The U.S. government won’t issue so-called vaccine passports, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, after Texas sought to limit their development because of privacy concerns.
“The government is not now, nor will we be, supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential,” Psaki told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. “There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.”
The administration wants to protect Americans’ privacy and doesn’t want vaccine passports “used against people unfairly,” Psaki..."

"President Barack Obama announced Thursday that a U.S. counterterrorism operation targeting an al Qaeda compound in January accidentally killed two innocent hostages, including one American.
Multiple U.S. officials told CNN the hostages, Warren Weinstein, an American, and Italian national Giovanni Lo Porto, were killed by a U.S. military drone that targeted the al Qaeda compound.

"There is a “distinct possibility” that Russia will invade Ukraine in a “very swift time frame,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Friday, as he urged all Americans in Ukraine to “leave as soon as possible … in any event, within the next 24 to 48 hours.”
“There will be no opportunity to leave and no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation in the event of a rush invasion,” Sullivan said to reporters in the White House briefing room. An attack, he said, would “likely begin” with aerial bombing..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — E-cigarette giant Juul Labs is facing mounting scrutiny from state law enforcement officials, with the attorneys general in Illinois and the District of Columbia investigating how the company’s blockbuster vaping device became so popular with underage teens, The Associated Press has learned.
The company’s rapid rise to the top of the multi-billion dollar U.S. e-cigarette market has been accompanied by accusations from parents, politicians and public health advocates that Juul fueled a vaping craze among high schoolers. In addition to the ongoing inquiries in Illinois and the..."
"Juul CEO Kevin Burns said Thursday that non-smokers should not use his company’s product. “Don’t vape. Don’t use Juul,” Burns said during an appearance on CBS This Morning. “Don’t start using nicotine if you don't have a preexisting relationship with nicotine. Don’t use the product. You’re not our target consumer.”
The straightforward message comes as the company faces multiple lawsuits, growing concern from the public over the popularity of Juul among teenagers, and an investigation launched by House Democrats earlier this year. Burns has previously apologized to the families of..."
"Donald J. Trump rarely, if ever, acknowledges he might be losing at anything. He expressed bewilderment at a poll during the primary race that showed him behind in the Iowa caucuses. He often invokes unscientific polls as examples of his strength, and mentions surveys that have questionable methodology."
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday demanded that the United Nations hold China accountable for the coronavirus pandemic as he defends his own handling of COVID-19 in America where the death toll has reached 200,000.
“We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy – the China virus – which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries,” Trump said in a prerecorded address to the U.N. General Assembly that lasted less than seven minutes.
“As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague..."
"White House officials said on Monday that President Biden will impose economic sanctions on the two separatist regions of Ukraine that President Vladimir V. Putin recognized as independent, but stopped short of imposing any penalties directly on Russia.
The limited nature of the sanctions appeared intended to allow the United States and its European allies to hold in reserve the more aggressive sanctions they have threatened to impose on Moscow if Mr. Putin sends Russian armed forces into Ukraine, and to allow for the increasingly slim possibility of a diplomatic..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders emerged as the winner in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday, but former mayor Pete Buttigieg trailed closely behind. Sen. Amy Klobuchar finished third.
“Thank you, New Hampshire,” Sanders told supporters. “Let me take this opportunity to thank the people of New Hampshire for a great victory tonight.”
But Sanders' narrow victory leaves the Democratic field unsettled with no clear frontrunner.
The Vermont senator had been heavily favored to win the state where he trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by more than 20 percentage points. In the..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) claimed unchallenged control of the Democratic Party's left wing with a victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary Tuesday as two moderates, Pete Butti­gieg and a newly surging Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), vied for the opposition mantle in a campaign that has been remade over the past eight days.
Sanders and Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., marked their second straight strong showings — they essentially tied in last week's Iowa caucuses, with Sanders carrying the popular vote and Buttigieg winning a slight edge..."
"The Republican Party’s task this week will be to turn Joe Biden into something he’s not and transform President Trump’s failures into successes.
If a political consultants’ Olympics gave marks for degrees of difficulty, this event would set a record. No wonder several Republican senators are taking a pass on the whole thing.
But Democrats are nonetheless wary about what will come their way.
The 2016 Trump Convention was a crude production, lacking in star power and uplift. A lot of big-time Republicans also stayed away. Yet it turned out..."
"Sen. Dianne Feinstein is under fire after video shows her arguing with children who visited her office in hopes of swaying her vote on climate change legislation.
The children were with the Sunrise Movement, a climate advocacy organization, and approached Feinstein in hopes she would support the Green New Deal, an ambitious proposal from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that includes an overhaul of U.S. energy that seeks to stall the effects of climate change.
""I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing,"" the California Democrat..."
"Sen. Ted Cruz believes the US Supreme Court was “clearly wrong” in its landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, the Texas Republican said Saturday.
“Obergefell, like Roe v. Wade, ignored two centuries of our nation’s history,” Cruz said in a clip posted on his YouTube channel for his podcast. “Marriage was always an issue that was left to the states. We saw states before Obergefell, some states were moving to allow gay marriage, other states were moving to allow civil partnerships. There were different standards that the states..."
"European and NATO officials are blaming sabotage for three leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 undersea pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. EU officials did not accuse anyone directly, but the allegation underscored the uncertainty around Europe’s energy standoff with Russia, and how volatile the continent’s energy security is as winter approaches.
Officials detected significant drops in pressure in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on Monday, and then detected another pressure drop on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which were ultimately determined to come..."
"The U.S. recovery from the latest Covid-19 wave is taking hold across the country, with cases dropping or poised to start falling in the vast majority of states.

"President Donald Trump is the victim of double-barrel double standards when it comes to his unsubstantiated allegation that his Manhattan skyscraper was illegally wiretapped by former President Barack Obama, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Monday morning, one from Democrats and another from the media."
"Just hours after being the site of a historic siege, the scene outside of the U.S. Capitol was eerie but quiet. The crowds were gone, and the tear gas had lifted. The only sound on the streets was the occasional siren in the distance. From police cruisers to blacked-out SUVs, nearly every vehicle on the road belonged to one law enforcement agency or another. A few dozen TV anchors filed reports from the Capitol’s southwest side. Over their shoulders, camouflaged government employees of unclear affiliation ambled about, relocating their shields..."
"Federal judge Timothy J. Kelly sided with CNN on Friday, ordering the White House to reinstate chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass.
The ruling was an initial victory for CNN in its lawsuit against President Trump and several top aides.

The Howard County police chief, William J. McMahon, identified the gunman as Darion Marcus Aguilar, 19, of College Park, Md. He is believed to have killed two people at the Zumiez store at the Mall in Columbia before he committed suicide, the police said."
"The gunman who killed two workers Saturday at a Maryland mall was identified Sunday as Darion Marcus Aguilar, Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said.
Aguilar arrived by cab about an hour before the shootings, and his movements at the mall were limited, McMahon said. He added that Aguilar, 19, fired between six and eight shots from a 12-gauge shotgun. That included a self-inflicted fatal shot.
On Saturday, police said the gunman carried ""a large amount of ammunition"" and apparent makeshift explosives. He killed 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and..."
"Using the example set by the life of slain U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, President Obama this morning told delegates to the United Nations that the diplomat's killers will not determine the world's future.

"The Supreme Court on Friday rejected an audacious lawsuit by Texas that had asked the court to throw out the presidential election results in four battleground states captured by President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The court, in a brief unsigned order, said Texas lacked standing to pursue the case, saying it “has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.”
The move, coupled with a one-sentence order on Tuesday turning away a similar request from Pennsylvania Republicans, signaled that the court has..."
"President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Friday to call attention to a break-in at the home of a Baltimore congressman he has been sharply criticizing for days.
Trump was referring to reports in Baltimore media that police are investigating a burglary at Rep. Elijah Cummings’ home in West Baltimore that took place on Saturday.
“Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “Too bad!”
Cummings confirmed the incident in a statement, saying:

"Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday in a ceremony that will keep with tradition while being unlike any other inauguration in U.S. history.
There will be pomp, ceremony, former presidents, congressional leaders, A-list performers, parades and tributes to the troops — but before a small, socially distanced audience in a city that has been locked down because of the dual threats of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 400,000 people in the U.S., and possible domestic terrorism after the..."
"Good morning.
Just as they did during the Republican National Convention, independent fact checkers are watching and listening to what's said at the Democratic National Convention. While they aren't yet slamming the Democrats for fudging their facts, they are finding some claims that don't add up or are misleading, both Tuesday night and again on Wednesday:
— ""When former President Bill Clinton took the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, he portrayed President Barack Obama as a pragmatic compromiser who has been stymied at every turn by Republicans,""..."
"Former U.S. President Bill Clinton highlighted a stunning fact during his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday: Democratic presidents have overseen the creation of nearly twice as many jobs as Republican presidents since 1961.

"The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday will tighten fuel emissions standards for cars and light trucks to 40 miles per gallon by the 2026 model year, replacing the looser Trump-era standards.
The new standards will save consumers money on fuel and prevent billions of tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere.
The EPA said that by 2026, the requirements will be ""the most ambitious greenhouse gas standards ever set for the light-duty vehicle sector in the US."""
"A federal appeals court gave the green light for President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for large private employers to be implemented as it reversed a previous decision that had put it on hold. The final say over the mandate, which affects some 84 million workers across the United States, will likely rest in the hands of the Supreme Court as opponents immediately filed appeals.

The detained couple, sitting alone in separate rooms, made their arraignment appearance by video conference with the judge, their..."
"Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Sunday slammed Senate Republicans’ negotiating posture in infrastructure talks with the White House as “curious” and “perplexing” — warning that “there will be action” on an expansive legislative package despite a potential failure to strike a bipartisan compromise.
“This has got to be done soon. And without putting a specific date on it … the thing is, it’s just a bit perplexing why the Republicans haven’t moved further on critical pieces,” Granholm told CNN’s “State of the Union.”"
"President Obama made fun of himself at the White House Correspondents Association dinner on Saturday, the annual nerd-ball schmooze-fest where Washington's media stars get comfy with a mix of political bigwigs and Hollywood beautiful people to celebrate a year of journalism.

During a news conference at the Arak heavy water reactor facility, Behrouz Kamalvandi said that Iran had increased low enriched uranium production fourfold and would exceed the limit of 300 kilograms by June 27, in the latest blow to the nuclear deal agreed between Tehran and world powers in 2015.

"Washington (CNN)Pete Buttigieg will end his campaign for President on Sunday, multiple aides tell CNN, ending an unlikely campaign that vaulted the once-unknown mayor from South Bend, Indiana, to a top presidential contender.
Buttigieg was scheduled to fly from Selma, Alabama, to Dallas, Texas, but during the flight he informed reporters that he would be flying back to his hometown of South Bend to make an announcement on the future of his campaign.
That announcement, aides said, is that he is ending his run."
"Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced he was ending the presidential campaign in which he made history as the first openly gay man to win delegates in the race for the nomination of a major political party.
His exit comes a day after his disappointing fourth-place finish in South Carolina and two days before Super Tuesday, when he was expected to continue to struggle amid the dominance of Sen. Bernie Sanders and resurgence of former Vice President Joe Biden. Buttigieg's departure from the once-crowded field also comes a..."

"The year 2012 was supposed to herald Hillary Clinton's swan song, a golden departure amid speculation that she might consider another run at the presidency in 2016.
Instead, the outgoing Secretary of State has found herself and her agency at the center of a scathing report about bloody attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
On Wednesday, four State Department officials, including two who oversaw security decisions at the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, were disciplined after a..."
"Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) criticized Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Thursday, suggesting her absence from a congressional testimony due to a stomach virus was really ""a case of Benghazi flu.""

"With less than a week before Election Day, polls released Thursday indicated a narrow edge for President Barack Obama in Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, three states that are being fiercely contested in the final stretch of the campaign.
In Iowa, Obama was at 50% among likely voters, and Romney at 44%, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll. That's slightly tighter than earlier in October, though the result Thursday was just outside the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. A poll released Wednesday indicated..."
"The countdown to Election Day continues, and the pace of polling in the battleground states has increased. But the main findings remain unchanged: Though polls show an essentially tied race between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney nationwide, Obama holds narrow leads in a handful of battleground states that appear poised to decide the election.
With just five days remaining, the most crucial question now may be less about last-minute polling trends and more about whether the polls will prove to be collectively accurate."
"Democrats had a strong election night on Tuesday, leading the race for governor in Kentucky and taking back full control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in nearly a quarter century.
With all precincts reporting in Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear bested Republican Gov. Matt Bevin by 5,198 votes, or 0.36% of all votes cast. While The Associated Press says the race is too close to call, Beshear declared victory. Bevin refused to concede.
If Beshear's margin holds, it's a blow to President Trump, who rallied in the state..."
"Democrats’ claim of victory Tuesday in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, as well as the Democratic takeover of the Virginia state legislature, left Republicans stumbling and increasingly uncertain about their own political fates next year tied to an embattled and unpopular president.
Many allies of President Trump rushed to explain away the poor performance of incumbent Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) as an anomaly, while other GOP veterans expressed alarm about the party’s failure in a state where Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points in 2016 — and where he just..."

Initial returns from mailed-in ballots — about 24% of registered voters — showed voters overwhelmingly supporting the recall of the board president and two other members. However, it was too early to confirm the outcome.
For many parents, the special municipal election is a referendum on how the city’s school board managed the pandemic.
The recall effort stemmed from frustration..."
"San Francisco voters have recalled three school board members who spurred a parental backlash for pursuing the renaming of schools and other progressive policy changes as classrooms remained empty during the coronavirus pandemic.
Initial returns Tuesday night showed that voters overwhelmingly voted “yes” to recall Alison Collins, Gabriela López and Faauuga Moliga, three of the board’s seven members — 79 percent voted to remove Collins, 75 percent to remove Lopez and 73 percent to remove Moliga. The early results were dramatic enough that backers quickly declared victory and Moliga acknowledged his apparent defeat.
The outcome in..."
"President Donald Trump announced he has authorized the declassification of documents related to the FBI’s Russia investigation and the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account, part of his efforts to cast aspersions on his political enemies as he falls further behind in his bid for re-election.
“I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday."
President Biden took an important but limited step Wednesday toward a genuine investigation into the origins of covid-19. He issued an order directing his intelligence agencies to “redouble their efforts” to look into the two competing hypotheses about the source of the pandemic (a random viral spillover in nature or an accident at one of the Chinese labs studying bat coronaviruses in Wuhan). But this represents just one aspect of a growing U.S. government and congressional effort to finally try — as best we can — to get to the bottom of how...
"The Philadelphia Inquirer's executive editor is stepping down after his newspaper ran a headline reading ""Buildings Matter, Too"" that garnered widespread backlash.
June 12 will be the last day for the newspaper’s top editor, Stan Wischnowski, CNN reported, citing a memo shared with the Inquirer’s staff. His replacement has not been announced.
Dozens of journalists for the newspaper called out of work last Thursday, two days after the headline ran in print amid public demonstrations and social unrest following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police..."
"The Philadelphia Inquirer’s top editor is resigning after an uproar over a headline lamenting damage to businesses amid turbulent protests denouncing police brutality against people of color, the paper announced Saturday.
The newspaper said Stan Wischnowski, 58, was stepping down as senior vice president and executive editor.
The Inquirer had apologized for a “horribly wrong” decision to use the headline, “Buildings Matter, Too,” on a column Tuesday about looting and vandalism on the margins of protests of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis at the hands of a white police officer...."
"A few dozen Republicans have joined a bipartisan call to break the impasse between President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner over taxes for the highest- earning Americans. The Republicans signed a letter calling for exploration of “all options on taxes and entitlement programs, a signal that some rank-and-file members are ready to bargain."
"A man clad in body armor and carrying ""tactical weapons"" was arrested Thursday after sparking mass panic at a Walmart in Missouri — less than a week after 22 people were killed in a shooting at an El Paso Walmart.
Dmitriy Andreychenko, 20, was carrying guns loaded with more than 100 rounds of ammunition, KY3 reported. He grabbed a shopping cart upon entering the store and started recording himself on a cellphone while walking the aisles.
Though shots were not fired, chaos ensued, and terrified shoppers reportedly ran out of..."
"The House on Wednesday impeached President Trump for inciting a violent insurrection against the United States government, as 10 members of the president’s party joined Democrats to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors for an unprecedented second time.
Reconvening under the threat of continued violence and the protection of thousands of National Guard troops, the House was determined to hold Mr. Trump to account just one week before he was to leave office. At issue was his role in encouraging a mob that attacked the Capitol one week ago..."
"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis celebrated the Ash Wednesday ritual kicking off the Catholic Church’s Lenten season in traditional fashion, while other Masses in northern Italy were canceled over fears of the new coronavirus.
Francis and a long line of priests, bishops and cardinals processed through Rome’s Aventine hill into the 5th-century Santa Sabina basilica for the late-afternoon Mass. Neither the priests nor the faithful were wearing masks, and they all exchanged a sign of peace toward the end of the liturgy. But Rome has largely been spared Italy’s..."
"For the last month, we’ve been adding one or two polls a day to The Upshot’s Senate forecasting model. Today, we update all 36 races, based on estimates from a YouGov online panel that covers every congressional and governor’s race across the country.
The panel, asked for its preferences in collaboration with CBS and The New York Times, is unusual in its scope: It comprises more than 66,000 people living in states with a Senate race this year. YouGov, a polling firm, also conducted online interviews with roughly half of..."
"Judge Aileen Cannon has appointed Judge Raymond Dearie as the special master to review documents seized during a court-approved search of former President Donald Trump's Florida home in August.
Dearie, 78, a former chief judge of the federal court in the Eastern District of New York, was one of the special master candidates suggested by Trump whom the Justice Department did not object to.
Cannon directed Dearie to issue interim reports and recommendations ""as appropriate"" during the review and set a Nov. 30 deadline to complete his work. The Justice..."
"Hillary Clinton wiped “clean” the private server housing emails from her tenure as secretary of state, the chairman of the House committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi said Friday.
“While it is not clear precisely when Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server, it appears she made the decision after October 28, 2014, when the Department of State for the first time asked the Secretary to return her public record to the Department,” Rep."
"An examination of the server that housed the personal email account that Hillary Rodham Clinton used exclusively when she was secretary of state showed that there are no copies of any emails she sent during her time in office, her lawyer told a congressional committee on Friday.
After her representatives determined which emails were government-related and which were private, a setting on the account was changed to retain only emails sent in the previous 60 days, her lawyer, David Kendall, said. He said the setting was altered after she gave..."
"The politics of medicine, morality and free will have collided in an emotional debate over vaccines and the government’s place in requiring them, posing a challenge for Republicans who find themselves in the familiar but uncomfortable position of reconciling modern science with the skepticism of their core conservative voters."
"Stimulus money could be coming to your account tonight.

"Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Tuesday that badly needed direct Covid-19 relief payments were being paid out as early as Tuesday night, as a measure to increase the payments to $2,000 from $600 is stalled in the Senate.
""@USTreasury has delivered a payment file to the @FederalReserve for Americans’ Economic Impact Payments. These payments may begin to arrive in some accounts by direct deposit as early as tonight and will continue into next week,"" Mnuchin announced in a pair of tweets. ""Paper checks will begin to be mailed tomorrow,"" he added."
"A day after an inconclusive presidential election, Brazil is now bracing for a frantic four-week campaign ahead of a runoff vote that will pit leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva against Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right incumbent president.
Official returns from Sunday's first round showed da Silva, a former two-term president universally known as Lula, with 48.4% compared to 43.2% for Bolsonaro. The remaining votes went to nine other candidates.
Da Silva needed to get more than half of the votes to avoid a head-to-head matchup against Bolsonaro, who proved far stronger..."
"Ibragim Todashev, shot dead early Wednesday by the FBI in Florida, has been connected to a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, according to a source close to investigators.
Additional details weren't immediately available.

"Members of the billionaire Sackler family and their company, Purdue Pharma, have reached a deal with a group of states that had long resisted the company’s bankruptcy plan, opening the way for billions of dollars to begin flowing to addiction treatment programs nationwide, according to a court filing Thursday.
If Judge Robert Drain, who has presided over the bankruptcy proceedings in White Plains, N.Y., approves the agreement, the Sacklers will pay as much as $6 billion to help communities address the damages wrought by the opioid crisis."
"The US economy added 372,000 jobs in June, an unexpected boost in hiring and a signal that the labor market remains robust despite recession fears, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, released Friday.
The unemployment rate held steady at 3.6%, still close to the 52-year low last reached in the months before the pandemic hit.
The June job total, slightly down from May's revised 384,000 jobs added, far outpaced expectations. Economists polled by Refinitiv projected 272,700 jobs would be added in June, amid a period of economic unease and growing..."
"Governors across the country have begun to rescind policies meant to stem the coronavirus’s spread, even as the rapid drop in new infections begins to stall.
In Texas, the nation’s second most populous state, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced that he would lift the state’s mask requirement and restrictions on businesses. Mississippi officials unveiled a similar plan.
Health officials reacted with concern, warning that lifting restrictions too early risked another surge of the virus.
Here are some significant developments:
A bomb went off outside a Dutch coronavirus testing facility just..."
"Stocks tumbled on Wall Street after President Donald Trump said he “hereby ordered” U.S. companies to consider alternatives to doing business in China. He also said he would respond to Beijing’s latest tariff increase later Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank nearly 500 points after the president made the announcements on Twitter.
Trump also said he was “ordering” UPS, Federal Express and Amazon to block any deliveries from China of the powerful opiod drug fentanyl. The stocks of all three companies fell as traders tried to understand what the..."
"Democrats close their midterm election campaign Monday facing the nightmare scenario they always feared – with Republicans staging a gleeful referendum on Joe Biden’s struggling presidency and failure to tame inflation.
Hopes that Democrats could use the Supreme Court’s overturning of the right to an abortion and a flurry of legislative wins to stave off the classic midterm election rout of a party in power are now a memory. Biden faces a dark political environment because of the 40-year-high in the cost of living – and his hopes of a swift rebound next year..."
"US inflation took a breather last month for the first time since August. Prices still increased, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
The Consumer Price Index was up 8.3% in the 12 months ended in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday, slightly higher than economists had predicted. It was a decrease from the 8.5% recorded in March, which had been the highest level in more than 40 years."
"America’s postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, conceded on Friday he had implemented recent changes that led to mail delays at the United States Postal Service (USPS) but said he would not reverse the decision to remove mail equipment ahead of the election.

"Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters Sunday to ""clear out"" of an area near where Rayshard Brooks was killed by police last month after an 8-year-old girl was fatally shot near the site over the weekend.
""You shot and killed a baby,"" she said at a news conference. ""Enough is enough.""
Bottoms said the girl, Secoriea Turner, was shot Saturday night while riding in a car with her mother and a friend after they tried to pull into a parking lot. The site had been barricaded after Brooks was..."
"Millions more Americans can get a COVID-19 booster and choose a different company’s vaccine for that next shot, federal health officials said Thursday.
Certain people who received Pfizer vaccinations months ago already are eligible for a booster and now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says specific Moderna and Johnson & Johnson recipients qualify, too. And in a bigger change, the agency is allowing the flexibility of “mixing and matching” that extra dose regardless of which type people received first.
The Food and Drug Administration had already authorized such..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommended booster shots for many recipients of Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccines on Thursday. As a result, up to 99 million Americans are now eligible for additional doses.
Providers expect to administer the first booster shots for the newly eligible Americans as early as tomorrow. 
""These recommendations are another example of our fundamental commitment to protect as many people as possible from COVID-19. The evidence shows that all three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States are safe – as demonstrated by the..."
"Pfizer-BioNTech asked the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 booster shot for all adults ages 18 and up, a move the company has been angling for over the past several months. 
Pfizer’s request will now be considered by the FDA, which will make a final decision in the coming weeks. It’s unclear whether the agency will ask its independent advisory group, called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, to offer guidance on authorizing the booster. 
Pfizer’s booster shot is currently authorized for certain..."
"When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez takes office next month, representing New York's 14th District, she will be a part of the ""blue wave"" of new Democrats in the House. But the 29-year-old may end up being a part of a different kind of wave, too: a bipartisan effort for members of Congress to pay the interns they employ."
"George W. Bush will not support the re-election of Donald Trump, according to people familiar with his thinking, The New York Times reported Saturday.
The paper said the former president and Texas governor won't vote for Trump's reelection and that his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, ""isn't sure how he'll vote."" The paper spotlights several members of the Republican Party who are dissenting from party lines, though Bush was the only prominent Texas politician mentioned. Freddy Ford, a spokesman for Bush, told The Texas Tribune that Bush would steer..."
"President Donald Trump may be losing the support of members of his own party already, with some GOP officials considering a vote for Joe Biden.
Sooner than expected, growing numbers of big Republican names are debating how transparent to be about their decision not to back his re-election, or may even vote for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
According to The New York Times, Former President George W. Bush and Senator Mitt Romney won't support Trump's re-election, Jeb Bush isn't sure how he'll vote, and Cindy McCain, the..."
"A preliminary autopsy report has convinced the family of Michael Brown that the police officer who shot him should be arrested, a lawyer for the family said Monday.

"Despite international condemnation, Florida’s state Senate has passed the Parental Rights in Education Bill, widely known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill.
After more than six hours of debate, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill on Tuesday (8 March), in a 22 to 17 vote. Two Republican state senators joined Democrats in voting against the bill."
"As he rounds out his first 100 days in office, President Joe Biden’s focus on reining in the coronavirus during the early months of his administration seems to have paid off: He can check off nearly all his campaign promises centered on the pandemic.
Biden has delivered on a number of his biggest campaign pledges focused on climate change and the economy as well. But some issues have proved to be tougher for the administration — including immigration, where Biden is grappling with how to enact promised reforms in the..."
"Before being elected president, Joe Biden promised he could accomplish a lot of things in his first 100 days in office.
We gathered a number of those priorities here, two days after he was declared the winner of the 2020 election.
As we approach the 100-day mark of his presidency, and ahead of his first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Biden has made a lot of progress on COVID-19, and Americans largely approve of the job he's doing handling the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.
It's..."
"If January 6, 2021, was just one infamous day in history, its stain on the American story would still reverberate through generations.
But the US Capitol insurrection was far from a self-contained day of rage. It was both the culmination of the rule of an aberrant, demagogic President and a catalyst for the most enduring onslaught on America's system of elective governance in decades. It legitimized violence as a tool of political expression among millions of citizens and cast the haunting possibility that as horrific as that day was, it may be only..."
"President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have pulled off a midterm election for the record books.
Democrats have retained the Senate – doing no worse than holding steady at 50 seats and potentially gaining one – and look likely to keep any net losses in the House in the single digits.
Midterms are supposed to be the time for the opposition party to shine. That should especially be the case when there is once-in-a-generation inflation and when the vast majority of Americans think the country is on the wrong..."
"California teenagers can snooze a little later this year, thanks to a newly implemented law that says most high schools and middle schools cannot start before 8:30 a.m. and 8 a.m., respectively.
That law—the first in the country to set statewide mandates for school start times—isn’t only big for California students, but also for public-health experts fighting against what the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has called an “epidemic” of teen sleep deprivation. Both the AAP and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have long opposed early-morning class times and advocated for middle and high school..."
"Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped to the highest level in three months, suggesting the labor market’s recovery is faltering amid the surge in Covid-19 cases and widening business restrictions.
Initial jobless claims in regular state programs rose by 23,000 to 885,000 in the week ended Dec. 12, Labor Department data showed Thursday. On an unadjusted basis, the figure fell by about 21,000.
Continuing claims for state programs declined by 273,000 to 5.51 million in the week ended Dec. 5. That figure roughly approximates the number of people..."
"The Trump administration on Monday said it supports a federal judge's ruling that the entire Affordable Care Act should be thrown out, signaling a shift in the Justice Department's position and alarming Democrats who vowed to oppose the move.
""The Department of Justice has determined that the district court's judgment should be affirmed,"" three Justice Department lawyers wrote to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is now considering the case. ""[T]he United States is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgment be reversed."""
"On January 3, the Washington Post’s Amy Gardner broke the news that, in an hourlong recorded phone call, President Donald Trump repeatedly pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to somehow change the results in the state to deliver him a victory.

"Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong spooked Wall Street Monday, as U.S. stocks continued their recent run of volatility, with the Dow dropping triple digits in early trading, tracking the nearly 2% drop overnight in Hong Kong amid concerns over China's move to limit reforms in the Asian financial hub.
Stocks pared those early losses and ended off their lows, however. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down about 42 points, or 0.3%, to 17,071 after being down more than 170 points in early trading.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index..."
"What are the police for? Why are we paying for this?
The death of George Floyd and the egregious, unprovoked acts of police violence at the peaceful protests following his death have raised these urgent questions. Police forces across America need root-to-stem changes—to their internal cultures, training and hiring practices, insurance, and governing regulations. Now a longtime demand from social-justice campaigners has become a rallying cry: Defund the police. This is in one sense a last-resort policy: If cops cannot stop killing people, and black people in particular, society needs..."
"Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig goes on trial Monday, accused of making false statements connected to work he did on behalf of powerful interests in Ukraine.
Craig, a top attorney in Democratic political circles who worked for two Democratic presidents, was indicted in April on two counts of providing false statements to the Justice Department related to his Ukraine work. The judge presiding over the case threw out one of those counts last week, but Craig will still go to trial on the single remaining count."
"(CNN)One of Washington's most well-known and accomplished lawyers, the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department's efforts regarding foreign lobbying.
Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner. According to his charges, he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $4 million from a Ukrainian client for the..."
"Earlier today, below a very evil-looking photo of a very rich Michael Bloomberg, Politico published a list of the top ten political donors of 2014. And much to the glee of conservatives, the two biggest spenders by a mile were hedge fund partner Tom Steyer and ex-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg — both supporters of predominantly liberal causes."
"Top 100 donors give almost as much as 4.75 million small donors combined. The 100 biggest campaign donors gave $323 million in 2014 — almost as much as the $356 million given by the estimated 4.75 million people who gave $200 or less, a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance filings found.
And the balance almost certainly would tip far in favor of the mega-donors were the analysis to include nonprofit groups that spent at least $219 million — and likely much more — but aren’t required to reveal their donors’ identities."
"Former President Donald Trump is suing CNN for defamation and asking for compensatory damages in excess of $75,000 and punitive damages of $475 million, according to a lawsuit filed Monday.
He is claiming that the cable news giant has harmed his reputation with ""false, defamatory, and inflammatory mischaracterizations of him"" and that CNN's conduct ""is intended to interfere with [his] political career.""
In particular, Trump argues that he's entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars in punitive damages because of CNN's use of the term the ""Big Lie"" to describe..."
"Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a telegenic rising star with appeal to conservative and establishment Republicans, told donors in a conference call today that he will run for president, according to news reports.

Rubio says he has always felt the..."
"US District Judge Aileen Cannon on Friday released a detailed inventory from the Mar-a-Lago search that the Justice Department previously filed under seal in court.
The search inventory released showed that classified documents had been mixed in with personal items and other materials in the boxes in which they were stored.
Federal investigators also retrieved more than 11,000 non-classified government documents.
One box containing documents marked with confidential, secret and top secret classification identifications also contained ""99 magazines/newspapers/press articles,"" according to the inventory from last month's search filed in federal court in Florida.

"With Justice Stephen Breyer’s reported retirement opening a seat on the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden has a chance to fulfill a campaign promise to name a Black woman to the Court for the first time.
Only two African Americans, Justices Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, have served on the nation’s highest court, and only one woman of color has been a justice — Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Latina. And Black women aren’t just unrepresented on the Supreme Court, they are also massively underrepresented on the federal bench. And they were even more so..."
"Federal regulators evaluated for the first time on Friday the safety and efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine for children 5 to 11, saying that the benefits of staving off Covid-19 with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine generally outweighed the risks of the most worrisome possible side effects in that age group.
The analysis came on the same day that the Food and Drug Administration posted data from Pfizer showing that the vaccine had a 90.7 percent efficacy rate in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in a clinical trial of 5- to 11-year-olds.
The findings..."
"Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of two GOP members of the House select committee investigating January 6, told the Wall Street Journal that the panel is considering asking former President Donald Trump to testify and may request a written interview with former Vice President Mike Pence or issue a subpoena for him to testify.
The committee has long considered interviewing the former vice president as part of its investigation into January 6, 2021. In April, the committee’s chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, told reporters that Pence’s testimony might not be necessary given the..."
"About 1,500 American citizens remain in Afghanistan, and about a third of them are in contact with the U.S. government and hope to leave in the coming days, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday.
Some of the remaining 1,000 may not want to leave, Mr. Blinken said, describing an ever-changing estimate that the Biden administration has grappled to pin down as American troops wind down an evacuation effort that has overwhelmed the airport in Kabul, the capital."
"By any measure, the nearly-six-year tenure of Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. has been one of the most consequential in United States history. His decision to resign, which he announced on Thursday, was long anticipated; he has said he will stay on through his successor’s confirmation. It is hard to imagine that anyone who could make it through the current Senate would have an impact comparable to Mr. Holder’s."
"President Barack Obama pushed back against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Democratic critics of his trade agenda on Friday, accusing them of spreading ""misinformation that stirs up the base but ultimately doesn't serve them.""
Obama surprised reporters by appearing on a conference call with Labor Secretary Thomas Perez in effort to rebut criticisms from Warren and other key Democrats, who worry that his pending Trans-Pacific Partnership deal will exacerbate income inequality and undermine key regulations.

"The Senate approved a historic rules change on Thursday by eliminating the use of the filibuster on all presidential nominees except those to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Invoking the long-threatened “nuclear option” means that most of President Barack Obama’s judicial and executive branch nominees no longer need to clear a 60-vote threshold to reach the Senate floor and get an up-or-down vot

The change is the most fundamental shift in the way the Senate functions in more than a generation."
"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said House Democrats will “likely” subpoena President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton and continue with more investigations after today's historic impeachment vote.
“I think it’s likely yes,” he told CNN of issuing a Bolton subpoena.
Asked what they will look at, Nadler said, “We are talking about everything,” referring to continuing all the probes that have been launched since last year."
"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., says the House expects to continue its investigations into President Trump's conduct, even after Wednesday's expected acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.

"Two devastating explosions struck Saturday morning in the heart of Ankara, the Turkish capital, killing more than 80 people who had gathered for a peace rally and heightening tensions just three weeks before snap parliamentary elections.
At least 86 people were killed and 186 were wounded, said the health minister, Mehmet Muezzinoglu.
The blasts, which appeared to be the deadliest terrorist attack in modern Turkey’s history, occurred near Ankara’s main train station just as groups of Kurds and leftists planned to march to protest the recent resumption of armed conflict..."

Davutoglu called for three days of mourning in a country still reeling from the carnage. The two bomb blasts, about 50 yards apart, went off at the main train station as thousands poured in to attend a rally that included, among others, labor unions and the pro-Kurdish HDP, or..."
"He didn’t invoke a centuries-old law to give him that authority. But he might later.

"Overcoming reservations from the left, the right and the American public, a Senate committee Wednesday passed a resolution to bomb Syria in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons.
In a delayed markup of a resolution to authorize the use of military force, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10 to 7, with one present, to let President Barack Obama mount a bombing campaign aimed at the Syrian regime's weapons of mass destruction for up to 90 days, albeit within a more limited scope than Obama had..."
"While California remains gripped by drought, the scale of lost agricultural jobs and lowered revenue is emerging. And the numbers don't look good. Vast tracts of farmland — mostly in the Central Valley — have been fallowed, which means idled to accumulate moisture. An estimated 564,000 acres will be idled this year, according to an economic update on the drought from researchers at the University of California at Davis."
"The U.S., European Union and Group of Seven nations are enacting new sanctions on Russia in response to the civilian toll reported in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine in recent days.
The U.S. sanctions target Russia's largest banks, families of top Russian officials including Russian President Vladimir Putin's adult children, state-owned entities and any new investment in Russia by U.S. nationals.
""We will document and share information on these atrocities and use all appropriate mechanisms to hold accountable those responsible,"" the White House said in a statement announcing the new measures."
"The Biden administration is preparing to lift Title 42, the public health authority the U.S. has used since the spring of 2020 to stop the spread of Covid by preventing immigrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to claim asylum, say two officials familiar with the planning.
The policy, which the officials say will be lifted on May 23, has blocked more than 1.7 million attempts by immigrants to cross the border since its start during the Trump administration in March 2020, often turning them around and sending them back into poor conditions in..."
"Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in what it called a “full-scale war” that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout already reverberated around the globe.
In announcing a major military operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin deflected global condemnation and cascading new sanctions — and chillingly referred to his country’s nuclear arsenal as he threatened any foreign country attempting to..."
"Russian forces invaded Ukraine from three sides, while explosions rang through a number of cities, including the capital Kyiv, in a broad attack that began before dawn on Thursday.
Here's how it unfolded.
Russian President Vladimir Putin made a speech early Thursday morning, saying he had decided ""to conduct a special military operation ... to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years,"" repeating a baseless claim about Ukraine's Russian-separatist-backed Donbas region.
He denied, however, that Russia was planning to occupy Ukrainian..."
"The UK prime minister remains in intensive care. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is running the UK government while Boris Johnson receives treatment in hospital for coronavirus, says he is confident the prime minister will recover.
Official global death toll passes 78,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 78,269 people have now died worldwide, while at least 1,381,014 have been infected. Due to suspected under-reporting, these figures are likely to be lower than the true statistics.
More than 55,000 have now tested positive in the UK...."
"The House of Representatives voted Tuesday to once again make John Boehner its speaker, handing the Ohio Republican the gavel for the third time despite a late challenge by dissatisfied members of his own party. Tuesday's vote saw the most votes against a sitting speaker since 1923.
Boehner received the votes of 216 House members, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) received 164 votes. A number of discontented Republicans, however, voted for other candidates, including Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), who, with 12 votes, got the most opposition votes from..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that the U.S. and its allies have ignored Russia’s top security demands but added that Moscow remains open to more talks with the West on easing soaring tensions over Ukraine.
Putin argued that it’s possible to negotiate an end to the standoff if interests of all parties, including Russia’s security concerns, are taken into account.
“I hope that we will eventually find a solution, although we realize that it’s not going to be easy,” Putin said.
He deplored the Western refusal to consider the..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin said his government was studying the responses from the United States and NATO to Russia's security concerns, but said his country's main complaints ""had been ignored.""
For weeks Putin had remained tight-lipped about a possible invasion of Ukraine, making scant public remarks about the crisis and the buildup of tens of thousands of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border.
But speaking at a Tuesday news conference following a five-hour meeting in Moscow with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the Russian President said: ""It is already clear..."
"Twitter is expanding its use of warning labels on tweets that contain misleading details about coronavirus vaccines.
The move, announced in a blogpost on Monday, is designed to strengthen the social network’s existing Covid-19 guidance, which has led to the removal of more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5m accounts worldwide.
In December the platform started providing more labels providing additional context to tweets with disputed information about the pandemic. Now the company is increasing its focus on posts about vaccines specifically, and starting a strike system that “determines when..."
"The House gave final passage Wednesday to a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package that will deliver $1,400 stimulus checks to millions of Americans, extend enhanced unemployment benefits and boost funding to ramp up vaccine distribution and reopen schools.
The vote of 220 to 211 sends the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature, securing him his first legislative victory since taking office less than two months ago.
Biden will sign the bill on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said."
"The coronavirus pandemic dealt another crushing blow to retailers in April. Now the question is what the sector will look like as the economy reopens — and how much permanent damage has been inflicted.
Retail sales fell 16.4 percent last month, the Commerce Department said Friday, by far the largest monthly drop on record. That followed an 8.3 percent drop in March, the previous record. Total sales for April, which include retail purchases in stores and online as well as money spent at bars and restaurants, were the lowest since..."
"As fierce fighting continued across Ukraine on Monday, Kyiv said it would push for a cease-fire at talks with officials from Moscow.
The meeting on the Belarusian border comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear deterrent force to be on high alert, a huge escalation in Russia's confrontation with Western powers who have increased their supply of lethal aid to Ukraine and imposed crippling financial sanctions on Moscow.
The United States announced Monday morning it would ban all American businesses from dealing with Russia's central banks, as well as..."
"With Father's Day looming, I am thinking of greeting cards. No, not the card I need to send my father, but the cards he sent to me every single day when I went away. At camp or visiting relatives, and even into college, I could count on that daily envelope from home: a card carefully selected for the sort of jokes that might appeal to a 9-year-old, and a handwritten note from him."
"A filibuster of major gun legislation by a vocal band of conservative Republican senators may have misfired, as a growing number of their GOP colleagues appear ready to help break it when it comes up for a vote on Thursday.
The public split is a rarity for Senate Republicans, who over the past few years have kept divisions to a minimum."
The Senate on Thursday ended a GOP filibuster on a new gun control bill clearing the way for debate to begin on a hugely emotional issue that has dominated headlines since the tragic December shooting in Newtown Conn. The vote was 68-31. Itrsquos a big win for Democrats in that 16 Republicans crossed the aisle to even consider the gun legislation...
"After two days of intense criticism, Joseph R. Biden Jr. reversed himself Thursday night on one of the issues most important to Democratic voters, saying he no longer supports a measure that bans federal funding for most abortions.
As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Biden’s campaign had said he supported the measure, known as the Hyde Amendment. His decision to change positions illustrates the intense pressure he faces as the presumed front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president.
His turnaround was abrupt, particularly because Mr. Biden has grappled for decades with..."
"A federal appeals court Thursday granted former President Donald Trump's request to temporarily block the National Archives from turning over his White House records to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
The committee had been set to receive the first batch of documents, which lawmakers say is key to their investigation, on Friday. In papers filed Thursday, lawyers for Trump asked the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to temporarily delay the turnover and to ""maintain the status quo"" while they push..."
"The Justice Department on Monday rebuffed efforts to make public the affidavit supporting the search warrant for former President Donald Trump’s estate in Florida, saying the investigation “implicates highly classified material” and the document contains sensitive information about witnesses.
The government’s opposition came in response to court filings by several news organizations, including The Associated Press, seeking to unseal the underlying affidavit the Justice Department submitted when it asked for the warrant to search Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month.
Trump, in a Truth Social post early Tuesday, called for..."
"President Trump said on Monday that the White House is planning on asking Congress to pass a payroll tax cut and relief for hourly wage earners in order to assist workers who may be feeling the financial pinch amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Trump said that top administration officials will be meeting with Republican members of the House and Senate on Tuesday to discuss the possible payroll tax cuts and help for hourly workers.
""Very substantial relief that's a big number,"" Trump said. ""We're also going to be talking about hourly..."
"President Trump spoke after a trip where he spent time with two congressmen who were exposed to a person infected with the virus. His new chief of staff has also quarantined himself.
President Trump moved on Monday to address the economic effects of the widening coronavirus crisis by announcing that he would work with Congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade.
The president, who played down the virus threat earlier in the day, made an unscheduled evening appearance in..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against the challengers opposed to partisan gerrymandering, the practice in which the party that controls the state legislature draws voting maps to help elect its candidates.
The vote in two cases was 5 to 4, with the court’s more conservative members in the majority. The court appeared to close the door on such claims.
The drafters of the Constitution, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority, understood that politics would play a role in drawing election districts when they gave the..."
"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was planning to visit Libya in 2012, but those plans were upended when terrorists attacked the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi on Sept. 11 and 12 of that year, according to newly revealed testimony given to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is set to release its highly anticipated report Tuesday."
"President Biden had planned to announce proposals on crime and policing Thursday, an effort to show he is confronting violent crime while responding to Democrats’ desire for action following recent mass shootings and the failure of police reform efforts in Congress.
Biden tested positive for covid-19 on Thursday morning, and the White House did not initially say if he still planned to share his proposals virtually from isolation.
Biden had been scheduled to visit Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to lay out a “Safer America Plan” that included expanded law enforcement funding to..."
"Conservative talk radio and online show personalities are going all in on the smear by Republicans and others in right-wing media that LGBTQ Americans and others who oppose Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” law are “grooming” children to be gay or trans, or promoting sexual activity.
The Tampa Bay Times reported that House Bill 1557, which DeSantis signed into law on March 28, “prohibits instruction related to gender identity or sexual orientation in kindergarten through third grade and potentially restricts such instruction for older kids.” It allows parents to sue..."
"A little over 240 years ago, two of my ancestors put on the uniform of George Washington’s Continental Army and marched into battle, willing to die if it meant bringing their fledgling nation inches closer to independence. Centuries later, in 1992, I followed in their footsteps and joined the Army.
Even knowing how my tour in Iraq would turn out, even knowing that I’d lose both my legs in a battlefield just north of Baghdad in late 2004, I would do it all over again. Because if there’s anything that..."
"Yes, Hillary Clinton is running for president, and she is running away from President Barack Obama's record on foreign policy.
That's a very clear message from the interview just published in The Atlantic in which she drew sharp distinctions between her view of America's role in the world and those of the President, while also expressing significant disagreements with him over the right approach to ongoing crises in the Middle East."
"Former Secretary of State and all-but-announced presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered her most public break yet from President Obama over the weekend, slamming his ""do not do stupid [stuff]"" foreign policy and suggesting he had not been aggressive enough in asserting America's role in the world.
""Great Nations Need organizing Principles - and 'Do not do Stupid Stuff' IS not an organizing principle,"" Clinton told the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg in a line That Launched a Thousand Surely grimaces (or Worse) in the White House."
"The Biden administration announced new penalties on Russia on Tuesday in response to the poisoning and jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, in President Joe Biden’s first major step in holding Moscow accountable for human rights abuses.
The U.S. intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that Navalny was poisoned last year with a banned nerve agent called Novichok by the Russian security services, the administration revealed on Tuesday. Navalny received treatment for the poisoning in Germany and was arrested upon his return to Russia in January."
"“Yes, @NYGovCuomo sexually harassed me for years. Many saw it, and watched.”
So said Lindsey Boylan, a candidate for Manhattan borough president and former adviser to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a tweet thread Sunday morning.
Boylan, who appears to have worked for the governor’s office from 2015 to 2018, provided few specifics in the thread and stated that she has “no interest in talking to journalists” (Boylan also has not responded to Vox’s request for comment). But she did say, “I could never anticipate what to expect: would..."
"President Barack Obama asked Congress on Wednesday to formally authorize the use of military force in the war against ISIS, the first time a U.S. President has asked for such approval in 13 years.
Lawmakers on Wednesday morning received a draft Authorization for the Use of Military Force, a resolution that would formally authorize a six-month U.S. military effort against the militant group. Shortly after the request was sent to the Hill, the White House announced Obama would speak to the public on the issue Wednesday afternoon.
The joint resolution..."
"President Obama on Wednesday formally asked Congress to authorize a three-year military campaign against the terrorist group the Islamic State that would avoid a large-scale invasion and occupation but in addition to air power could include limited ground operations by American forces to hunt down enemy leaders or rescue American personnel.
A proposal sent by the White House to Capitol Hill on Wednesday would formally give the president the power to continue the airstrikes he has been conducting since last fall against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or..."
"Two years of tax returns are now available for inspection for both GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and running mate Paul Ryan (although Romney's 2011 return is still preliminary), as well as a full 12 years for both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Here's a side-by-side look at 2010 and 2011 returns for the candidates."
"San Francisco voters fired their headline-grabbing reformist district attorney Tuesday, NBC News projects, after rising crime rates proved intolerable even for the famously progressive city.
Chesa Boudin, the son of left-wing radicals who was elected on a Black Lives Matter-aligned platform to reform the criminal justice system, faced a successful recall effort as voters grew frustrated with the perception that his office is not willing to do much about crime.
The outcome and its lopsided margin was a rebuke of the left as Democrats retreat from calls to “defund the police” in the..."
"Congressional leaders have reached an agreement on sweeping sanctions legislation to punish Russia for its election meddling and aggression toward its neighbors, they said Saturday, defying the White House’s argument that President Trump needs flexibility to adjust the sanctions to fit his diplomatic initiatives with Moscow."
"A federal judge in Hawaii issued a worldwide restraining order against enforcement of key parts of President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban executive order just hours before the directive was set to kick in, backed up by a second federal judge in Maryland who put out his own ruling blocking parts of the order."
"You're probably anxious about the results, but patience may truly be a virtue on election night.
Followers of NPR's elections coverage should have read or heard this at least a few times by now: We may not know who wins the presidential election (or any number of other down-ballot races) on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and that's OK.
State results are not final on election night; instead, organizations like The Associated Press — which NPR relies on for race calls — determine most winners well before local officials tabulate..."
"This year, the rise of mail voting will make election night much harder to follow. In most states, the results will be heavily skewed at various points of the night, depending on when a state counts mail ballots, in-person early voting or Election Day voting. In other words, the results could be very misleading. And in some states, the count might take days.
More than anything else, keep these three tips in mind:
Be cautious. A lot of states are changing the way they’re administering the election, and even the..."
"The New York Times admitted Friday that it could not verify the claims of a Canadian man whose account of committing atrocities for the Islamic State in Syria was a central part of its 2018 podcast “Caliphate.”
The series had won a Peabody Award, the first ever for a podcast produced by the newspaper, and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist.
With a major hole blown in the narrative, the Times affixed an audio correction to the beginning of each part of the 12-part podcast and published an investigation into what..."
"The New York Times on Friday released the findings of its internal investigation into star reporter Rukmini Callimachi’s reporting on ISIS and extremism in the Middle East. The newspaper acknowledged that its Caliphate podcast gave “too much credence to the false or exaggerated accounts” of one of its main subjects, Shehroze Chaudhry, who has since been charged in Canada with concocting a terrorist hoax.
The paper of record rolled out its executive editor, Dean Baquet, on Friday to explain the glaring errors in another podcast, this time a “special episode”..."
"With the flick of pen, a new president can undo years of work by a previous administration through his constitutional ""executive powers.""
Since relocating to the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump has signed a number of executive actions, including executive orders and presidential memoranda, aimed both at fulfilling his campaign promises and at rolling back the policies"
"n his first week in office, Donald Trump has begun to inflict immense damage across a wide range of policy areas. He is starting to build the wall, ban refugees, and bar Muslim immigrants. He has cut billions of dollars in funding from U.N. agencies and green-lighted the Keystone XL pipeline. He has placed a freeze on government hiring and prohibited international NGOs that receive U.S. funding from doing so much as uttering the word abortion."
"The filibuster is in peril.
With Republicans expected to change the Senate rules to slash debate time on President Donald Trump’s nominees this week, it will mark the third time the “nuclear option” — changing Senate rules by a simple majority — has been triggered in just six years.
Each of those unilateral moves by a Senate majority to weaken the Senate’s age-old precedents centered on nominations, leaving the legislative filibuster and its 60-vote threshold unscathed. But some senators say it’s just a matter of time before even that Senate..."

Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett and Justice Timothy Victor Holroyde. Crown Prosecutors James Lewis, Clair Dobbin and Joel Smith. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser. Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia Gordon Kromberg. William Burns, the director of the CIA. Ken McCallum, the director general of the U.K. Security Service, or MI5.
Let us acknowledge that the goal of these executioners, who discussed kidnapping and assassinating..."
"Sunday night's public proclamation that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and ohio Gov. John Kasich had reached a truce aimed at ceding states to one another was not predicted but also entirely predictable. With his failure to gain any delegates in New York, Cruz is no longer able to win enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination — a position in which Kasich has found himself for weeks. So the only viable path to the nomination for each is a contested convention — which necessitates that Donald Trump not win..."
"Republican senators overwhelmingly know, whether they admit it publicly or not, that President Donald Trump is guilty of the charges against him, Rep. Adam Schiff argued in his closing remarks to finish the third day of the Senate’s impeachment trial.
But does the president really need to be removed? After all, the 2020 election is around the corner.
In what’s being hailed as a defining moment of this historic trial, the lead House prosecutor went on to outline the damning case for why yes, Trump should be removed, as his..."
"Because of a rise in its Latino population, Gwinnett County in suburban Atlanta had to mail out absentee ballots with information in both English and Spanish in 2018. The result was chaos. The county accommodated the increased text by printing it in 6.5-point font, making each letter smaller than a sesame seed. Many voters were confused by the instructions — in particular, that they had to sign the back of the yellow envelope before returning it or their votes wouldn’t count. Gwinnett rejected 595 absentee ballots, a third of all..."
"President Trump and a growing number of Republican leaders are aggressively challenging efforts to make voting easier as the coronavirus pandemic disrupts elections, accusing Democrats of opening the door to fraud — and, in some cases, admitting fears that expanded voting access could politically devastate the GOP.
Around the country, election officials trying to ensure ballot access and protect public health in upcoming contests face an increasingly coordinated backlash from the right. Much of the onslaught of litigation has been funded by the Republican National Committee, which has sought to..."
"On Sunday morning, Taliban fighters captured Afghanistan's Bagram Airfield — the symbol and source of U.S. power projection in the region for 20 years — releasing thousands of prisoners. Within hours, Taliban fighters were trickling into the city center with little resistance. The Taliban had already swept in and captured the capital city of Kabul. By nightfall, President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, and the Taliban's reconquest of Afghanistan was complete.
Last Monday in Doha, Qatar — the site of fruitless peace talks with the Taliban across now two administrations — the..."
"The vast majority of the thousands of Black Lives Matter protests this summer have been peaceful, with more than 93% involving no serious harm to people or damage to property, according to a new report tracking political violence in the United States.
But the US government has taken a “heavy-handed approach” to the demonstrations, with authorities using force “more often than not” when they are present, the report found.
And there has been a troubling trend of violence and armed intimidation by individual actors, including dozens of car-ramming attacks targeting..."
"A federal judge in Washington blocked a nationwide eviction moratorium the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established as the Covid-19 lockdowns put millions of renters out of work during the past year.
In a ruling on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich said the agency exceeded its authority by issuing a broad moratorium on evictions across all rental properties. “The CDC order must be set aside,” the judge wrote in a 20-page opinion."
"A Supreme Court ruling due in a few weeks could wipe out health insurance for millions of people covered by President Barack Obama's health care law. But it's Republicans — not White House officials — who have been talking about damage control.
A likely reason: Twenty-six of the 34 states that would be most affected by the ruling have Republican governors, and 22 of the 24 GOP Senate seats up in 2016 are in those states.
Obama's law offers subsidized private insurance to people without access to it on the..."
"A senior Pentagon policy official was asked to resign after losing the support of top national-security leadership, CNN first reported on Wednesday morning.
John Rood, the undersecretary of defense for policy since 2018, will step down at the end of this month, the Pentagon said in a statement, confirming the earlier reporting.
Administration officials told Bloomberg that senior national-security officials had lost confidence in Rood's ability to execute President Donald Trump's agenda. Sources told Foreign Policy that he was asked to resign after Trump lost confidence in him following a..."
"The Pentagon’s top policy official, who warned against the Trump administration’s effort to block Ukraine’s military aid last year, is stepping down from his post at the end of the month, Department of Defense press secretary Alyssa Farah said in a statement. The Pentagon’s statement did not explain why John Rood, undersecretary of defense for policy, is leaving. CNN reports he was asked to resign after losing the support of national-security leaders. Farah said James Anderson, the current senior official performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary of defense for..."
"(CNN) - At 10:06 p.m. EST on Monday, the lives of thousands of existing and would-be immigrants to the United States were suddenly thrown into further disarray in the midst of a global crisis. At that time, President Donald Trump tweeted that in order to ""protect the jobs of GREAT American citizens,"" he would be suspending immigration to the United States. On Tuesday evening, he provided further details, saying he would order a 60-day pause that would apply only to people seeking green cards to become permanent US residents. It..."
"Washington (CNN) - It's happening again.
America is blundering into a new Russia election-meddling hall of mirrors that's already doing Moscow's work: tearing fresh political divides and threatening to again tarnish democracy's most sacred moment, a national election.
Revelations Thursday about intelligence assessments that Russia has launched a new interference effort to help reelect Donald Trump -- and the President's furious reaction -- mark the return of a recurring nightmare for the country just nine months before the presidential election."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign to help President Donald Trump get reelected, according to three officials familiar with the closed-door briefing.
Trump pushed back Friday accusing Democrats of launching a disinformation campaign.
“Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!” Trump tweeted."

This analysis found it “highly probable” that the intrusion into the phone was triggered by..."
"President Obama said he was weighing providing lethal weapons to Ukraine to help Kiev defend against Russia’s aggression if diplomatic efforts fail to defuse the tensions there, even as he said the United States remained united with Europe in maintaining sanctions against Moscow.
“The prospect for a military solution to this problem has always been low,” Mr. Obama said, given the extraordinarily powerful military that is at the disposal of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and the length of Russia’s border with Ukraine.
Nevertheless, at a joint news conference..."
"Angela Merkel, the German chancellor desperately working to reach a diplomatic accord ending unrest in eastern Ukraine, continued her efforts at the White House Monday, urging President Barack Obama to forestall sending lethal aid to Kiev.
Her efforts appeared effective; at a midday press conference, Obama said he hadn't yet decided whether or not to send arms and equipment to besieged Ukrainian troops in the eastern part of the country.
But both leaders hinted there could be disagreements to come on how to best end the unrest that has waged..."
"Well, we're finally here: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tonight square off in their first presidential debate at Hofstra University, making it arguably the most consequential night so far of the 2016 election. The stakes are enormous, with recent polls showing the national race ranges from a six-point lead for Clinton (in the NBC/WSJ) to a dead-even tie (in Bloomberg's). There are five storylines we're watching heading into the debate."

"President Joe Biden warned Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would face ""consequences"" after OPEC+ last week announced the biggest cut in oil production since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
Senior Democrats on Capitol Hill have condemned the decision by Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil-producing alliance, to reduce the global supply of petroleum. Higher oil prices are seen as helping Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, finance its war in Ukraine.

"SWEDEN’S PROSECUTION AUTHORITY reopened an investigation of Julian Assange for rape on Monday and will seek his extradition from Britain, the country’s deputy director of public prosecution, Eva-Marie Persson, told reporters in Stockholm.
The Swedish request will force British authorities to decide whether to send the detained WikiLeaks founder to Sweden or the United States, or neither, at the end of his 50-week jail sentence. He is currently serving for violating bail conditions in 2012, when he took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy after losing his final appeal against extradition..."
"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Swedish prosecutors said Monday they are reopening a rape case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and will seek his extradition from Britain.
The move sets up a legal battle with the United States, where the Australian computer hacker is separately wanted for allegedly hacking into a Pentagon computer. British authorities will have to decide which extradition request takes precedence.
Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden for questioning, was evicted last month after Ecuador revoked his..."
"This week, President Biden signed into law the ""Juneteenth National Independence Day.""
It is honoring the work of Black Americans, including people such as 94-year-old Civil Rights Activist Opal Lee, who had long advocated for the celebration that started in Galveston to be made a federal holiday.
Juneteenth celebrates the date when Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19th, 1865, bringing news that the Emancipation Proclamation had freed the enslaved population living in the Confederacy, albeit two years prior.
Yet the reaction amongst many African Americans, myself included, has been muted...."
"On Thursday, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill to recognize Juneteenth as a federal holiday. Juneteenth, which Black Americans have been celebrating since 1866, commemorates the end of legalized slavery in Texas on June 19, 1865, and grew into a broader celebration honored by Black communities throughout the country.
Over the past year, public interest in Juneteenth has significantly grown and many large companies have begun to provide employees with a paid day off (or reduced workload) to coincide with the holiday.
In a statement from JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, the company’s..."

UK defense chief Ben Wallace had suggested that Putin may use this historic day to escalate his so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and declare an outright war. Even if that had been Putin's plan, he was unlikely to follow through after Wallace's comments, not wanting to appear..."
"Bill Clinton on Tuesday addressed a Democratic Party that remains divided over not only his wife’s candidacy but his own legacy as president. During a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention, the former president sought to humanize his wife by describing her as a loving mother and wife whose service to others started long before she walked the halls of power in Washington."
"Taking on the role of devoted political spouse, former President Bill Clinton declared his wife Hillary Clinton an impassioned “change-maker,” serving as character witness for her on the night she triumphantly became the first woman nominated for president.
“She’s been worth every single year she’s put into making people’s lives better,” he said of his partner of more than 40 years and the Democratic Party’s new standard-bearer in the race for the White House."
"President Trump said Friday that the United States did not pay any money to North Korea, which had issued a $2 million bill for the hospice care of American Otto Warmbier, the comatose University of Virginia student sent home from Pyongyang in 2017.
“No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else,” Trump said in a morning tweet in which he suggested he has taken a different approach to hostage negotiations than his predecessor.
Trump reiterated the point two hours later as..."
"The candidates who survived Tuesday’s primary elections — and won’t face runoff elections in May — now start all over again, raising money, researching their opponents and trying to build up the organizations and support that will get them through the November general election.
The race at the top of the ticket was all but a foregone conclusion, with well-known and well-financed candidates on both the Republican side, in Gov. Greg Abbott, and the Democratic side, in Beto O’Rourke.
Abbott and O’Rourke have had their eyes on November from the start,..."
"If Americans aren't sure whether Congress can head off a shutdown of the government in the next three days, they're not alone. The Republican-led House of Representatives didn't know whether it was possible either, as of Friday evening.
The Senate has passed a bill that keeps federal employees on the job until Nov. 15 -- but strips the House GOP's attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act. It's now the lower chamber's turn to deal with the legislation."
"With a possible government shutdown looming, House Republicans gathered Saturday to try to work out a spending plan acceptable to tea party conservatives who demand that it must hurt Obamacare in some fashion.
Speaker John Boehner convened the rare weekend caucus meeting to forge a counteroffer to the Senate version sent over on Friday.
In a strict party line vote, Senate Democrats restored funding for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms that House Republicans had eliminated in their original proposal to extend government funding beyond the end..."
"Police shot and killed a woman who led them on a car chase Thursday from the White House to the U.S. Capitol, injuring two officers and forcing a short-lived lockdown of the sprawling complex, law enforcement officials said.
During a news conference Thursday evening, officials also said that a girl, who was approximately 1 year old and was in the Black Infiniti sedan, is in good condition and in protective custody. Police described a fast-moving incident in which the sedan rammed the outer gate at the White House and..."
"A woman driving a black Infiniti with a young child inside tried to ram through a White House barricade Thursday, then led police on a chase toward the Capitol, where police shot and killed her, witnesses and officials said.
Tourists watched the shooting unfold on Constitution Avenue outside the Capitol as lawmakers inside debated how to end a government shutdown. Police quickly locked down the entire complex temporarily, and both houses of Congress went into recess.
Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Tex., who said he was briefed by the Homeland Security Department,..."
"Kimberly Wooster gazed sadly into the fire she tended across the street from where police killed George Floyd, processing the reality that voters had rejected a proposal aimed at replacing the city's Police Department.
""I had hope,"" she said quietly. ""I really did.""
Hours before, the activists who had helped turn the intersection into an epicenter for the police reform movement warmed burritos in the fire. They discussed how the past 527 days had changed the dialogue on public safety as they awaited results from the polls.
But their hopes..."
"The United States and Russia continued to clash over the fate of Ukraine, with President Biden warning Thursday that the threat of a Russian attack remained “very high,” even as the Kremlin insisted that it was withdrawing troops from border areas and said in writing it was not planning an invasion.
But Russia repeated its threat of unspecified “military-technical measures” if the United States did not accede to its demands for sweeping changes to security arrangements in Eastern Europe, a signal that President Vladimir V. Putin would use his large-scale..."
"Donald Trump's spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, lashed out at former Vice President Mike Pence for backing a number of non-MAGA Republicans in this year's primaries ahead of a potential 2024 presidential bid, calling him ""desperate to chase his lost relevance.""
""Mike Pence was set to lose a governor's race in 2016 before he was plucked up and his political career was salvaged,"" Budowich told The New York Times. ""Now, desperate to chase his lost relevance, Pence is parachuting into races, hoping someone is paying attention. The reality is, President Trump is already 82-3..."
"The Trump administration on Monday announced it will be suspending some employment-based visas for foreigners to protect American workers as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic — a move derided by companies who say they need access to skilled labor that they can’t get in the United States.
The suspension, which will stay in place through the end of the year, will not immediately impact workers already in the US."
"A cease-fire between Israel and Hamas took effect early Friday morning, hours after both sides agreed to end more than 10 days of fighting that had claimed hundreds of lives.
The truce, mediated by Egypt, began at 2 a.m. in Israel — 7 p.m. Thursday in the Eastern United States — as people on either side of the divide watched nervously to see whether it would hold.
In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced on Thursday evening that his security cabinet had voted unanimously to accept the Egyptian proposal,..."
"Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire Thursday, halting a bruising 11-day war that caused widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip, brought life in much of Israel to a standstill and left more than 200 people dead.
At 2 a.m. local time, just as the cease-fire took effect, frenzy life returned to the streets of Gaza. People went out of their homes, some shouting “Allahu Akbar” or whistling from balconies. Many fired in the air, celebrating the truce.
Like the three previous wars between the bitter enemies, the latest round..."
"The US Capitol is once again secured but a woman is dead after supporters of President Donald Trump breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation's capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that will confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win.
Shortly after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers ""traitors"" for..."
"President Donald Trump says he's ""very strongly"" considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich (blah-GOY'-uh-vich), who is serving a 14-year prison term for multiple federal corruption convictions.
Trump suggested more than a year ago that he was considering a commutation for Blagojevich, who then filed paperwork requesting one.
The Republican president told reporters Wednesday night while returning to Washington that he thought Blagojevich, a Democrat, had been treated ""unbelievably unfairly."""
"I will not live in fear. And neither will the 700,000 undocumented immigrants like me.
Two years ago, when President Donald Trump moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, I said, “I’ll see you in court, Mr. President.” Now, the case that bears my name, McAleenan v. Vidal, is one of three consolidated cases that has reached the highest court in the land. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on which my future hangs.
As a person who depends on DACA to remain in..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a highly anticipated set of cases that threatens the legal status of some 700,000 young immigrants — often called DREAMers — who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. It's a program that President Trump tried to rescind seven months after taking office, only to have the lower courts block his action.
In 2012, President Barack Obama put the program in place to temporarily protect these young people from deportation. If you were in school, were a high school graduate, or..."
"As he makes a highly anticipated appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Attorney General William P. Barr is expected to face critical questions from Democrats about the government’s response to anti-police brutality protests across the nation, his controversial interventions in high-profile cases and an array of other matters.
Barr will tell the House Judiciary Committee that President Trump has not inappropriately intervened in Justice Department business — even though Barr has more than once moved in criminal cases to help the president’s allies — and he will defend..."
"Chief Justice John Roberts offered a rare rebuke of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday after the New York Democrat made what Roberts called ""threatening statements"" against two conservative justices.
Schumer had spoken outside the Supreme Court earlier in the day as the justices were hearing a case about a Louisiana abortion law. Schumer addressed two Trump-appointed associate justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
""I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,"" Schumer..."
"Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement rebuking Chuck Schumer for comments the Senate minority leader made about Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
Schumer, speaking at a rally of abortion rights supporters, appeared to threaten Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's two Supreme Court nominees who were confirmed after bruising nomination fights.
""I want to tell you Gorsuch. I want to tell you Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if..."
"Lawmakers and Jewish organizations, including the Anne Frank Center, are calling for White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s resignation, after Spicer tried to drum up support for more U.S. military attacks against the Syrian regime by comparing Assad to Hitler and falsely claiming Hitler never used chemical weapons."
"Stephen Bannon’s criminal indictment for fraud was dismissed by a judge who ruled the action was required by former President Donald Trump’s pardon of his one-time adviser.
U.S. prosecutors opposed the move, although they didn’t dispute the validity of the pardon or the fact that it ends the case against Bannon. The government had asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan to direct the court clerk to remove him as a defendant in the case, which is going forward against his co-defendants. 
Torres said in a ruling Monday that..."
"An indictment against Steve Bannon was dismissed Tuesday over the objection of prosecutors who said it should stand despite ex-President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon his former chief strategist.
The dismissal came in a written ruling by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, who called it the “proper course.”
The Manhattan jurist said it was not the practice of the region’s federal courts to remove a defendant from a case’s docket without resolving the indictment. And she noted that the pardon does not by itself render a defendant innocent of the..."
"Obama floated the idea of mandatory voting in the U.S. while speaking to a civic group in Cleveland on Wednesday. Asked about the corrosive influence of money in U.S. elections, Obama digressed into the related topic of voting rights and said the U.S. should be making it easier — not harder— for people to vote."
"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department rejected a last-ditch appeal from defense lawyers for the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, as prosecutors have appeared close to charging him in a criminal case.
Lawyers for Mr. McCabe, who is being investigated over whether he lied to internal investigators about dealings with the news media, had argued that prosecutors lacked evidence to charge him. The lawyers detailed their position to top officials including Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy attorney general, who ultimately rejected..."
"WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors recommended seeking criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision Thursday.
McCabe was fired from the FBI just before his retirement in March 2018 after the Justice Department's internal watchdog concluded that he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Investigators concluded that he displayed a lack of candor when asked..."
"Just a few weeks after Google threatened to leave Australia if the government forced tech platforms to pay for news, the search giant is suddenly showering money on its most demanding critics.
With groundbreaking legislation expected to pass this week or next, Google has sought to blunt the impact by striking deals of its own with media companies, including two in recent days worth tens of millions of dollars a year. Another, with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, was announced on Wednesday in a three-year arrangement that includes content from The..."
"Facebook said on Wednesday that it is preventing people inside Australia from accessing news stories on its platform. Facebook users elsewhere will not be able to view or share news stories from Australian outlets. The moves are a response to proposed legislation that would force social media platforms to pay Australian news organizations for links shared on its sites.
Facebook's announcement came the same day Google said it had reached a deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, to pay for its..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed how she got the news that her husband, Paul, had been attacked, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she was “very scared” when there was a knock on the door from Capitol Police.
Pelosi said in her first sit-down interview since the attack that she had been asleep in Washington, DC, after getting in the night before from San Francisco when her doorbell rang early in the morning. “I look up, I see it’s 5 [a.m. ET], they must be at the wrong apartment,” she told Cooper..."
"Sudan and Israel have agreed to normalise relations, US President Donald Trump announced on Friday at the White House, a move that was denounced by Palestinians as a “new stab in the back”.
Trump, who is seeking re-election on November 3, sealed the agreement in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, senior US officials said."
"Payroll growth was disappointing for a second straight month in September as employers added 156,000 jobs, which raised questions about the health of an economy that was expected to perk up from a prolonged slump in the second half of the year.
The unemployment rate rose to 5% from 4.9%, the Labor Department said Friday, as a rise in employment was more than offset by a sharp increase in the labor force, or the number of Americans working and looking for jobs.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast 172,000 payroll..."
"Amid a presidential campaign marked by fears about the country’s economic future, the American jobs machine keeps chugging.
Employers added 156,000 positions in September, the Labor Department said on Friday, enough to accommodate new entrants to the labor force and entice back workers who dropped out after the Great Recession. The unemployment rate, which had been stuck at 4.9 percent since spring, ticked up slightly to 5 percent, but that was mostly because more people were drawn into the labor force by evidence that hiring is still going strong.
For..."
"Filings for unemployment insurance slid again last week, placing them at another pandemic-era low.
Jobless claims reached 290,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a slight increase to 300,000 claims. The print marked a third consecutive decline.
The previous week's total was revised to 296,000 from 293,000.
Continuing claims — which count Americans filing for ongoing unemployment insurance benefits — dipped to 2.48 million for the week that ended October 9. That beat the median estimate of 2.55 million claims...."
"New weekly jobless claims held below 300,000 for a back-to-back week as labor market conditions trudged back toward pre-pandemic levels.  
The Labor Department released its jobless claims report Thursday morning. Here were the main metrics from the print, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:
Last week's initial unemployment claims fell by a greater-than-expected margin, bringing the number of new filings back to the lowest level since March 2020. The four-week moving average for new jobless claims also dropped by 15,250 to reach 319,750 as of last week, also marking the least..."
"Georgia’s top elections official on Monday recertified the state’s election results after a recount requested by President Donald Trump confirmed once again that Democrat Joe Biden won the state, and the governor then recertified the state’s 16 presidential electors.
“We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said during a news conference at the state Capitol before the results were recertified.
Georgia law allows a losing candidate to request a recount if the margin between the candidates is within..."
"The Biden administration will release an intelligence report as early as Thursday that concludes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, three U.S. officials familiar with the matter said.
The intelligence assessment, based largely on work by the CIA, is not new; NBC News was among the organizations that confirmed it in 2018.
But its public release will mark a significant new chapter in the U.S.-Saudi relationship and a clear break by President Joe Biden with former President Donald Trump's policy of..."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) hit back at a minor league baseball team that depicted her as an “enemy of freedom” in a Memorial Day tribute clip by revealing a regular morning ritual she goes through to ensure her safety.
The lawmaker on Tuesday responded to a controversial video that the Fresno Grizzlies aired at Chukchansi Park with a Twitter thread explaining how her life has changed due to “the flood of death threats” that those kind of “hateful messages” inspire."
"WASHINGTON — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., explained on Twitter Tuesday evening that she gets death threats because of ""hateful messages"" aired by groups like Fox News and other outlets.
Her comments follow a minor league baseball team's apology for showing a video during a Memorial Day game that juxtaposed an image of the freshman congresswoman alongside images of Kim Jong Un and Fidel Castro.
""I‘ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it’s always..."
"Republicans in Congress have seen the threat of mob violence, and they are going to do something about it.
They’re going to defend the mob, and make sure law enforcement doesn’t crack down too hard on it.
That’s the clear message being sent from up and down the right — politicians, pundits, and conservative media — in response to a memorandum from the Department of Justice laying out an effort to address the rising tide of angry threats directed at school boards and education officials.
The memorandum itself may have been..."
"Last year, Americans could buy a house or rent relatively cheaply due to rock-bottom interest rates and pandemic-era deals meant to fill empty apartments. But that was only a brief reprieve from a housing market crisis brewing in the US for decades. 
Soaring housing and rent prices made up a large portion of the increases in the latest inflation report released on Tuesday. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that housing costs increased 0.7% in August after rising 0.5% the month prior. Americans are now paying 6.2% more for shelter than they..."
"President Biden was “doing fine” after falling off balance while boarding Air Force One before his Friday trip to Atlanta, according to a press secretary traveling with him.
“It’s pretty windy outside,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary, told reporters traveling with Mr. Biden to Georgia. “It’s very windy. I almost fell coming up the steps myself. He is doing 100 percent fine.”
Mr. Biden was boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland when he stumbled about midway up the stairs. He leaned down to catch..."
"As President Trump’s public impeachment hearings get underway Wednesday on Capitol Hill, a slightly smaller-scale impeachment probe is unfolding at the University of Florida. UF’s student president is facing his own impeachment inquiry after he helped bring Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle to campus last month at a reported cost of $50,000. The school’s student government has served President Michael Murphy with the impeachment resolution, arguing that last month’s speaking engagement amounted to a misuse of student fees. They argue Trump and Guilfoyle were paid with mandatory..."
"President Obama claimed credit on Tuesday for an improving economy and defiantly told his Republican adversaries in Congress to “turn the page” by supporting an expensive domestic agenda aimed at improving the fortunes of the middle class.
Released from the political constraints of a sagging economy, overseas wars and elections, Mr. Obama declared in his sixth State of the Union address that “the shadow of crisis has passed,” and he vowed to use his final two years in office fighting for programs that had taken a back seat.
He called..."
"What a hot mess.
Rudy Giuliani sweated so much during a press conference Thursday that streaks of what appeared to be dark hair dye streamed down his cheeks, making for a bizarre juxtaposition as the ex-mayor insisted without evidence that Democrats stole the election from President Trump.
Giuliani, who’s spearheading the Trump campaign’s bumbling legal battle to overturn Joe Biden’s election, did not appear to notice the black liquid dripping down from his sideburns, though he kept dabbing pearls of sweat from his face with a napkin.
It’s unclear what..."
"Journalist Helen Thomas died Saturday at the age of 92, according to The Gridiron Club & Foundation. Over the decades, she made her mark as a woman journalist who shattered barriers in the nation's capital and as someone who invariably spoke her mind. She became a fixture at the White House, too, but her career came to an ignominious end due to her bluntly expressed opinions — especially her criticism of Israel and Jews."
"The U.S. military mission in Iraq could go on for months, President Barack Obama said Saturday, but a long-term solution involving the Iraqi government will take much longer.
The president, who once referred to the Islamic State as a “JV team,” also acknowledged that the militants advanced more rapidly in Iraq than anyone predicted."
"The U.S. launched a new airdrop Saturday to aid thousands of members of an Iraqi minority group who fled from Islamic extremists, as Iraq's foreign minister said U.S. airstrikes have helped Kurdish forces counter the militants' advance.
An American military team is currently in the Kurdish regional capital Irbil, working to ensure tactical coordination with Kurdish peshmerga forces, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told a press conference late Friday.

"The White House has informed governors about the number of Afghan refugees they can expect to be resettled in their states in coming weeks, an administration official told CNN Thursday.
Former Delaware governor Jack Markell and former FEMA acting head Bob Fenton, who are overseeing the resettlement efforts, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and other senior White House officials made the calls to the governors on Wednesday, the official said.
According to the official, the allocations to each state were made under the new Afghan Placement and Assistance (APA) Program and were..."
"Prosecutors in Cook County, Ill., dropped charges against Jussie Smollett on Tuesday, an astonishing reversal that came a month after the actor was arrested, charged with lying to police about a bigoted attack and pilloried by Chicago’s top police official on live television.
Prosecutors announced their decision only 18 days after a grand jury had indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts. In dropping the charges, officials cited the actor’s history of volunteer work and the two days of community service he had performed since his arrest, as well as his..."
"Now what, Jussie Smollett?
In the space of two months, the ""Empire"" star, 36, has gone from crime victim to indicted crime suspect and back to victim again, now claiming total exoneration after Chicago prosecutors abandoned their case against him Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chicago police and Mayor Rahm Emanuel continued to shout angrily about his alleged guilt.
Cook County prosecutors are not explaining why they did what they did, so the public is still in the dark about what happened and why. Officially, Smollett's record is expunged but there's..."
"In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait in a naked war of territorial aggression. The next year, the US and an allied coalition intervened under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council, repulsing the Iraqi invasion. Today, as Russia is engaged in a similar aggressive war against Ukraine, there is no similar American effort in the offing — even as Ukrainian leaders have pleaded for Western assistance.
There are many dissimilarities between the situations in 1991 and 2022, but the biggest one is this: Saddam Hussein, rather famously, did not have nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin..."
"Secret Service agents assigned to a Washington investigative team were asked to monitor the safety of an aide to the agency’s director, the Washington Post reported Sunday, though the duties of the agents and the length of observation were disputed by a Secret Service spokesman.
The Post, in an article citing three people familiar with the operation, reported that agents within the service’s “Prowler” program went twice per day to the Maryland home of Lisa Chopey, the assistant to then-Director Mark Sullivan."
"Top Secret Service officials ­ordered members of a special unit responsible for patrolling the White House perimeter to abandon their posts over at least two months in 2011 in order to protect a personal friend of the agency’s director, according to three people familiar with the operation.
The new assignment, known internally as Operation Moonlight, diverted agents to a rural area outside the southern Maryland town of La Plata, nearly an hour’s drive from Washington. Agents were told that then-Director Mark Sullivan was concerned that his assistant was being harassed..."
"Joelle Wheatley hit her pandemic-parenting rock bottom after her son was sent home from day care for a second time, with the sniffles, due to stricter health guidelines in a symptom-sensitive COVID-19 world.
It was supposed to be Jacob’s first day back after a stressful 10-day home quarantine for another mild symptom that turned out to be harmless. Frustrated, desperate — there were no other care options, and she needed to focus on work — and certain that the 2-year-old’s runny nose and cough were also benign, the Seattle mom..."
"Four times as many women as men dropped out of the labor force in September, roughly 865,000 women compared with 216,000 men. This validates predictions that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women—and the accompanying child care and school crises—would be severe. In July, a Washington Post article—titled, “Coronavirus child-care crisis will set women back a generation”—pointed out that “[o]ne out of four women who reported becoming unemployed during the pandemic said it was because of a lack of child care—twice the rate among men.”1 In August, CNN ran..."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved the first new medication for Alzheimer’s disease in nearly two decades, a contentious decision, made despite opposition from the agency’s independent advisory committee and some Alzheimer’s experts who said there was not enough evidence that the drug can help patients.
The drug, aducanumab, which will go by the brand name Aduhelm, is a monthly intravenous infusion intended to slow cognitive decline in people, with mild memory and thinking problems. It is the first approved treatment to attack the disease process of Alzheimer’s instead of just..."
"Russian missiles destroyed an airport in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro and five emergency workers were injured in the attack.
“There has been another attack on Dnipro airport. There is nothing left of it,” Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region, said on Sunday.
“The airport itself and the infrastructure around it has been destroyed. Rockets keep flying and flying,” Reznichenko said on Telegram.
A missile also hit a building in the city’s Pavlohrad district, and emergency workers were combing through an infrastructure facility that was hit in the..."
"Russia claimed that it destroyed several air defense systems in Ukraine over the weekend, in what appeared to be a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv has described as crucial ahead of a broad new offensive in the east.
In one strike announced Monday, Moscow said that it hit four S-300 launchers provided by a European country it didn’t name. Slovakia gave Ukraine just such a system last week but denied it had been destroyed. Russia previously reported two strikes on similar systems in other places.
Moscow’s..."
"Mike Pence is now in charge of the United States’ response to coronavirus, Donald Trump announced at a press conference Wednesday night. Mike Pence’s qualifications, per Trump, include that he is “terrific in many ways,” “very good on health care,” and “really very expert at the field.” OK! Here are a few fast facts about Mike Pence and public health:
• When he was governor of Indiana, Mike Pence signed anti-abortion bills at a rate of two per year.
• Mike Pence has argued that sending kids to daycare stunts..."
"US President Joe Biden has landed in Tel Aviv in Israel on his first visit to the Middle East in his current role.
Arriving on Air Force One at Ben Gurion airport on Wednesday, Biden was warmly greeted by Israeli officials and, in a speech, described the US’s connection with the country as “bone-deep”.
“You don’t need to be a Jew to be a Zionist,” said Biden in his opening remarks. “The connection between the Israeli and American people is bone deep … I am proud to say that US..."
"New York (CNN) -- Bari Weiss, a controversial opinion writer for The New York Times, resigned from the newspaper on Monday, blasting the institution on her way out in a scathing letter explaining why she chose to leave her job.
In the resignation letter Weiss posted online Tuesday, the self-described ""politically homeless"" writer criticized The Times for fostering what she called an ""illiberal environment"" that she said was ""especially heartbreaking.""
""Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times,"" Weiss wrote. ""But Twitter has become its ultimate..."
"Speaking to his favorite morning television hosts Friday, President Trump offered a window into his state of mind as he faces his greatest political threat yet.
As his unfiltered thoughts streamed from his mind, through a telephone receiver and onto the airwaves of Fox News for 53 minutes, it became clear that the prospect of impeachment has changed nothing about Trump’s un­or­tho­dox approach to the presidency.
He continued to make lofty promises of soon-to-come bombshells, peddle falsehoods, spread long-debunked conspiracy theories, attack his perceived enemies and dabble in misogynistic tropes..."
"The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel's impeachment investigation, the first vote the committee has taken related to the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump.
The party-line vote came as House Democrats have struggled to define the committee's probe, with Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler saying the committee is conducting an impeachment inquiry, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders are refraining from calling it that.
Thursday's vote, which does not need to be approved by the full House, gives Nadler..."
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have reached an agreement to create a one-time process that would let Democrats raise the debt ceiling on their votes alone, a deal that underscores the lengths the GOP leader will go to avoid a damaging default without Republican support to increase the national borrowing limit.
The House took the first step to implement the plan on Tuesday by voting to pass new legislation that will set up the debt limit process. The final vote was 222-212. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois..."
"COVID-19 has shattered the basic economic rationale President Donald Trump had put forward in running for reelection and forced him to come up with another: Joe Biden’s handling of the catastrophe would be worse.
Trump and his allies are working to graft his own vulnerabilities onto Biden, painting him as a feeble alternative to a president tested by the coronavirus pandemic and the economic tailspin it’s caused. In TV ads and public statements, they’re arguing that Biden couldn’t revive the economy, defeat the virus, or stand up to Chinese leaders,..."
"Has the U.S. economy hit bottom?
Just a few short months ago, Trump planned to campaign for reelection on the back of a robust economy. That’s a distant memory after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April, leading to an unemployment rate of 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.
Economists suggest the genuine unemployment number is much higher. Trump is encouraging states to reopen their economies to help reverse the slide, even as health experts warn that reopening too soon could lead to a second wave that..."
"The story of Donald Trump’s doomed campaign has been replaced by the story of his inevitability as the Republican nominee.
It’s a sea change indicative of his constant ability to defy expectations. He placed second in the nation’s first contest in Iowa, went on to dominate in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and won Nevada’s GOP caucus on Tuesday night.
But it’s no"
"For weeks, Marco Rubio’s strategy has been dubbed “3-2-1,” meaning, come in third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, and first in South Carolina. Now, Rubio seems to have tweaked the formula to something more like 3-5-2-3-2-3-2-3-2-3-2. For some reason this still makes Rubio the prohibitive favorite, according to some of our prognosticators. The Florida senator has recently picked up establishment backers, including Bob Dole and Tim Pawlenty, and important new donors, several of them availed from the wreckage of the Jeb Bush campaign. Many forecasters now speak of a..."
"Federal immigration officials raided several food-processing plants in Mississippi Wednesday and arrested approximately 680 people believed to be working without authorization.
The coordinated raids were conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations ""at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi,"" according to an ICE statement. In addition to the arrests, agents also seized company business records."
"On Wednesday morning, Dianne received an alarming call. It was her fiancé, dialing her from the chicken processing plant in a nearby central Mississippi town where he worked long shifts deboning meat.
“ICE is here!” he yelled. In the background, Dianne could hear other laborers terrified. The panic was palpable. One worker called out in Spanish, “Ayúdame! [Help me!]”"
"Despite his populist rhetoric on the campaign trail, Donald Trump revealed with his proposal for the federal budget that he’s actually just a hyper-conservative Republican that wants to starve the poor so the rich can build mansions for their dogs. The White House’s budget, released on Tuesday, recommends $4.1 trillion in spending cuts, mainly for social services."
The House plans to vote Wednesday on a measure that would leave the $16.4 trillion borrowing limit intact but suspend it from the time the bill passes until mid-May. The declaration that the debt ceiling “shall not apply means that the government could continue borrowing to cover its obligations to creditors until May 18.
"In escalating his trade war, President Donald Trump is persisting in his deceptive argument that tariffs are a pure win for the U.S. and a loss for China. He will not acknowledge that the costs of tariffs are being borne by Americans.
Trump has vowed to impose a blanket tariff of 25% on everything Americans buy from China. That would mean raising tariffs from 10% on $200 billion worth of goods by the end of the week and hitting an additional $325 billion in Chinese products with the same penalty..."
"President Trump’s aggressive trade policies are running headlong into his campaign for reelection.
As Trump prepares to run on the economy, his threat to increase tariffs on imports from China has sent the stock market diving and undercut a stretch of positive economic news. U.S. farmers and exporters, already bearing the brunt of China’s retaliatory tariffs, now face the prospect of an escalated trade war in which states that Trump needs to win reelection will be in the crosshairs.
The trade war has also exposed a rift inside the White..."
"WASHINGTON – A man accused of telling an African-American Georgia state lawmaker to ""go back to where you came from"" because she had too many items in the express checkout line at a grocery store disputes her version of events and denies that he said anything racist.

"The seemingly-unstoppable juggernaut towards same-sex marriage rights across the country was halted at least briefly Wednesday after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy blocked a federal appeals court ruling that voided same-sex marriage bans in Nevada and Idaho.
Acting on an emergency application from Idaho officials, Kennedy issued a one-page order Wednesday staying the ruling the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals released Tuesday.
Kennedy's order offered no rationale for the stay, but instructed those challenging the gay marriage bans to file a response by Thursday afternoon to Idaho's request.

"A federal appeals court on Tuesday struck down same-sex marriage bans in Idaho and in Nevada, the latest in a nearly unbroken string of courtroom victories for gay couples.
The decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, came a day after the Supreme Court allowed similar rulings by three other appeals courts to stand, clearing the way for same-sex marriage to start immediately in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin and to be extended soon to six other states in those circuits...."
"Two years into the coronavirus pandemic, the American right is still consumed with hatred for White House adviser Anthony S. Fauci. So much so that not only do they scheme to destroy Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, but their obsession sometimes devolves into violent fantasies.
Speaking at a conference of the right-wing “youth” organization Turning Point USA, Fox News host Jesse Watters instructed the assembled activists on how they should track down and confront Fauci, to create a viral moment that Fox could then use to..."

They come on during prime-time network TV, pop up while you're cheering on the Buckeyes or the Broncos and they even get you when you're cruising to your favorite station on the way to work.
The reason for such a concentrated air war is that voters in swing states like Colorado and Ohio could decide the election.

"When I first considered Barack Obamas re-election chances in this magazine, last November, he was about a 50-50 contender against the Republican field. As I noted then, this was an unusual spot for a sitting president. A year before their own re-election races, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and both Bushes were all favored. One year out, it seemed as if things could break either way for the president in 2012."

"After being encircled by Ukrainian forces, Russia pulled troops out Saturday from an eastern Ukrainian city that it had been using as a front-line hub. It was the latest victory for the Ukrainian counteroffensive that has humiliated and angered the Kremlin.
Russia’s withdrawal from Lyman complicates its internationally vilified declaration just a day earlier that it had annexed four regions of Ukraine — an area that includes Lyman. Taking the city paves the way for Ukrainian troops to potentially push further into land that Moscow now illegally claims as its..."

"Now that fired police officer Derek Chauvin has been convicted on all three counts against him, he can still file an appeal. But the odds are not good, considering some 90% of appeals are denied across the United States.
An appeal in the case is a virtual certainty. But what issues Chauvin's lawyers raise to the appellate court are an open question, according to criminal defense experts.
The range in appeal possibilities could run from the possible bias of jurors, the refusal by Judge Peter Cahill to move the..."

The pregnant actress stood in front of live TV cameras and used her Golden Globes acceptance speech for her performance in Fosse/Verdon to explain how having an abortion helped her decide when and with whom to have children and urged women to use their voting power to help reshape our government.

"The addition of Carly Fiorina (not a white man) and Ben Carson (not a white man) to a Republican 2016 field that already includes Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul means that the 2016 Republican field will likely be the most diverse from either party since at least 1992.

"Turns out the ""gotcha"" moment in Thursday's New Hampshire debate wasn't so clear cut.
Republican Scott Brown, who is vying for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's seat, appeared to botch a question on New Hampshire geography during the final debate in the contentious race.
But after some post-debate map-checking, the former senator from Massachusetts, who moved back to New Hampshire after losing his Senate seat in 2013, actually got an apology from the reporter who questioned the candidate's familiarity with state geography.
So did Brown get it right and"
"Republican Senate challenger Scott Brown's efforts to cast himself as a New Hampshire native went awry in his final debate against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) on Thursday when a question on economic problems facing Sullivan County turned into a geography lesson.
WMUR's James Pindell, a debate moderator, asked Brown and Shaheen to specify what is and isn't working economically for Sullivan County, which is located in far western New H"
"After answering questions Monday morning about two of the controversies that have undermined his administration, President Obama flew off to New York to raise money for the Democratic Party. There, before partisan donors, he reflected on his second term and said he will continue to reach out to Republicans. “I sure want to do some governing, he explained.
Obamas words suggest that he believes there is a way to compartmentalize the business of his second term: legislative and other business here, scandals over there. But things are too messy for..."
"Secretly accessing phone records of journalists. IRS targeting of conservative groups. Misleading statements last year about the Benghazi terrorist attack.
News headlines of the past week portray an administration engulfed in potential scandal, providing opponents of President Barack Obama with plenty of ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term.
The scenario invites comparisons to previous presidents who faced controversies in their ""lame duck"" second terms, such as the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration and Bill Clinton's impeachment for perjury..."
"Nebraska's conservative legislators ""argued that the death penalty is a wasteful and ineffective government program that costs too much and accomplishes too little,"" according to Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. That's probably correct: because of intense and extended litigation, imposing the death penalty in the US is significantly more expensive than sentencing someone to life without parole.
This argument, al"
"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday drew firm distinctions between the United States and Russia as he sought to make the case that the US is the better partner for countries in Africa.
In a speech about the Biden administration’s “strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa,” delivered in Pretoria, South Africa, the top US diplomat argued that “the United States and African nations can’t achieve any of our shared priorities – whether that’s recovering from the pandemic, creating broad-based economic opportunities, addressing the climate crisis, expanding energy access, revitalizing democracies,..."
"The Biden administration will begin offering evacuation flights to eligible Afghan citizens who aided the U.S. and its allies in the war at the end of the month, a senior White House official said Wednesday.
The official said the flights will be offered to people who are in the process of obtaining special immigrant visas, or SIVs, through the State Department, as well as their families."
"Federal officials say theyre preparing to release the jobs and unemployment report on schedule Friday, following up on earlier statements suggesting Hurricane Sandy may delay the closely watched report until after the election.
The department is “working hard to ensure the timely release of the report, said Gary Steinberg, spokesman for the Labor Department. “It is our intention that Friday will be business as usual."
"Hurricane Sandy could cause a delay in the release of the highly-anticipated October jobs report set for this Friday.
The report is normally released at 8:30 a.m. ET the first Friday of the month. This month's report is the final reading on the health of the job market before the presidential election.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Monday it hopes to stay on the normal schedule and is working hard to try to do so. But because of the shutdown of federal government offices due to the..."
"The U.S. military announced Wednesday that it has charged Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl with one count of desertion and one count of misbehavior before the enemy by endangering his unit. Army officials said they were referring the case to a preliminary hearing.
The 28-year-old Hailey, Idaho, native became the only known American prisoner of war in Afghanistan after his disappearance from his base in 2009. Last year, Bergdahl was handed over to U.S. forces by the Taliban in exchange for the release of five Afghan detainees who were being held at..."
"The U.S. military has charged Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, officials announced Wednesday afternoon.
Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan before being captured and held captive for five years. For that, he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison, and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped for his rank, Army Col. Daniel King said as he announced the charges.
Bergdahl now faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury..."
"The United States is experiencing an extreme teenage mental-health crisis. From 2009 to 2021, the share of American high-school students who say they feel “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” rose from 26 percent to 44 percent, according to a new CDC study. This is the highest level of teenage sadness ever recorded.
The government survey of almost 8,000 high-school students, which was conducted in the first six months of 2021, found a great deal of variation in mental health among different groups. More than one in four girls reported that they..."
"(CNN) - It's the bottom of the ninth in Iowa as Democratic candidates make their closing arguments before the all-important Iowa caucus on Monday. Having worked as the communications director for the presidential campaigns of Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz — the last three Republicans to win the Iowa caucuses — I have insight into what works in the Hawkeye State.
And if the Democratic candidates want to be competitive, I would encourage them to keep the following lessons in mind."
"The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol sent letters on Monday seeking interviews with three Republican members of Congress, and the panel said it had gathered evidence that some House Republicans sought presidential pardons in the aftermath of the violence that engulfed the Capitol.
The committee is requesting interviews with Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, the former leader of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus; Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, who has said former President Donald J. Trump has continued to seek reinstatement to office; and Representative Ronny Jackson of Texas, Mr. Trump’s..."
"The Supreme Court Monday left in place a Kentucky law requiring abortion providers to perform an ultrasound and show and describe it to the patient, regardless of the patient's wishes.
The justices did not offer an explanation for their decision to refuse to hear a challenge to a lower court ruling that upheld the Kentucky restrictions. The law, which had been blocked by lower courts since 2017 when it was enacted, will now take effect."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday left in place a Kentucky law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and show fetal images to patients before abortions.
The justices did not comment in refusing to review an appeals court ruling that upheld the law. Enforcement of the law had been on hold pending the legal challenge but will begin shortly, said Steve Pitt, general counsel to Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin.
The American Civil Liberties Union had challenged the law on behalf of Kentucky’s lone remaining abortion clinic. The ACLU argued..."
"Russia this week sent a formal diplomatic note to the United States warning that U.S. and NATO shipments of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine were “adding fuel” to the conflict there and could bring “unpredictable consequences.”
The diplomatic démarche, a copy of which was reviewed by The Washington Post, came as President Biden approved a dramatic expansion in the scope of weapons being provided to Ukraine, an $800 million package including 155 mm howitzers — a serious upgrade in long-range artillery to match Russian systems — coastal defense..."
"Has the novel coronavirus in Italy changed in some significant way? That was the suggestion of a top doctor in northern Italy who reports that patients to his hospital have been showing up with lower levels of the virus in their upper respiratory tracts compared with those two months ago.
Alberto Zangrillo, head of San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, roiled the global public health community on Sunday when he told RAI, the national TV station, that “the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,” with patients showing minute amounts of..."
"Democratic Party leaders scrambled on Monday night to rescue their convention from political bedlam as supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders erupted in boos, jeers and protests against Hillary Clinton after an email leak showed that party officials had sought to undermine Mr. Sanders in their race for the nomination."
"A federal judge in Florida has tossed a racketeering lawsuit that Donald Trump filed against Hillary Clinton and a slew of other defendants—dismantling his claims one by one in an absolutely withering critique.
“It is not simply that I find the Amended Complaint ‘inadequate in any respect,’” Judge Donald Middlebrooks writes at one point. “It is inadequate in nearly every respect.”
Trump filed the suit in March alleging that Clinton and the others “orchestrated a malicious conspiracy to disseminate patently false and injurious information” about his campaign’s possible collusion with..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he was mistaken in claiming that the Obama administration had failed to leave a pandemic playbook for the Trump White House.
“I was wrong,” McConnell said in an evening interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. “They did leave behind a plan. So, I clearly made a mistake in that regard.”
McConnell had claimed during a Monday campaign event for President Donald Trump that the current White House had not been briefed by the previous administration on preparing for a pandemic at the..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walked back his claim that the Obama administration didn't leave President Donald Trump a plan for pandemics, saying he made a mistake.
McConnell said in a Trump campaign livestreamed event this week that the Obama administration didn't leave Trump ""any kind of game plan for something like this.""
Obama administration officials quickly pushed back on McConnell's claim."
"Republicans are spending the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's election sizing up the possibility of their first Senate majority in nearly a decade, but with key races still too close to call.
Latest polls show some critical Senate races tightening, guaranteeing a night of drama and suspense on Tuesday, as Republicans strive for a net gain of six seats to capture the chamber. A GOP victory would give the party complete control on Capitol Hill and the ability to constrain President Barack"
"This morning, the GOP's chances of taking the Senate rose to their highest yet in Vox's average of the major forecasting models. The new release of the highly-respected Des Moines Register poll was particularly brutal for the party, since it gave Republican Joni Ernst a sizable seven point lead on Democrat Bruce Braley."
"WASHINGTON — Amid the constant political chaos of 2020, there have been a few consistencies. One of them has been a growing Democratic advantage in this fall’s congressional races, particularly the Senate.
For Democrats, the potential for pickups is growing and affecting some places where a tight general election race is not a normal occurrence. From the Mountain West to the South, the list of competitive Senate races for the GOP looks different this year.
Going into this election cycle Republicans knew they were going to be defending a challenging..."
"To date, the January 6 committee has provided a clinical, step by step breakdown of who knew what when in the days leading up to the insurrection at the US Capitol.
The committee's hearing on Tuesday was something quite different -- as Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, provided stirring and intimate details of what happened that day and, specifically, how Donald Trump acted.
It was, in a word, ugly.
Three moments stand out:
1) Hutchinson said she was told that when Trump..."
"The Senate Judiciary Committee and lawyers for the woman who has accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago reached a tentative agreement on Saturday for her to publicly testify on Thursday, an apparent breakthrough that could alter the course of a bitter confirmation fight."
"A senior Department of Homeland Security official alleges that he was told to stop providing intelligence reports on the threat of Russian interference in the 2020 election, in part because it “made the President look bad,” an instruction he believed would jeopardize national security.
The official, Brian Murphy, who until recently was in charge of intelligence and analysis at DHS, said in a whistleblower complaint that on two occasions he was told to stand down on reporting about the Russian threat and alleged that senior officials told him to modify..."
"Arizona was solidly Donald Trump country in its primary last month, with Republican voters choosing the billionaire businessman by a 22-point margin.
But when party activists gathered in Mesa, a Phoenix suburb, on Saturday, it was Ted Cruz who walked away with most of the delegates.
The Texas senator won at least 35 of the 55 delegates up for election at the Arizona GOP state convention. All of them -- plus three other party officials who hold delegate slots -- must vote for Donald Trump on the first round of..."
"The Ukrainian soldiers arrived like heroes, greeted with kisses and songs. In the city of Kherson, which had endured months of Russian occupation, residents poured into the streets on Friday. They hoisted Ukrainian flags, and danced in joy around a glowing bonfire.
Their excitement, which was captured on videos they sent out to the world, did not erase the momentous problems that a brutal war has inflicted. Despite a Russian retreat, there was still uncertainty about the future, worries about further attacks and concerns about the lack of food, fuel..."
"For months the refrain across Cuba has been ""¿hasta cuando?""
How much longer?
Cubans are used to being endlessly patient and inventive in the face of an often dysfunctional daily existence and crushing shortages.
But over the past several years that ability to overcome misfortune has been replaced by a stone-faced reality that life has become as difficult as during any point in their embattled lives.
Relations with the United States often act as a barometer for how optimistically or pessimistically Cubans view their future. When then-President Barack Obama famously declared during his 2016..."
"The race for control of Congress, as well as governorships and key statewide positions, has defined the 2022 midterms.
In Washington, Republicans have had their eyes on breaking the Democratic trifecta by winning one or both chambers of Congress. In battleground states, Democrats are looking to defend vulnerable governors and win crucial down-ballot contests that could prove pivotal in future election fights.
Heading into Election Day, both parties were also looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond. Republicans were excited about growing their roster..."
"Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito delivered candid takes on several divisive issues facing the U.S., from the measures put in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic to tensions between gay rights and religious freedom, during an address to the conservative Federalist Society on Thursday.
Alito said the restrictions imposed by political leaders in order to contain the coronavirus pandemic have ""resulted in previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty"" and denounced recent Supreme Court decisions holding up orders he believed discriminated against religious groups. He argued the pandemic highlighted..."
"On Thursday night, Justice Sam Alito delivered the keynote address at this year’s all-virtual Federalist Society National Lawyers Convention. The Federalist Society, a well-funded network of conservative attorneys, has come under unusual scrutiny after Donald Trump elevated scores of its members to the federal judiciary. Its leaders insist that it is a mere debate club, a nonpartisan forum for the exchange of legal ideas. But Alito abandoned any pretense of impartiality in his speech, a grievance-laden tirade against Democrats, the progressive movement, and the United States’ response to the COVID-19..."
"For many Americans across the country, Donald Trump's victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept.
""Not my president,"" protesters chanted in rallies coast to coast.
Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight -- with demonstrations outside Trump's properties.
While most protesters were peaceful, dozens were arrested. At least three officers were wounded. And about 40 fires were set in one California city.
Here's a snapshot of the rallies across the nation:"
"Thousands of people flooded the streets of downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night, chanting, carrying signs and at one point, burning a papier-mache head of Donald Trump on the steps of City Hall, as they denounced the election of the nation’s next president.
The demonstrations stretched coast to coast, from outside Trump’s iconic tower in New York to high schools in California. In Los Angeles, however, Wednesday’s protest culminated in a place that has recently become a hallmark of civil disobedience in the city."
"FBI agents were looking for secret documents about nuclear weapons among other classified material when they searched Donald Trump’s home on Monday, it has been reported.
The Washington Post cited people familiar with the investigation as saying nuclear weapons documents were thought to be in the trove the FBI was hunting in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. They did not specify what kind of documents or whether they referred to the US arsenal or another country’s.
The report came hours after the attorney general, Merrick Garland, said he had personally authorised the government..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ruled out confirming President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, in a lame duck session after November's election.
In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, the Kentucky Republican stuck by his stance that Obama's successor ought to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia."
"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday ruled out the possibility that the Senate could confirm President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee in a “lame duck” congressional session after the November presidential election.
McConnell was asked whether Republicans might decide to confirm Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland late this year if Democrats win in November. This would open up the possibility of a Democratic president sending the Senate a more liberal nominee next year."
"Police and federal authorities in the US are investigating after a Wisconsin health centre said an employee admitted to deliberately spoiling 500 doses of coronavirus vaccine.
Aurora medical centre, in Grafton, first reported that the doses had been spoiled on Saturday, saying a staff member had accidentally left them out of refrigeration overnight. On Wednesday, however, it said the doses appeared to have been spoiled deliberately.
Police in Grafton, about 20 miles (32km) north of Milwaukee, said the department, the FBI and the Food and Drug Administration were investigating the..."
"Advocate Aurora Health says a now-fired employee intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from a refrigerator last weekend, causing them to become ineffective and be discarded.
Each vial contains enough vaccine for 10 vaccinations.
Initially, Aurora was ""led to believe"" the removal was an error. But Wednesday, the employee ""acknowledged that they intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration,"" according to a statement from the health care provider.
Grafton Police Department said in a statement late Wednesday that it was notified by Aurora shortly after 6 p.m...."
"The nation has been plunged into despair and mourning. A little more than a week after the slaughter of 10 people by a white supremacist in Buffalo, a gunman killed 19 children and 2 adults in Uvalde, Texas, as police stood by in what seems a glacial and incompetent response. The tragedies renewed calls for gun control. In a national address, President Joe Biden called for a coordinated response to take on the gun lobby. Democratic legislatures have moved to pass gun control legislation at the state level.
And in Houston, the National Rifle Association still threw a..."

"Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin departed the governor's mansion three days ago, but the reverberations of some of his final actions are still being felt across the state.
Bevin, a Republican who narrowly lost a bid for a second term last month, issued pardons to hundreds of people, including convicted rapists, murderers and drug offenders.
In one case, Bevin pardoned a man whose whose family raised more than $20,000 to pay off money still owed from his 2015 gubernatorial campaign."
"(CNN)Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin issued 428 pardons in his final days in office after his November defeat to Democrat Andy Beshear, the Louisville Courier Journal reported.
That list includes a man who killed his parents, another convicted of reckless homicide and a woman who threw her newborn in the trash, the Washington Post reported.
Dayton Jones, who was convicted after sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy, was also pardoned according to Kentucky New Era."
"President-elect Donald Trump will nominate former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to serve as secretary of Energy. The former GOP presidential hopeful beat out two contenders for the Cabinet post: Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat representing West Virginia, and Ray Washburne, a Dallas investor working in oil and gas operations."
"This is the second year that Covid-19 has upended holiday travel, after nearly two long years of plans undone, loved ones unseen and life milestones unmarked. Now that vaccines are widely available in the United States, it's especially frustrating that we are still held hostage to a pandemic fueled by the people who refuse to get vaccinated and by the policy choices of wealthy nations not to treat this pandemic like a global pandemic and vaccinate the world.
But here we are, and despite the fact that the United States has some of the..."
"A new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll shows Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) only 7 points behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Iowa caucus, a worrying sign for the Democratic frontrunner. Clinton leads with 37 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, with Sanders following at 30 percent.
As Clinton's campaign struggles to counter negative press from her ongoing email controversy, Sanders has energized liberal Democrats with impassioned talk of political revolution. According to the poll, 96 percent of Sanders supporters said they support him for his ideas, while two..."
"Bernie Sanders, riding an updraft of insurgent passion in Iowa, has closed to within 7 points of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race.
She’s the first choice of 37% of likely Democratic caucusgoers; he’s the pick for 30%, according to a new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll.
But Clinton has lost a third of her supporters since May, a trajectory that if sustained puts her at risk of losing again in Iowa, the initial crucible in the presidential nominating contest."
"Joseph R. Biden Jr. is flipping the script on President Trump, who has tried to frame the election as a choice between keeping the economy open or returning to coronavirus lockdowns under Democrats.
The plight of bars and clubs, many of which remain shuttered and are struggling for survival in the pandemic, is the focus of a new television ad that the Biden campaign aired on CBS on Sunday during an N.F.L. game.
They are places like the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, Mich., which has been a magnet for..."
"(CNN)The Senate on Friday voted to block any witnesses from being called in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, a move that marked the beginning of the end of the third Senate trial for a president in US history.
The timing for the final acquittal vote was a subject of debate throughout the day on Friday, but Republican senators leaving a meeting Friday evening said that it was likely to occur on Wednesday -- after Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday."
"At a time when Latino representation in media is still lacking and the power of Latino outlets owned by Latinos barely even registers, it was exciting to hear in early June that two Latinas with ties to former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised $80 million to form a new national network of radio stations. The Latino Media Network, as it's called, is acquiring 18 existing radio stations.
One such network is a popular conservative Miami station, which explains why my excitement was not shared by..."
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will deny visas to immigrants who cannot prove they will have health insurance or the ability to pay for medical costs once they become permanent residents of the United States, the White House announced Friday in the latest move by President Trump to undermine legal immigration.
Mr. Trump issued a proclamation, effective Nov. 3, ordering consular officers to bar immigrants seeking to live in the United States unless they “will be covered by approved health insurance” or can prove that they have “the financial resources..."
"The U.S. will deny visas to immigrants unless they can prove they can cover their own medical costs, a move aimed at preventing the entry of those who “will be a financial burden to the United States healthcare system.”

The edict highlights President Donald Trump’s tough stance on..."

"President Biden announced Friday that the U.S., European Union and G7 countries are moving to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status over its invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. will also take steps to ban the import of Russian seafood, diamonds and vodka, he said. 
""Each of our nations is going to take steps to deny most favored nation status to Russia,"" he announced. ""A most-favored-nation status designation means two countries have agreed to trade with each other under the best possible terms — low tariffs, few barriers to trade and the highest-possible..."
"Black Americans protesting the violation of their rights are a defining tradition of this country. In the last century, there have been hundreds of uprisings in black communities in response to white violence. Some have produced substantive change. After the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, uprisings in more than 100 cities broke the final congressional deadlock over whether it should be illegal to deny people housing simply because they descended from people who had been enslaved. The Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination..."
"The process was long and winding, but in the end, former vice president Joe Biden landed exactly where he was expected to from the very beginning. Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California was always the safest, most experienced and most tested choice Biden could make.
Harris will create excitement as the first Black woman on a major-party ticket, but no ideological anxiety among middle-of-the road voters. Like Biden, she occupies the Democratic Party’s center ground. And she will raise no questions as to whether she is qualified to take over..."
"As cases of Covid-19 rise throughout the U.S., health officials warn that an increasing number of fully vaccinated people are being hospitalized or going to the emergency room. The concern about waning immunity against severe Covid infection comes as the Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine booster shot for all adults 18 and older.

"Ghislaine Maxwell's answers to questions about the sex-trafficking operation she allegedly ran with the late Jeffrey Epstein were made public Thursday as a federal court released Maxwell's 2016 deposition. The transcript is more than 400 pages long, but it has been redacted to protect the privacy of some people it mentions.
The transcript is finally being unsealed after a back-and-forth legal battle between Maxwell and Virginia Giuffre, who has accused Maxwell, Epstein and others of sexually abusing her when she was a minor. In it, Maxwell repeatedly denies ""recruiting"" girls..."
"A defensive and combative Ghislaine Maxwell, the onetime partner of Jeffrey Epstein, insisted in long-sealed court testimony made public Thursday that she had no knowledge of the deceased financier having sexual contact with minors.
The 2016 testimony — submitted in a lawsuit — was unsealed after Maxwell’s attorneys battled for months to keep it secret. Maxwell was charged earlier this year with trafficking minors in concert with Epstein and with lying under oath in the testimony about her knowledge of Epstein’s activities. Several of Epstein’s accusers have said they were..."
"Power outages across Texas have left millions of people in the dark and bitter cold this week amid an unprecedented winter storm that buried the state in snow and ice and brought single-degree temperatures.
Extreme energy demand and overloaded frozen utility plants are among the factors that led to the power outages, experts said.

"Former Vice President Mike Pence is beginning to reemerge after the end of the Trump administration with the launch of a new group to counter the policies of the Biden administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress.
The former vice president has mostly kept out of public view since Inauguration Day, focusing mostly on some early work with conservative organizations and the arrival of a new grandchild. But on Wednesday, he launched Advancing American Freedom, an entity, he said in a statement, that would ""promote the pro-freedom policies of the last four..."
"President Barack Obama spoke separately Friday with Speaker John Boehner and the top Senate Democrat to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year, after Republican disarray in the U.S. House put the negotiations in limbo.
In a previously unscheduled statement to reporters, Obama outlined a possible agreement that he said would include protecting middle-class Americans from a tax hike, extending unemployment benefits and setting a framework for future deficit reduction steps.
He called on Congress to pass the agreement after a Christmas break..."
"President Barack Obamas stiffening resolve during the fight over the fiscal cliff can be traced directly to the lessons he drew from his hard-won triumph of the 2012 campaign.
He whipped Republicans a second time, parried the best attacks they could muster, and is now demanding that they respect the victory, if not the man who won it. That doesnt mean Obama wont eventually compromise, especially with the specter of a renewed recession lingering just over the horizon, but his body language is a lot more combative than the..."
"The chairman of the House Oversight Committee issued a stark warning Friday to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, demanding that the White House turn over documents and comply with interviews related to how the White House handled security clearances of some of the President's closest advisers.

"President Trump said Tuesday that a new trade deal with China might not come until after the 2020 elections, a significant departure from more than a year of trying to exert pressure on the world’s second-largest economy.
His comments were the latest in rapidly evolving, and sometimes contradictory, strategic shifts. Less than two months ago, he announced that a huge crackdown against China was imminent. On Tuesday, he suggested that further action could be more than a year away, and everything could change based on whether he is reelected.

"President Donald Trump lashed out at China for what he said is its unwillingness to buy American agricultural products and said it continues to “rip off” the U.S., just as the two nations resumed negotiations in Shanghai following a three-month breakup.
“China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 -- was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now -- no signs that they are doing so,” Trump said Tuesday on Twitter. “That is the problem with China, they just don’t come through.”"

"SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) — Frustration and anger mounted across Northern California as the state’s biggest utility began another round of fire-prevention blackouts Tuesday that could leave millions of people without electricity, some for five days or longer.
The shut-offs, aimed at keeping windblown electrical equipment from sparking wildfires, came as fire crews raced to contain two major blazes in Northern and Southern California before the winds picked up again. The fires have destroyed dozens of homes in Los Angeles and in Sonoma County wine country."
"Congressional negotiators had no agreements to report Saturday, but they issued positive reports on their talks to end a partial government shutdown and avert a default on government debt.

"Senate leaders began negotiations Saturday aimed at reopening federal agencies and avoiding a government default after every other effort to end Congress’s impasse crumbled in the previous 48 hours.
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) took over the talks, which had led nowhere in recent days. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) acknowledged early Saturday that his discussions with President Obama had collapsed and that the Senate was the last hope to avert a financial disaster."
"House Speaker John A. Boehner on Sunday defiantly rejected calls to reopen the government and raise the federal debt limit, warning that the nation is headed for a first-ever default unless President Obama starts negotiating with Republicans.
“That’s the path we’re on,” Boehner (R-Ohio) said on ABC’s “This Week.” Of Obama, he added: “He knows what my phone number is. All he has to do is call.”"
"After weeks of near silence without any hint of a potential compromise between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans over the thorny issue of raising the nation's debt ceiling, the White House may be offering some conciliatory language that could lead to a deal to prevent a potential default on Oct. 17.
As of last Friday, White House officials declined to specify any demand as to the length of a debt ceiling increase."
"The smear campaign against Kristen Welker—who is moderating Thursday’s second and final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden—began last Saturday with a hit piece by Trump-friendly New York Post reporter Jon Levine.
“Kristen Welker, upcoming presidential debate moderator, has deep Democrat ties,” screamed the headline, while Levine insinuated that the longtime NBC White House correspondent, a registered independent, must not only embrace the same politics as her parents—generous donors to Democratic causes and candidates—but that she also allows her parents’ beliefs to steer her journalism."

"President Biden’s announcement of a deal to help Australia deploy nuclear-powered submarines has strained the Western alliance, infuriating France and foreshadowing how the conflicting American and European responses to confrontation with China may redraw the global strategic map.
In announcing the deal on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said it was meant to reinforce alliances and update them as strategic priorities shift. But in drawing a Pacific ally closer to meet the China challenge, he appears to have alienated an important European one and aggravated already tense relations with Beijing.
France on Thursday reacted with outrage to the announcements that the..."

But over the weekend, Trump urged the Senate simply to dismiss the charges against..."

"Donald Trump's more sedate debate performance on Thursday night was a departure in tone from his chaotic performance weeks ago, but the President continued to cast his warped view of the world as truth.

Justice Jackson, 51, was confirmed in April, when the Senate voted 53 to 47 on her nomination. She is replacing Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 83, who stepped down with the conclusion of the court’s current term."
"The nation’s top public health official acknowledged Wednesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had failed to respond effectively to the coronavirus pandemic, and committed to extensive changes, including faster release of scientific findings and easier-to-understand guidance.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told senior leaders that she had embraced a long-awaited revamp of CDC culture based on an internal review that called for a more nimble and better-trained workforce and changing incentives to reward action over publication, among other things.
“For 75 years, CDC and public health have been..."
"President Trump and the physicians advising the federal pandemic response on Tuesday delivered a bleak outlook for the novel coronavirus’s spread across the country, predicting a best-case scenario of 100,000 to 240,000 fatalities in the United States and summoning all Americans to make additional sacrifices to slow the spread.
Trump adopted a newly somber and sedate tone — and contradicted many of his own previous assessments of the virus — as he instructed Americans to continue social distancing, school closures and other mitigation efforts for an additional 30 days and..."
"By invading ukraine, Vladimir Putin will destroy the lives of people far from the battlefield—and on a scale even he may regret. The war is battering a global food system weakened by covid-19, climate change and an energy shock. Ukraine’s exports of grain and oilseeds have mostly stopped and Russia’s are threatened. Together, the two countries supply 12% of traded calories. Wheat prices, up 53% since the start of the year, jumped a further 6% on May 16th, after India said it would suspend exports because of an alarming heatwave.
The widely accepted idea of a cost-of-living..."
"New York (CNN Business)Credit reporting agency Equifax has reached a deal to pay up to $700 million to state and federal regulators to settle probes stemming from a data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 150 million people. It will be the largest settlement ever paid for a data breach.
The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday that Equifax will pay at least $300 million and as much as $425 million to compensate affected people with credit monitoring services. That money will go into a fund that will also..."
"Americans will now get compensation for losses tied to one of the biggest data security failures ever.
Credit-reporting company Equifax has agreed to pick up the tab in a proposed deal with the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 50 states and territories to settle allegations that it did not implement sufficient security measures to protect its network. The settlement still must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.
The deal calls for Equifax to pay at least $575 million, including $300..."
"In the hours after Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to various crimes on Tuesday, his attorney Lanny Davis appeared on a number of television shows and granted other interviews centered on a common theme: Cohen has information that could be of interest to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III."
"President Joe Biden is planning the first major federal tax hike since 1993 to help pay for the long-term economic program designed as a follow-up to his pandemic-relief bill, according to people familiar with the matter.
Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won’t rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it’s been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will..."
"President Joe Biden is preparing to include a federal tax increase in his next big economic package, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday.
People familiar with the matter told the outlet that the Biden administration is working on a follow-up spending bill to the recently-enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus. The initiative is expected to have a bigger price-tag, and may raise the corporate tax rate and the income tax rate for high-earning individuals to offset the spending, Bloomberg reported.
The move would represent the first major federal tax..."
"In a highly anticipated announcement, Pfizer said on Monday a Phase 2/3 trial showed its Covid-19 vaccine was safe and generated a ""robust"" antibody response in children ages 5 to 11.
These are the first such results released for this age group for a US Covid-19 vaccine, and the data has not yet been peer-reviewed or published. Pfizer said it plans to submit to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization soon. FDA officials have said that once data is submitted, the agency could authorize a vaccine..."
"The consequences of the Senate impeachment trial that opens Tuesday could be considerable for former President Donald Trump.
And for almost everybody else.
Trump, accustomed to earning the word ""unprecedented"" while he was in office over the past four years, will do it again out of office – the first president to be impeached twice, and the first to face that historic rebuke even after he had moved out of the White House. That's not the sort of distinction presidents typically aspire to have.
But the stakes have the..."
"The U.S. Senate is a day away from starting former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial with many of the details still to be ironed out even as the outcome -- an acquittal -- is all but assured.
“We have no agenda, we have no rules, we’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting,” said David Schoen, one of the lawyers representing Trump in the trial. “We’re planning as well as we can based on the briefs in the case, but we don’t know how it’s going to proceed at all.”
Trump’s defense..."
"A soft murmur of familiarity rippled through the packed GOP convention hall Tuesday night when Mitt Romney's wife, Ann, spoke not of their ""storybook marriage"" but of one touched by cancer, multiple sclerosis and the trials of raising five sometimes screaming children.
""A storybook marriage? Not at all,"" she said, during her much anticipated prime-time speech. ""What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage."""
"Mark T. Esper, who served Donald Trump as defense secretary, alleges in a new book that he witnessed the former president in the Oval Office suggesting that members of the military should shoot protesters “in the legs or something.” Esper suggests others were present during that meeting.
Trump denies it. He says those witnesses present would back him up.
As it turns out, this is something that Congress might investigate and try to settle, one way or the other. Will Democrats act?
The key revelation, which Esper detailed in an interview on CBS News on..."
"President Biden called on Congress on Wednesday to temporarily suspend the federal gas tax, an effort to dampen the soaring fuel prices that have stoked frustration across the United States.
During a speech on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden asked Congress to lift the federal taxes — about 18 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24 cents per gallon of diesel — through the end of September, just before the fall midterm elections. The president also asked states to suspend their own gas taxes, hoping to alleviate the economic pain that has..."
"Bernie Sanders has turned months of private grumbling into public accusations that the party establishment is doing everything in its power to elect Hillary Clinton president.
He’s not the first to level that charge. In fact, he’s late to that party. But by twisting his breach of Clinton’s voter files into an indictment of the Democratic Party for temporarily cutting him off from his own data, the underdog has the fight his team has been eager to wage.
Indeed, his campaign says as much.
“In an outsider..."
"The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee on Friday, arguing that the party had unfairly suspended the campaign’s access to key voter information. After several tense hours, both sides announced a deal had been reached.
The suit came shortly after campaign manager Jeff Weaver acknowledged at a Washington news conference that Sanders staffers had improperly reviewed information gathered by rival Hillary Clinton earlier in the week. But he accused the DNC of over­reacting to the breach by suspending the Sanders..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump won impeachment acquittal in the U.S. Senate, bringing to a close only the third presidential trial in American history with votes that split the country, tested civic norms and fed the tumultuous 2020 race for the White House.
With Chief Justice John Roberts presiding, senators sworn to do “impartial justice” stood and stated their votes for the roll call — “guilty” or “not guilty” — in a swift tally almost exclusively along party lines. Trump, the chief justice then declared, shall “be, and is..."
"President Trump was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate of charges that he abused the powers of his office and obstructed Congress as it probed his attempts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations — capping a tumultuous, three-week impeachment trial that leaves his fate in the hands of voters in November.
Democrats fell far short of the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office, as senators voted 52 to 48 to acquit him on the abuse-of-power allegation and 53 to 47 to clear him of obstruction.
The outcome represented..."
"The Justice Department on Thursday said it would go back to executing federal death-row inmates for the first time in nearly two decades—a move capital punishment opponents quickly denounced as a step backward for criminal justice reform in the country.
“It’s distressing,” said Madeline Cohen, a capital defense attorney who represents three inmates on federal death row. “This administration has a history of taking rash actions, and this one is no exception.”
The federal government set execution dates as early as December for five convicted child murderers, including a man..."
"The question to Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1988, was brutally personal.
“If Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” Bernard Shaw, a CNN anchor, asked, referring to the Massachusetts governor’s wife. Dukakis said he wouldn’t favor it because “I don’t see any evidence that it is a deterrent.”
The technocratic, largely emotionless response in a debate mere weeks before the election marked the nadir of Democrats’ politically agonized relationship to the death penalty — reinforcing in some voters’..."
"The Trump administration's expedited removal program has scored its second court victory this week.
On Tuesday, a Washington, D.C. federal appeals court ruled the Trump administration could expand expedited removal, which allows for the fast-tracked deportation of undocumented immigrants without a lengthy court hearing. And on Thursday, the Supreme Court weighed in, ruling 7-2 to bar undocumented immigrants from challenging their expedited deportation in federal court.
For the past 24 years, expedited removal has let immigration officials apprehend undocumented people found within 100 miles of a U.S. border, within 14..."
"In a win for the Department of Homeland Security, the Supreme Court said Thursday that a Sri Lankan farmer who lost his bid for asylum in the United States after immigration officials ordered his removal could not challenge that decision in federal court.
The ruling will keep courthouse doors closed to asylum seekers in expedited removal processes who say they cannot return home because they have a credible fear of torture or even death.
The ruling is a win for the Trump administration, which has attempted to dramatically limit who's..."
"Harry M. Reid, a Nevada Democrat who rose from a hardscrabble mining town to become one of the longest-serving Senate majority leaders in history and a political force during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, died Dec. 28 at his home in Henderson, Nev. He was 82.
The death was confirmed by David Krone, a former chief of staff. Mr. Reid was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2018.
A combative but soft-spoken former amateur boxer, Mr. Reid displayed an economy of personal magnetism and embraced the art of..."
"Top police leaders in New York’s third-largest city are retiring en masse amid criticism of the city’s handling of the suffocation death of Daniel Prude, the mayor of Rochester said Tuesday.
La’Ron Singletary, the city’s police chief, is among those retiring, as is Deputy Chief Joseph M. Morabito and possibly other senior commanders, Mayor Lovely Warren said.
Warren made the surprise announcement of the retirements at a City Council briefing being held online. Council members had expected the chief to appear in person to discuss ongoing protests over the death..."
"The police chief of Rochester, N.Y., and several of his department’s highest ranking officials resigned on Tuesday in the aftermath of the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who suffocated after he had been placed in a hood by city police officers and pinned to the ground.
The resignations of the police chief, La’Ron D. Singletary, the deputy chief, Joseph Morabito, and, according to Mayor Lovely Warren, others in the department, came three days after the state attorney general, Letitia James, announced that she would impanel a grand jury..."
House Democrats are aggressively urging members to oppose a GOP-authored bill to address the border crisis. And with Republican senators voicing opposition of their own -- both to the House bill and to a Senate Democratic alternative -- it appears increasingly unlikely that Congress will send a border bill to the president's desk before leaving for the August recess.
"The House on Wednesday approved legislation 420-5 to drastically reform the Department of Veterans Affairs.
In a strong bipartisan vote, lawmakers backed the $17 billion compromise bill crafted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.). The Senate is expected to sign off on the legislation later this week."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation.
The 5-4 ruling was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.
In penning the opinion, Roberts once again sided with the liberals on the bench in a momentous dispute that will infuriate judicial conservatives who are still bitter that he..."
"President Joe Biden made no mention of gun control in the aftermath of last week's shootings in Atlanta -- including during remarks after visiting the city -- but he will face more pressure now to voice an opinion on the matter after another mass killing in Colorado.
Biden is expected to be briefed again Tuesday morning on the deadly shooting, two White House officials said, and plans to comment on the shooting at some point later in the day. He was planning to travel to Ohio to promote the anniversary..."
"Russian intelligence officials made repeated contact with members of President Trump's campaign staff, according to new reports that cite anonymous U.S. officials. American agencies were concerned about the contacts but haven't seen proof of collusion between the campaign and the Russian security apparatus, the reports say."
"The largely peaceful protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd went on across the US and around the world over the weekend, as it emerged that more than 10,000 US protesters have been arrested during the weeks of unrest – many for non-violent offences. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died, the city council has taken a dramatic step towards reform, by declaring their intent to disband the city’s police force and replace it with an alternative system of “public safety”.
The Obama administration introduced or stepped up measures to..."
"I stood at the back of the Cathedral at 1:30 on Christmas morning, shaking hands with the midnight worshippers on their way home. I had been preaching about God coming into our lives at Christmastime, especially in the form of the weak, the vulnerable and the homeless.
Most of the congregation were happy, but one man had something to get off his chest. “You should stick to the script!” he said to me. “Christmas has nothing to do with asylum-seekers!” And off he marched before I could splutter out the..."
"Christmas is (finally) upon us. After months of red-and-green evergreen decorations in every store, and an increasingly unbroken stream of Santa-centric pop songs in every public place, the annual American onslaught reaches its peak this week.
Every year, those of us who don’t celebrate Christmas find ourselves having the same debates over and over again, starting well before Thanksgiving and continuing into the New Year. Well-meaning friends, neighbors, and colleagues insist to us that we should not be bothered by the giant Christmas trees in every building lobby, or the..."
"The Washington Post, The New York Times, and NBC News on Saturday issued significant corrections, retracting earlier reporting that said Rudy Giuliani had been directly warned by the FBI that he was the target of a Russian disinformation campaign.
The stories came out after Giuliani's office and residence were raided by the FBI on Thursday. The searches were linked to a criminal probe of the former mayor's business dealings in Ukraine and resulted in the seizure of several communications devices.
""An earlier version of this story, published Thursday, incorrectly..."
"In the next two and half months, Joe Biden needs to build a governing team to help him tackle an historic pandemic and rebuild the economy — all while winning approval from what's likely to be a Republican-controlled Senate and holding together an unruly coalition of Democrats.
It's a task that will be nearly impossible to pull off.
The Biden transition team has been vetting potential candidates for months and will present the president-elect with potential choices in the coming days. Biden is expected to focus first on posts involving..."
"Consumer prices leapt higher in April, data released on Wednesday showed, a much-faster-than-expected jump that could resonate on Wall Street as investors try to determine if inflation could alter Federal Reserve policy.
The Consumer Price Index climbed 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the Labor Department said, the fastest pace since 2008. From March to April, prices increased 0.8 percent. Economists had expected the C.P.I. to rise 3.6 percent over the year, and 0.2 percent from the month before, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.

"Admitting a degree of fault for the first time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday that his administration’s lack of transparency about the scope of coronavirus-related deaths in nursing homes in New York was a mistake.
By failing to answer questions from state lawmakers, the public and the news media, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged, the state created a void that was “filled with skepticism, and cynicism, and conspiracy theories which furthered the confusion.”
But he stopped short of a full apology for his handling of information about the death toll..."
"President Trump fired him (after he submitted his resignation) and earlier this week reportedly called him ""the world's most overrated general,"" but former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had a few barbs of his own to sling in a speech he gave in New York on Thursday.
Delivering the keynote address at the 74th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Mattis — a retired four-star U.S. Marine general — said he felt he had finally ""achieved greatness.""
""I'm not just an overrated general, I am the greatest, the world's most overrated,""..."

"The World Health Organization called on Wednesday for a moratorium on coronavirus vaccine booster shots until the end of September, so that vaccine supplies can be focused on helping all countries vaccinate at least 10 percent of their populations. The agency made its appeal to the world’s wealthiest nations to address the wide disparities in vaccination rates around the world.
“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the W.H.O., said in a briefing. “But we cannot — and we..."
"Moderna will file Monday for an emergency authorization of its coronavirus vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration, becoming the second company to do so.
The vaccine developer said it would simultaneously ask the European Medicines Agency for conditional approval.
The FDA filing would clear the way for the vaccine to be authorized for use in the United States within weeks. Moderna's application relies on a final analysis of its 30,000-person late-stage trial that showed the vaccine to have 94.1 percent efficacy, on par with the 94.5 percent reported in..."
"House Democrats are formally unveiling their resolution to impeach President Donald Trump on Monday, charging him with ""incitement of insurrection"" for his role in last week's riots at the US Capitol.
The single impeachment article, which will be introduced at 11 a.m. ET when the House gavels in Monday, points to Trump's repeated false claims that he won the election and his speech to the crowd on January 6 before pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol. It also cited Trump's call with the Georgia Republican secretary of state where the President..."
"Devin Nunes, a Republican congressman from California, said on Monday that he is suing Twitter, a GOP operative, and unnamed defendants behind parody accounts on the social network, for defamation and other claims, after those accounts insulted him on the platform.
In an appearance on Hannity, Nunes said he was suing Twitter in the first of many lawsuits he plans to file against technology companies for their bias against conservatives. That appearance came after Fox News reported that the congressman had filed a $250 million lawsuit ""in Virginia state court""..."
"A bipartisan group of senators tentatively reached an agreement with White House officials Wednesday on hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending for the nation’s infrastructure system, giving a significant boost toward one of President Biden’s biggest domestic policy ambitions.
Multiple senators leaving an evening negotiating session at the Capitol said the group — which included five Democrats, five Republicans and top White House officials — had reached a framework of a deal. They said senators would go to the White House on Thursday to brief Biden personally on..."
"A federal appeals court in Manhattan says President Trump cannot block critics from his Twitter account, calling it ""unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.""
In a 29-page ruling on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's decision that found that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked certain Twitter users, because he uses his Twitter account ""to conduct official business and to interact with the public."" By preventing critics from accessing his feed, the president is barring them from participating in what..."
"A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that President Trump violated the 1st Amendment by blocking some critics from access to his Twitter feed. The decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals might seem like poetic justice visited on a president who can dish it out but can’t take it. But as a matter of constitutional law, the ruling isn’t persuasive.
In 2017, a group of Twitter users who had been blocked from seeing and responding directly to Trump’s tweets filed suit in federal court in New York...."
"When Jeb Bush stepped up onto the fabled soapbox at the Iowa State Fair on Friday, fairgoers pelted him with questions about the legacy of His Brother, a former president. And his father, another former president. And one of His foreign policy advisers, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the architect of His Brother's war in Iraq. And about the war itself.
Under a blazing sun, Bush Expressed irritation With what I have called ""the parlor game"" of focusing on past Wolfowitz and other Bush administration advisers Who Have resurfaced for esta Bush..."
"By bulldozing into Roger Stone's sentencing, Donald Trump sparked a mutiny by four career prosecutors, raised fears about the impartial administration of justice and showed how his impeachment acquittal unchained an already rampant presidency.
The Justice Department's decision to water down a recommendation by its own prosecutors for Stone to serve up to nine years in prison that outraged the President sent shockwaves through Washington. It also appears to reflect Trump's redoubled determination to escalate pressure on core institutions of the US government to pursue his personal and political priorities...."
"The former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a CNN clip on Friday that he favored a theory, decried by many scientists and rejected as “extremely unlikely” by at least one World Health Organization international expert, that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. The former official, Dr. Robert Redfield, offered no evidence and emphasized that it was his opinion.
“I am of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory,..."

The president also promoted the two nations’ close ties, particularly on..."
"The U.S. federal budget deficit widened in January to about five times the year-earlier level, reflecting spending on pandemic relief payments approved by Congress during the prior month.
The gap increased to $162.8 billion last month, from $32.6 billion in January 2020, according to a Treasury Department report Wednesday. In the first four months of the fiscal year that began in October, the deficit amounted to $735.7 billion -- a record for the period -- compared with $389.2 billion a year earlier, before the coronavirus struck. The report, the first..."
"Texas lawmakers on Saturday finished drafting a bill that would impose a raft of new voting restrictions, setting up the likely passage of what would be among the most far-reaching laws in Republicans’ nationwide drive to overhaul elections systems and limit voting.
The bill would tighten what are already some of the country’s strictest voting laws, and it would specifically target balloting methods that were employed for the first time last year by Harris County, home to Houston.
In addition to banning drive-through voting and 24-hour voting, which were used by nearly..."
"The final version of the sweeping GOP elections bill, negotiated in private by two Republican leaders from the Texas House and Senate, was unveiled Saturday, setting up an intensely partisan showdown over a measure that now includes a longer list of new rules and restrictions.
With GOP majorities in both houses of the Legislature, however, there is little doubt about the ultimate fate of floor votes on Senate Bill 7, a measure Republicans insisted is needed to bolster flagging faith in the election system but Democrats blasted as a transparent attempt to make it harder..."
"WASHINGTON — The U.S. will begin shipping doses of the Covid-19 vaccine directly to retail pharmacies next week, as the Biden administration expands how and where Americans can get inoculated.
The initial shipment of 1 million doses will go to 6,500 stores starting Feb. 11, said Jeffrey Zients, the Biden administration’s Covid-19 coordinator.
States were left by the Trump administration to devise their own distribution plans and some opted to use retail pharmacies in their states to help administer the vaccine to certain groups, like health care workers.

"In 1980, the Boy Scouts learned that Eagle Scout Tim Curran was gay and rejected the 18-year-olds application to be an assistant Scoutmaster. For the next 17 years, Curran fought the organization he loved, arguing that the Scouts discrimination because of sexual orientation was unconstitutional. He got nowhere."
"Millions of retirees on Social Security will get a 5.9% boost in benefits for 2022. The biggest cost-of-living adjustment in 39 years follows a burst in inflation as the economy struggles to shake off the drag of the coronavirus pandemic.
The COLA, as it’s commonly called, amounts to $92 a month for the average retired worker, according to estimates released Wednesday by the Social Security Administration. That marks an abrupt break from a long lull in inflation that saw cost-of-living adjustments averaging just 1.65% a year over the past 10 years.

Livestreamed into the Capitol complex, Zelenskyy said the U.S. must sanction Russian lawmakers and block imports, and he showed a packed auditorium of lawmakers an emotional video of the destruction and devastation his country has suffered in the war...."
"A deeply divided Supreme Court nudged the nation toward broad recognition of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in rulings hailed by advocates as a ""joyous occasion"" -- but still left many questions unanswered.
Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, justices threw out part of a law that denied hundreds of federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California.

"Job openings remained at a historic high in May, more evidence that workers are in high demand as the economy bounces back from the pandemic.
Openings reached 9.2 million, according to the Labor Department, about what they were a month earlier. They're about 30% higher than they were in February 2020, right before the pandemic.
While the May numbers remain little changed since April, there were some declines in job openings in certain sectors such as real estate, warehouses and transportation. Other sectors, meanwhile, continue to face staffing shortages."
"Employers in the United States posted a record-high number of job openings for the second straight month, spotlighting persistent hiring challenges as a snapback in economic activity generates high demand for workers.

"The culture wars of Donald Trump’s America materialized into a battlefront near the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, for the so-called “#StoptheSteal” protest or “Million MAGA March.”
Galvanized by misinformation and fake news, more than 10,000 Trump supporters—including QAnon conspiracy theorists, far-right Proud Boys, militia members, online trolls, and religious zealots—traveled from around the country to claim that the election was “stolen” or “rigged” on behalf of Joe Biden.

"Some undocumented immigrants in the country are very happy tonight – about 4.3 million. But some 6 million are disappointed. President Obama’s announcement of a set of executive orders on immigration is a major step toward fixing the status of unauthorized immigrants. But, no doubt, the moment feels bittersweet. As an advocate told me tonight: “It’s a victory, but it’s a partial victory.”"
"The United States has reportedly carried out an airstrike in Syria against a structure belonging to what it said were Iran-backed militia, according to multiple news outlets that cited Pentagon officials.
The strike on Thursday comes after a series of recent rocket attacks against US targets in Iraq.
The strike was approved by Joe Biden, and carried out in order to damage the group’s ability to wage future attacks, according to officials who spoke anonymously with Reuters and Politico."
"The United States launched airstrikes in Syria on Thursday, targeting facilities near the Iraqi border used by Iranian-backed militia groups. The Pentagon said the strikes were retaliation for a rocket attack in Iraq earlier this month that killed one civilian contractor and wounded a U.S. service member and other coalition troops.
The airstrike was the first military action undertaken by the Biden administration, which in its first weeks has emphasized its intent to put more focus on the challenges posed by China, even as Mideast threats persist.

Excessive rainfall had doused the state capital and central Mississippi throughout August, and flooding of the Pearl River has created issues treating water at a Jackson plant, causing its pumps to fail, officials said.
Gov. Tate Reeves announced a state of emergency and warned residents to not drink the water Monday night as he said Jackson, where he also lives, did not have reliable running..."
"When news broke Tuesday that the Biden administration was going to relax the rules of certain student loan repayment plans, thereby forgiving federal loans for 40,000 borrowers and offering 3.6 million people credit toward paying off their balances, I thought of my close friends and students who’ve been knee-deep in education-related debt for almost their entire adult lives. Several of them have had to choose between buying a home and paying off their student loans (the loans have always won out). In more extreme cases, I’ve known people who chose to default on..."
"Even in the wake of something as dramatic as last week’s DC riots, so much of the speechifying and legislative maneuvering that takes place on any given day in the nation’s capital — even and especially during the era of Trump — is predictable and superficial. Representatives prance and preen. Senators fall in line behind the party elders. Sure, there are those who break ranks every now and then, but it seems rarely enough to matter to the overall outcome. And then there are legislators like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who..."
"A senior American diplomat who oversees Haiti policy has resigned, two U.S. officials said, submitting a letter to the State Department that excoriated the Biden administration’s “inhumane, counterproductive decision” to send Haitian migrants back to a country that has been wracked this summer by a deadly earthquake and political turmoil.
The diplomat, Daniel Foote, was appointed special envoy to Haiti in July, just weeks after President Jovenel Moïse was killed in his bedroom during a nighttime raid on his residence. Mr. Foote, a former ambassador to Zambia and acting assistant secretary for international narcotics and..."
"Regulators in Britain granted approval to the experimental drug molnupiravir from U.S. pharmaceutical giant Merck on Thursday, marking the first authorization from a public health body for an oral antiviral treatment for covid-19 in adults.
Experts have said that if widely authorized, the medicine could have huge potential to help fight the coronavirus pandemic: Pills are easier to take, manufacture and store, making them particularly useful in lower- to middle-income countries with weaker infrastructure and limited vaccine supplies.
“We will continue to move with both rigor and urgency to bring..."
"May 1 is an official public holiday in 66 countries, including most of Europe. Other than a couple of faith-based holidays and the start of the new year, there’s hardly a holiday that spans so many nations. With its roots in ancient agrarian celebrations of spring, the official public holiday on May 1 is International Workers Day, celebrating the extraordinary contributions of workers and the working class. In countries where it’s an official day off, and 100 other nations, it is often commemorated with marches, protests, or strikes."
"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Millions of workers worldwide marked international labor day on Friday trapped between hunger and fear — struggling without jobs or worried they don’t have enough protections against the coronavirus as more countries and states reopen for business.
Beijing’s Forbidden City, the imperial palace turned museum that is one of China’s biggest tourist attractions, started welcoming visitors again, and Bangladesh began reopening factories, as world leaders try to salvage their battered economies without causing a resurgence of the virus that has killed over 230,000 worldwide.

"The last two Democratic presidents -- Barack Obama and Bill Clinton -- are praising Beau Biden in the wake of his death from brain cancer.
Like his father -- Vice President Joe Biden -- Beau ""was a good, big-hearted, devoutly Catholic and deeply faithful man, who made a difference in the lives of all he touched -- and he lives on in their hearts,"" said a statement from President Obama."
"Perhaps no one in American politics has dealt with more personal tragedy than Vice President Joe Biden. Beau Biden, who died Saturday of brain cancer at the age of 46, is the second child of Biden to precede their father in death.
The vice president lost his 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, and his first wife, Neilia, the mother of Beau Biden, in a 1972 car crash. Biden has reflected on the tragedy and how he dealt with grief several times during his career in politics.
During his commencement address at Yale..."
"When Donald Trump held one of his boisterous rallies at the state fairgrounds this month, Bonnie and Randy Reynolds arrived two hours early to make sure they could snag seats. They bought “Make America Great Again” hats, put on campaign T-shirts and passed through a security checkpoint.
The West Des Moines couple, who have two grown children, had never been to a political event before. Bonnie works in a mailroom; Randy is a press operator. They don’t live paycheck to p"
"As President Donald Trump’s supporters massed outside the Capitol last week and sang the national anthem, a line of men wearing olive-drab helmets and body armor trudged purposefully up the marble stairs in a single-file line, each man holding the jacket collar of the one ahead.
The formation, known as “Ranger File,” is standard operating procedure for a combat team that is “stacking up” to breach a building — instantly recognizable to any U.S. soldier or Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a chilling sign that many..."
"President Donald Trump’s deportation force promise may be coming true.
Over the last five days, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted what they call an “enforcement surge” in the Los Angeles area, arresting more than 160 undocumented immigrants. Immigrants’ rights groups and lawyers told The Daily Beast that ICE also increased its enforcement acti"
"A new committee to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol would have 13 members and the power to subpoena witnesses, according to legislation released by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The House is expected to vote on the bill this week.
The effort comes after Senate Republicans blocked the formation of an independent, bipartisan commission to probe the attack, in which hundreds of former President Donald Trump’s supporters violently broke into the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.
The new, partisan House panel would have eight..."
"The number of births in the U.S. fell 4% in 2020, dropping to the lowest level since 1979 and continuing a multi-year trend of declining birth rates. That's according to a report published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.
The agency reported 3,605,201 births in 2020, down from 3,747,540 during the year prior, based on provisional data from more than 99% of birth certificates issued during the year. 2020 marks the sixth consecutive year that the number of births in the..."
"The number of babies born in the U.S. dropped by 4% in 2020 compared with the previous year, according to a new federal report released Wednesday. The general fertility rate was 55.8 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, reaching yet another record low, according to the provisional data.

"A razor-thin margin, a slow vote count and a presidential election hanging in the balance have created the perfect storm for misinformation in Wisconsin.
The morning after the election, social media generated an avalanche of claims about Wisconsin voting totals, timing and turnout. Much of it isn’t true.
We’re separating fact from fiction on some of the most widely shared claims.

"President-elect Joe Biden and incoming first lady Jill Biden received initial injections of the coronavirus vaccine on Monday in a show of support for the inoculation.

"The trouble in Orange County Public Schools began, perhaps unsurprisingly, at a seminar called “Camp Legal.”
The meeting’s stated purpose was for the district’s attorneys to walk school administrators through changes to law, a part of their annual training. But Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act, better known as the “Don’t Say Gay” law, was due to take effect the following week, and neither the state nor the district had offered formal guidance on what that new law would actually mean for their classrooms — a problem, since summer school..."
"Just weeks before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller after his death in August. It reveals that Hofeller “played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural..."
"The Trump administration wants the 2020 census, which will be distributed to all people living in the United States next spring, to ask, “Are you a citizen of the United States?” A group of blue states led by California and New York emphatically do not want a census citizenship question, because they’re worried it will make their residents less likely to return their census forms — and thus hurt their apportionment in Congress after the 2020 census results are tallied.
On Tuesday at 10 am Eastern time, the Supreme Court..."
"Many Democratic leaders, operatives and officials are cautiously warming to the idea of President Joe Biden running for reelection in 2024, dozens of high-ranking Democrats told CNN.
But just like many voters and donors – as poll after poll shows – they’re still not sure he should do it, or that he will.
The mood has notably shifted among top Democrats in recent months. During the depths of Biden’s political struggles in March, some party leaders from all over the country huddled in the hallways of the Hilton a few..."

""During two and a half years of reporting, I made a dozen requests both in writing and in person to speak with Roger Ailes about every aspect of my book, The Loudest Voice in the Room,"" Sherman told POLITICO in a statement. ""A team of two fact-checkers spent more than 2,000 hours vetting the manuscript..."
"Roger Ailes was so eager to influence national politics that in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, he told fellow Fox News executives point-blank: “I want to elect the next president.”
In the corporate thicket of News Corporation, according to a new book, Mr. Ailes dared to battle with Lachlan Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman, openly gloating when the younger Mr. Murdoch eventually left his post at the company and even commandeering his chair.
At Fox News, the book says, Mr. Ailes was disdainful of even..."

"NEW YORK (AP) — Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who once sparred with journalists, has decided to join them.
Fox News said Thursday that Sanders has been hired to provide political commentary and analysis across all its properties, including Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and the radio and podcast division.
Sanders was press secretary for President Donald Trump from July 2017 through June 2019, quarreling with reporters who aggressively questioned her about any number of controversies involving the president.

"Brazilian police and protesters clashed in Sao Paulo on Thursday just hours before the opening game of the World Cup, which has been marred by construction delays and months of political unrest.
Police fired tear gas and noise bombs to disperse more than 100 demonstrators angry about heavy government spending on the event, a spokesman for Sao Paulo state's military police said."
"A colorful and noisy protest of about 500 people turned violent when police used canisters of tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators in the Lapa neighborhood Thursday, hours before the first World Cup game in Sao Paulo.
Many protesters came prepared with gas masks, helmets and spray bottles to clean their faces after pepper spay was used."
"While Washington – and political Twitter – remain consumed by the battle of words between President Trump and Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, not to mention the latest attempts by the Republicans to move tax reform forward, an important Republican effort to weaken financial oversight and accountability is proceeding onward behind the scenes."
Why would Trump randomly begin his morning by launching a sudden attack on transgender Americans whom he pledged repeatedly to fight for on the campaign trail? Perhaps because he thought they were standing between him and the thing he wants more than anything in the world: funding for his precious border wall.
"In the year after he disclosed a federal investigation into his “tax affairs” in late 2020, President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, paid off a significant tax liability, even as a grand jury continued to gather evidence in a wide-ranging examination of his international business dealings, according to people familiar with the case.
Mr. Biden’s failure to pay all his taxes has been a focus of the ongoing Justice Department investigation. While wiping out his liability does not preclude criminal charges against him, the payment could make it harder for prosecutors to win..."
"Chairman Bennie Thompson opened Thursday’s prime-time hearing of the Jan. 6 committee saying Donald Trump as president did “everything in his power to overturn the election” he lost to Joe Biden, including before and during the deadly Capitol attack.
“He lied, he bullied, he betrayed his oath,” charged Thompson, D-Miss.
After months of work and weeks of hearings, committee co-chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming said “the dam has begun to break” on revealing what happened that day, at the White House as well as in the violence at the Capitol.

"Both Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers signed affidavits late Wednesday saying they want to rescind their votes to certify the county's election results.
It is not clear what effect, if any, the affidavits have.
""It means absolutely nothing,"" said Jonathan Kinloch, a Democratic member of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, who said the affidavits are a ploy to be used in an existing or future lawsuit.
Kinloch said the board even approved a second motion waiving reconsideration of the certification. ""We had a definite deadline..."

It’s the first defamation suit filed against a media outlet by the voting company, which was a target of misleading, false and bizarre claims spread by President Donald Trump and his allies in the aftermath of Trump’s election loss to Joe Biden. Those claims helped spur on rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol..."
"Dominion Voting Systems on Friday filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, alleging that the network purposefully aired false claims about the the company’s role in the 2020 presidential election in order to boost ratings.
In the suit, filed in a Delaware court, Dominion argued that the Fox and several of its on-air personalities elevated conspiracy theories about the voting company rigging the 2020 election and allowed falsehoods by their guests to go unchecked, including a wild claim that the company’s machines were manufactured in “Venezuela to rig..."

"Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, the animated and occasionally irascible Democrat from Maryland who rose from being a community organizer to become the longest-serving woman in Congress, announced on Monday that she would retire when her term ends in 2017.
The surprising decision came just a few months after Republicans gained control of the Senate, reducing Ms. Mikulski from chairwoman to of the powerful Appropriations Committee, where she had been the first woman to lead the panel, to ranking member.
Ms. Mikulski, 78, announced her decision to not seek a sixth..."
"Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, conceded on Monday that he could not stave off final passage of a resolution overturning President Trump’s national emergency declaration, setting up a rebuke to Mr. Trump amid signs that the president’s grip even on his own party in Congress may be slipping.

That way she can watch patients leave after their abortions, and absorb the palpable sense of relief in the clinic’s hallways. “Being able to see them before the procedure, after the procedure, and just have them say how grateful they are that they were able to make it in when they did, that just can make all the difference in the world,” Pittman says. “Aside from the..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court appeared divided in its first major abortion case of the Trump era, leaving Chief Justice John Roberts as the likely deciding vote.
Roberts did not say enough to tip his hand in an hour of spirited arguments at the high court Wednesday.
The court’s election-year look at a Louisiana dispute could reveal how willing the more conservative court is to roll back abortion rights. A decision should come by late June.
The outcome could have huge consequences at a time when several states have..."
"The governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, is considering using the national guard and out-of-state medical workers to fill hospital staffing shortages, as tens of thousands of workers are unlikely to meet a Monday deadline for mandated Covid-19 vaccination.
The plan, outlined in a statement, would allow the governor to declare a state of emergency and thereby increase the supply of healthcare workers to include licensed professionals from other states and countries as well as retired nurses.
Hochul said the state was also looking at using national guard officers with medical training to..."

Lindsey Graham said he believes capping tax deductions should be part of a plan to reduce the federal debt - a revenue-raising tactic that pushes against Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which stipulates lawmakers who sign the document will ""oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."""
"Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday revoked Disney’s special tax privileges in Florida, culminating an extraordinary clash between one of the Republican Party’s leading figures and a powerful company with deep historical ties in his state.
The move, which reverses a 55-year arrangement allowing the company to self-govern its theme park complex, came after a weekslong battle with Disney that became a symbol of the country’s broader cultural fights over education, sexuality and identity."
"Joe Biden on Monday appeared to boost his goal for coronavirus vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, suggesting that the nation could soon be vaccinating 1.5 million Americans on average per day.
Biden signaled his increasing bullishness on the pace of vaccinations after signing an executive order to boost government purchases from US manufacturers.

"Election officials in the presidential battleground state of Pennsylvania must accept mail ballots that arrive up to three days after the election under an order issued Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The ruling was a defeat for Republicans who said counting late ballots would inject chaos into an already complicated general election.

"The cease-fire between Hamas and Israel has been a political boost for Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. The Islamist leader spent hours in meetings and on the phone with world leaders, including President Obama, and got results: a cessation of violence that puts Egypt back on the international map. But Morsi faces a test Thursday night, when negotiations on the details begin."

“Omicron is here, and it looks like it’s very transmissible,” he said..."
"President Joe Biden is expected to order an end to American support for offensive operations in Yemen in his first visit to the State Department on Thursday, part of the new leader's effort to reverse the foreign policy posture of his predecessor.
Former President Donald Trump, who frequently touted an ""America First"" approach to interacting with the world, vetoed a bipartisan resolution in 2019 calling on the U.S. to end involvement in Yemen. Trump's decision was largely seen as an effort to side with Saudi Arabia, who the former president..."
"A federal judge rejected former President Donald Trump’s request to block the release of documents to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
In denying a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said Tuesday that Congress had a strong public interest in obtaining records that could shed light on a violent insurrection mounted by the former president’s supporters. She added that President Joe Biden had the authority to waive executive privilege over the documents despite Trump’s assertions otherwise.

"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been rising through the Democratic primary race, most likely because of the absolutely massive amount of money he's poured into it. And at a Chattanooga, Tennessee rally on Wednesday, the billionaire made it clear just what that money can do, Politico reports.
""In 2018, I helped flip the House"" by bankrolling 21 Democratic challengers who eventually won Republican-held seats, Bloomberg said Wednesday. That led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to return to her role at the top of the legislative body, and..."

"President Donald Trump said his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19 will be moved to the next day because of the Juneteenth observance and after criticism of the choice of date.
Juneteenth, which takes place on June 19, commemorates the day in 1865 on which enslaved people in Texas belatedly learned that slavery in the U.S. had been abolished. The date is not recognized as a federal holiday and is largely commemorated within the U.S. African American community."
"t’s a celebration of Black history and freedom that relatively few white Americans had heard of till recently, if at all. Now suddenly, Juneteenth is prominent on the nation’s calendar, propelled there by sweeping protests against racial injustice, a controversial decision by President Donald Trump in scheduling a campaign rally (later rescheduled) and the decision by some high-profile companies to make the day a holiday for all employees."

"Back in the early days of the Great Recession, there was a lot of foreign policy pundit panic that China would somehow use its holdings of American debt as an economic lever to force Washington to kowtow to Beijing. Also back in those early days, I argued that this was nonsense.

"If Roger Stone is dispatched to prison for years, President Donald Trump will commute his sentence or pardon him altogether.
The odds of that happening soared on Tuesday, the minute Trump commuted the sentence of Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor, and wiped clean with pardons the criminal records of some other high-profile people.
Trump does nothing for anybody that is not, at bottom, for himself. In this case, Blagojevich becomes the beneficiary."
"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich on Tuesday, one of several high-profile grants of clemency he issued as he ramped up his criticism of federal prosecutions.
Trump announced pardons for former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, rogue financier Michael Milken and former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., who pleaded guilty in a gambling fraud case in the late 1990s. The president said he has not decided what to do with convicted allies Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and..."

"President Donald Trump pitched a bottom-line reelection campaign message on Thursday night: He was dealt some bad cards and needed more time to get things fixed.
Speaking at his first town hall of 2020, a Fox News event in Scranton, Pa., Trump contrasted his acts as president with those of his predecessor, while complaining that a barrage of Democratic accusations about his conduct had hindered him from fulfilling his entire agenda."
"The Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to a record on Monday, joining other market gauges at all-time highs, as the stock market’s rally carried into a fifth week.
Oil producers, banks and other stocks that do well when the economy is strengthening again led the way. It’s a notable shift in leadership following months of struggles for what Wall Street calls “cyclical” stocks, which lagged due to worries about trade wars and the slowing global economy.
Behind the resurgence for cyclicals are rising hopes that the United States and China..."
"The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it is allowing hearing aids to be made available over the counter without the need for costly medical exams or prescriptions.
The FDA’s move establishes a new category of over-the-counter hearing aids that can be sold directly to consumers. It only applies to hearing devices for adults with mild to moderate hearing problems, excluding devices for more severe hearing loss, which will still require a prescription. 
The action is intended to make hearing aids cheaper and more widely available to tens of millions of people..."
"Donald Trump has done it again. Less than 24 hours after President Barack Obama aimed to set the tone for the country on a response to the threat of terrorism with an Oval Office address, Trump only needed a press release to cause an uproar with his call for an outright ban on Muslims entering the United States."
"(CNN) -- Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson doesn't understand what the big deal is about sending children back to school in the fall.
""These kids have got to get back to school,"" Parson told a conservative talk radio host. ""They're at the lowest risk possible.

"The story is getting familiar: Donald J. Trump won the biggest contests of the night, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas captured the most conservative state up for grabs. Hillary Clinton kept a clear upper hand in the Democratic race, but Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proved he would not be driven away anytime soon."
"For the second time in two major legislative battles, the Trump White House has issued an ultimatum — only to back down. In the health care debate, the president was going to force a House vote on the package and dare skeptical Republicans to vote against replacing Obamacare, before abandoning that plan in the face of defeat.
And now, in the government funding debate, he's backing off his previous demand that Congress approve funding for his border wall. As The Post's Philip Rucker, Robert Costa and"

And in fact, recent polls in several swing states show Romney asserting a lead or closing the gap in a way he hadnt before."
"A diplomatic rift between Turkey and the United States was patched over late Saturday after the American vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., officially apologized to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for remarks suggesting that Turkey helped facilitate the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group.
In remarks at Harvard University on Thursday, Mr. Biden said Mr. Erdogan had admitted erring in allowing foreign fighters to cross Turkey’s border into Syria, eventually leading to the formation of the group, also known as ISIS and ISIL."
"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey for comments he made last week that Middle Eastern allies are partly to blame for the strengthening of ISIS.
The latest apology came in phone call from Biden to the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, representatives from both countries said Sunday. The vice president issued an apology to Turkey earlier during the weekend."
"President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months, a bid to control energy prices that have spiked after the United States and allies imposed steep sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
The president said it was not known how much gasoline prices could decline as a result of his move, but he suggested it might be “anything from 10 cents to 35 cents a gallon.” Gas is averaging about $4.23 a gallon, compared..."
"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday visited the Holocaust Museum and apologized for previously comparing coronavirus face-mask policies to the Nazi practice of labeling Jews with Star of David badges.
But the Georgia Republican declined to walk back other controversial statements she has made, including one in which she compared the Democratic Party to Hitler’s party, the National Socialist German Workers’ Party.
Greene’s latest remarks come days before a fellow House member, Rep. Bradley Schneider (D-Ill.), is set to introduce a resolution to censure her over the Holocaust comparison.

"The pace of evacuation flights out of Kabul accelerated today after a double suicide-bomb attack that killed 13 US troops and 72 Afghans – the deadliest day for US troops in more than a decade.
Joe Biden addressed the masterminds behind the attack in an update to the nation yesterday, telling them: “We will hunt you down and make you pay.”
The bombs – reportedly a car bomb and a suicide vest – detonated within minutes of each other at 6pm local time yesterday, one near Abbey gate and another near the Baron hotel...."
"Last year, racing to develop a vaccine in record time, Pfizer made a big decision: Unlike several rival manufacturers, which vowed to forgo profits on their shots during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pfizer planned to profit on its vaccine.
On Tuesday, the company announced just how much money the shot is generating.
The vaccine brought in $3.5 billion in revenue in the first three months of this year, nearly a quarter of its total revenue, Pfizer reported. The vaccine was, far and away, Pfizer’s biggest source of revenue.
The company did..."
"Gun purchases are off limits in the U.S. to anyone who uses medical marijuana or holds a state-approved medicinal marijuana card, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, accepting the government’s view that illegal-drug users are prone to violence.
Although medical-marijuana use is legal in California, 24 other states and Washington, D.C., the federal government still bans all use of the drug, and in 1968 Congress prohibited illegal-drug users and addicts from buying and possessing firearms.
On Wednesday, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said..."
"This was the moment Joseph R. Biden Jr. had to know would be coming. He did not seem entirely prepared.
About an hour into the debate on Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris, a black former prosecutor from California, had edged into the cross-talk with a request: “I would like to speak on the issue of race.”
Soon, her precise intention was clear. She paused and took a breath. “I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden,” she said, turning toward the 2020 primary front-runner who waxed nostalgic earlier this..."
"Washington (CNN)Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Wednesday that he does not support using active duty troops to quell the large-scale protests across the United States triggered by the death of George Floyd and those forces should only be used in a law enforcement role as a last resort, directly contradicting President Donald Trump.

"The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a massive economic stimulus package of around $850 billion to stanch the economic free fall caused by the coronavirus, four officials familiar with the planning said Tuesday.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will present details to Senate Republicans later Tuesday. The package would be mostly devoted to flooding the economy with cash, through a payroll tax cut or other mechanism, two of the officials said, with some $50 billion directed specifically to helping the airline industry.
White House officials also want to include..."
"The US economy added 943,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% — a new low of the pandemic era — the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
It was the biggest job gain since August last year, when more than 1 million positions were added back, and more than the 870,000 economists had expected.
The June jobs gains was revised up as well, to 938,000 positions added, showing the recovery's strong pace over the summer.
Since May 2020, America has added back 16.7 million jobs. But it's still 5.7 million short of..."

The Department of Justice is expected Tuesday to charge Google with violating federal antitrust law, according to two people familiar with the matter, finding after a year-long investigation that the tech giant wrongfully wielded its digital dominance to the detriment of corporate rivals and consumers.
The federal government’s imminent lawsuit will touch off a landmark and lengthy legal war between Washington and..."
"Ghislaine Maxwell’s bound for a new social scene: federal prison.
A Manhattan jury found the wealthy one-time darling of New York and London’s high societies guilty Wednesday of enticing young sex abuse victims for Jeffrey Epstein.
The jurors in Manhattan Federal Court deliberated for 40 hours over five days before returning the verdict. The 60-year-old faces up to 65 years in prison when Judge Alison Nathan sentences her for aiding in a decade-long scheme to recruit and transport teenage girls worldwide for Epstein to sexually abuse.

"Donald Trump remains banned from Facebook Inc.’s global echo chamber, and that’s a good thing. After the social media company banned him in January for inciting a deadly insurrection at the Capitol, its Oversight Board — the outside group the company established to monitor controversial content and arbitrate thorny issues such as Trump’s exile — said Wednesday that his history of violence disqualified him for the time being.
“The Board found that, in maintaining an unfounded narrative of electoral fraud and persistent calls to action, Mr. Trump created an environment..."
It took very little time for the same-old deeply dangerous rhetoric to rear its ugly head after the publication of a report accusing Aziz Ansari of sexual misconduct. In the anonymous report—published over the weekend by Babe—a woman shares her account the alleged misconduct which took place on a date in September 2017.
"Forty-eight hours after a horrific mass shooting on the Fourth of July, President Biden flew to Ohio on Wednesday for a speech on pension plans.
With inflation soaring and Democrats still fuming about the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Mr. Biden’s public schedule included no events or announcements on either topic.
And in response to last week’s blockbuster testimony about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Biden has said almost nothing, pledging deference to the congressional committee investigating the violent assault on American democracy.

"Evidence of an unrelenting campaign of cyberstealing linked to the Chinese government is prompting the Obama administration to develop more aggressive responses to the theft of U.S. government data and corporate trade secrets.
The Obama administration is expected to announce new measures Wednesday, including possible fines and other trade actions against China or any other country guilty of cyber-espionage. Official"
"If the Chinese military is regularly hacking into the computers of U.S. organizations, as an American security firm says, it raises all sorts of questions about how the U.S. should respond.
Is this a job for the military or the intelligence agencies? What role should diplomats and trade officials be playing?
The report issued this week by the IT security consultancy Mandiant says it has traced the hacking activity to the People's Liberation Army's Unit 61398, which has ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations."""
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly half of Americans whose families experienced a layoff during the coronavirus pandemic now believe those jobs are lost forever, a new poll shows, a sign of increasing pessimism that would translate into roughly 10 million workers needing to find a new employer, if not a new occupation.
It’s a sharp change after initial optimism the jobs would return, as temporary cutbacks give way to shuttered businesses, bankruptcies and lasting payroll cuts. In April, 78% of those in households with a job loss thought they’d be temporary...."
"The level of new jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week, signaling a weakening trend in the labor market as states across the US grapple with a resurgence in coronavirus cases. Another 1.416 million Americans filed for first-time unemployment insurance benefits, up from just over 1.3 million the prior week, to mark the first increase in new claims on a week over week basis since March.
Here were the main results from the report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:"
"President Donald Trump on Wednesday moved to block Congress’ access to documents about how a citizenship question was added to the 2020 census.

But while repeatedly..."
"President Donald Trump said on Monday he is looking at four or five jurists to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court and he will announce his nominee on Friday or Saturday.
Trump pushed ahead with plans for his third U.S. Supreme Court nomination, which would cement a 6-3 conservative majority, as some Republicans wavered on whether to support the move weeks before an election.
The Republican president said in an interview with Fox News that he wanted to wait out of respect for Ginsburg, a..."
"Traditionally, the spouses of major-party nominees get a speaking slot at the national convention to humanize the candidate. Former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history. Bill Clinton falls into both categories, but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday night; he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again."

From Wednesday, the video streaming site, which has already banned Covid jab falsehoods, will take down content that contains misinformation such as claiming any approved vaccine is dangerous, causes chronic health defects or does not reduce spread of disease.
Under previous guidelines, the platform demoted – effectively hiding from view – videos that spread misinformation about non-Covid vaccines or promoted vaccine hesitancy.

The Labor Department released its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for February on Friday morning, providing one of the better snapshots of the state of the American economy.

"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a stark message Friday: The Fed will likely impose more large interest rate hikes in coming months and is resolutely focused on taming the highest inflation in four decades.
Powell also warned more explicitly than he has in the past that the Fed’s continued tightening of credit will cause pain for many households and businesses as its higher rates further slow the economy and potentially lead to job losses.
“These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation,” he said in a high-profile speech at the..."

Bryan said, ""The virus dies quickest in sunlight,"" leaving Trump to wonder whether you could bring the light ""inside..."

And so our individual income taxes are the ones I want to reform. Make them simpler. I want to bring the rates down. By the way, don't be expecting a huge cut in..."
"Polls show Mitt Romney trailing President Barack Obama in just about every one of the swing states where the 2012 campaign is being waged.
But Romney appears to be in deeper trouble in Ohio than elsewhere, an alarming development for Republicans who know that the candidate's White House chances begin and end with the kind of middle-class voters who reside in places such as Akron, Cincinnati and Zanesville.
So why exactly is Romney trailing?
Two surveys released in recent days, one from the Ohio Newspaper Association and..."
"More than half of Americans say there's an ""invasion"" at the southern border, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll, part of a broader decline in support for immigrants overall.
The poll also found that large numbers of Americans hold a variety of misconceptions about immigrants — greatly exaggerating their role in smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S., and how likely they are to use public benefits, for example — as false and misleading claims about immigration gain traction.
Republicans are more likely to hold negative views of immigrants. But the poll..."

If enacted, the legislation released Wednesday night in a surprise agreement between Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would represent one of the most consequential pieces of economic policy in recent U.S. history — though still far smaller than the $3 trillion the Biden administration initially sought."

"When Toni Morrison received her Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, her remarks began with a reflection on the phrase once upon a time. In her signature, measured cadence, Morrison told the Swedish Academy she believed these were some of the first words we remember from our childhoods.
Morrison, who was 88, died Monday night at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, according to her publisher, Penguin Random House. Morrison's family, in a statement released by the publisher, said she died ""following a short illness"" and surrounded by loved ones."

"Senior defense officials say Pentagon chief Leon Panetta is removing the military's ban on women serving in combat, opening hundreds of thousands of front-line positions and potentially elite commando jobs after more than a decade at war.
The groundbreaking move recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff overturns a 1994 rule prohibiting women from being assigned to smaller ground combat units. Panetta's decision gives the military services until January 2016 to seek special exceptions if they believe any positions must remain closed to women.
A senior military official says the..."
"Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find Donald Trump's campaign or associates conspired with Russia, Attorney General William Barr said Sunday.
Mueller's investigation of whether the President committed obstruction of justice did not conclude the President committed a crime, but it also ""does not exonerate him,"" Barr quoted from Mueller's report.

"In the U.S. departure from Afghanistan, China has seen the realization of long-held hopes for a reduction of the influence of a geopolitical rival in what it considers its backyard.
Yet, it is also deeply concerned that the very withdrawal could bring risk and instability to that backyard — Central Asia — and possibly even spill over their narrow, remote border into China itself and the heavily Muslim northwestern region of Xinjiang.
The Taliban’s takeover could certainly present political and economic opportunities for China, including developing Afghanistan’s vast mineral riches,..."
"The speed and scope of the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan have prompted introspection in the West over what went wrong, and how, after billions of dollars spent on a 20-year war effort, it could all end so ignominiously. China, though, is looking forward. It is ready to step into the void left by the hasty U.S. retreat to seize a golden opportunity.
While Beijing has yet to formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan’s new government, China issued a statement on Monday saying that it “respects the right of the Afghan people to..."

"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he refuses to describe the Islamic State and al Qaeda as groups fueled by ""radical Islam"" because the term grants them a religious legitimacy they don't deserve.

"The United States is hitting North Korea with a new set of economic sanctions after determining the country was behind last month's computer hack at Sony.
The White House said a new executive order targets leaders in North Korea's government, preventing them from accessing property and entering the United States. The isolated nuclear regime, which has denied involvement in the Sony hack, was already subject to a strict set of U.S. economic restrictions."
"The Obama administration doubled down on Friday on its allegation that North Korea’s leadership was behind the hacking of Sony Pictures, announcing new, if largely symbolic, economic sanctions against 10 senior North Korean officials and the intelligence agency it said was the source of “many of North Korea’s major cyberoperations.”
The actions were based on an executive order President Obama signed on vacation in Hawaii, as part of what he had promised would be a “proportional response” against the country. But in briefings for reporters, officials said they could not..."

"How do you solve a problem like Joe Manchin? This is the question angry Democrats have been asking themselves ever since the senator from West Virginia said it was time to take a “strategic pause” on plans to pass a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package.
The answer, unfortunately, is not much; there is little Democrats can do to persuade, pressure or punish Manchin. But that doesn’t mean Manchin holds all the cards. There’s only so far he can push back against the rest of the Democratic Party without harming himself."
"When a moderate goes against his party, the political media are drawn like moths to a flame. Such was the case with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) on Sunday, as he appeared on NBC’s, CNN’s and ABC’s Sunday talk shows to explain his opposition to the budget reconciliation bill at the center of President Biden’s legislative agenda.
The West Virginia senator came with plenty of rationalizations. He expressed concern about inflation and the national debt. (“Do we have the urgency to spend another $3.5 trillion right now?” he asked on CNN.)..."

"Hurricane Dorian was hitting the Virgin Islands on Wednesday, and was expected to slam into the island municipality of Culebra in Puerto Rico before moving into warm Atlantic waters, where it may strengthen into a major storm threatening the Southeastern United States.
The compact storm has been maddeningly difficult to forecast, as tends to be the case with smaller, disorganized systems.
The core of the storm, which reached hurricane strength shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time, is no longer expected to cross through Puerto Rico’s big island. Puerto Ricans had..."
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions engaged in highly contentious testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, with Democrats pressing him on his conversations with President Trump related to the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

"Classified assessments by American spy agencies over the summer painted an increasingly grim picture of the prospect of a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and warned of the rapid collapse of the Afghan military, even as President Biden and his advisers said publicly that was unlikely to happen as quickly, according to current and former American government officials.
By July, many intelligence reports grew more pessimistic, questioning whether any Afghan security forces would muster serious resistance and whether the government could hold on in Kabul, the capital. President Biden said on July 8 that the..."
"Every Fourth of July when I was a boy, the Jaycees sponsored a carnival at our local park, followed by a concert from the town’s volunteer band and a fireworks show. The water-balloon toss and the cotton candy machine were delightful, I suppose, but the attraction that galvanized every boy at the fair was the chance to lay down two bucks for the chance to swing a sledgehammer at an old car.
This was big money in those days. An hour and a half mowing and trimming a neighbor’s lawn..."

"President Barack Obama has always been a reluctant warrior. It is, in fact, one of the big reasons he was elected, since America had turned away from the cowboy swagger of Bush and Cheney by 2008. Tonight, President Obama laid out the case for escalating a war we've already begun, in Iraq and Syria. He presented his plan to the public, and gave his reasons for why America should become more involved in the fight against the Islamic State (or, variously, ISIS or ISIL), and explained what America would and..."

An updated warning will be added to the label.
The CDC and US Food and Drug Administration recommended pausing the use of the vaccine on April 13 while they investigated the risk of rare, severe blood clots. On Friday, members of the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices agreed the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks from rare blood clots linked with the vaccine."

"  President Biden traveled to Georgia on Tuesday to call on the Senate to do whatever is necessary, including changing the Senate’s filibuster rule, to protect voting rights and secure our democracy. He was eloquent and passionate, but soaring rhetoric isn’t likely to persuade the two Democratic holdouts whose votes will be necessary to sidestep the filibuster.
“The battle for the soul of America is not over,” he insisted. Directing his ire at the defeated former president and his supporters, Biden argued, “They want chaos to reign; we want the..."
"Millions of Americans between the ages of 12 and 15 can now get a booster shot of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, after the CDC formally adopted new recommendations backed by a majority of the agency's outside vaccine advisers. 
The CDC now says that Americans as young as 12 who received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine should receive a third dose as early as five months after their first two shots. The agency's officials said that enough time has passed for around 5 million adolescents to be eligible.
Currently, a little more than half of Americans in this age group..."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Wednesday to press ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, pushing back against calls from the United States to wind down the operation that has left hundreds dead.
Netanyahu’s tough comments marked the first public rift between the two close allies since the fighting began last week and could complicate international efforts to reach a cease-fire.
Israel continued to pound targets in Gaza with airstrikes, while Palestinian militants bombarded Israel with rocket fire throughout the day. In another sign of potential..."
"President-elect Donald Trump’s charitable foundation has admitted to the IRS that it violated a legal prohibition against “self-dealing,” which bars nonprofit leaders from using their charity’s money to help themselves, their businesses or their families.
That admission was contained in the Donald J. Trump Foundation’s IRS tax filings for 2015, which were recently posted online at the nonprofit-tracking site GuideStar. A GuideStar spokesman said the forms were uploaded by the Trump Foundation’s law firm, Morgan, Lewis and"
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday rejected calls from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to allow witnesses at an expected Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
""We don't create impeachments,"" he said in remarks prepared for delivery on the Senate floor. ""We judge them.""
""The House chose this road. It is their duty to investigate. It is their duty to meet the very high bar for undoing a national election,"" McConnell said. ""If they fail, they fail. It is not the Senate's job to leap into the breach..."
"At Wednesday's press conference, President Joe Biden was asked a simple question. It was this: ""Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn't passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?""
The easy answer -- and the one Biden's White House wishes he gave -- goes something like this: ""Yes, despite all of the Republicans' attempts to limit who can vote and when, I ultimately have faith in the American political system's ability to produce a free and fair election.""
He..."
"Republican Senate candidates Scott Brown and Cory Gardner on Monday embraced the notion that climate change is caused in part by human activity, despite previously expressing skepticism that man-made climate change is real.
Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, is seeking to unseat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, while Gardner, a congressman from Colorado, is looking to defeat Sen. Mark Udall in that state. Both Senate races, regarded as unexpectedly competitive for Democrats, had debates on Monday -- the first for New Hampshire candidates, the second for Colorado. In both,..."
"There's one American voter with particularly high stakes in whether Republicans win control of the U.S. Senate on Election Night.
Meet Barack Obama.
Republicans wrestled control of the House from Democrats four years ago. Since then, President Obama has counted on the Democratic majority in the Senate to block the GOP's congressional agenda and make life a little easier for the White House.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has been able to do that because the Senate majority has the power to control the calendar, set the rules and decide..."
"The Department of Defense inspector general has issued a scathing review of Rep. Ronny Jackson during his time serving as the top White House physician, concluding that he made ""sexual and denigrating"" comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy for drinking alcohol while on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted concerns from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper care.
The findings outlined in the report, which was obtained by CNN prior to its release on Wednesday, stem from a years-long IG investigation into..."
The reactions to the allegation that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney have highlighted deep divisions within the Republican Party and underscored the growing tribalism that has infected the nation’s politics.
"WASHINGTON – The House passed a $1.37 trillion spending package that includes money for President Donald Trump's border wall, funding for gun violence research and increasing the age for purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21.
The approval Tuesday could avert a government shutdown that would begin Friday, when the government is set to run out of funding. The package will go to the Senate for approval before being sent to Trump for his signature.
The votes on the spending package, which was broken up into two bills, marked..."
"The House has passed a pair of funding measures to avert a government shutdown on Tuesday, voting across party lines detailing roughly $1.4 trillion in government funding ahead of the Friday deadline.
The spending package -- consisting of two separate spending bills and thousands of pages of legislative text -- was introduced on Monday, and includes a boost on domestic spending backed by Democrats while also upping military spending.
It also includes an increase in funding for President Donald Trump's border wall and largely keeps the status quo on the..."
"It was late Friday when the New York Times first reported on a stunning story: according to U.S. intelligence, while peace talks were underway to end the long-running conflict in Afghanistan, a Russian military intelligence unit ""offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan -- including targeting American troops.""
Soon after, most of the nation's leading news agencies confirmed the story: U.S. intelligence agencies have reason to believe Vladimir Putin's government offered financial rewards to those who killed American servicemen and women.
Among the many questions is..."
"Top officials in the White House were aware in early 2019 of classified intelligence indicating Russia was secretly offering bounties to the Taliban for the deaths of Americans, a full year earlier than has been previously reported, according to U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the intelligence.
The assessment was included in at least one of President Donald Trump’s written daily intelligence briefings at the time, according to the officials. Then-national security adviser John Bolton also told colleagues at the time that he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in..."
"Just count the damn votes.
We are nearing the end of a ridiculous pandemic-laden election season, where we may hit record turnout despite the most blatant attempt to suppress the vote in a generation. More than 90 million people have already voted, and we may reach a record turnout of over 150 million on Election Day. I am sure we would have exceeded that number by millions more votes if President Donald Trump and Republicans had not fought efforts around the country to make voting during the pandemic a little..."
"The painful public collapse Friday of Paul Ryan's biggest endeavor as House speaker — legislation to unwind the Democratic health care law he and his party spent years castigating as a disaster — dealt a serious blow to the Wisconsin Republican.
But as embarrassing a setback as this was — Obamacare is here to stay ""for the foreseeable future,"" Ryan conceded — he isn't going anywhere."

During Sunday's game at SoFi stadium in Inglewood, California, Lebron James, Chris Tucker, Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, Matt Damon and more were caught on camera without face coverings, to the dismay of some users on social media. 
Everyone at SoFi Stadium ages 2 or older were required to wear a mask unless they were actively drinking or eating. In California, there is a statewide mandate for people to wear masks indoors until..."
"WASHINGTON — American intelligence officials have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan — including targeting American troops — amid the peace talks to end the long-running war there, according to officials briefed on the matter.
The United States concluded months ago that the Russian unit, which has been linked to assassination attempts and other covert operations in Europe intended to destabilize the West or take revenge on turncoats, had covertly offered rewards for successful attacks last year."

"To many Republicans, the Obama administration's handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, represents a massive scandal rivaling the one that drove Richard Nixon from the presidency.

"Tuesday was the best day for Democrats politically since Barack Obama won reelection in 2012. Remember, conservatives scored significant victories in the November 2014, 2015 and 2016 elections. Democrats desperately needed some wins after they went all-in on a House special election in Georgia this spring and lost. Last night, they got them."
"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a stern warning to the House impeachment managers and President Donald Trump’s counsel in the final hours of the first day of the Senate impeachment trial after speeches by both sides began to feature personal attacks.
Both House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler and White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump’s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow called each other liars; Nadler accused senators of treachery; and Sekulow said it was Nadler who was being treacherous.
“It is appropriate at this point for me to..."
"WASHINGTON – Chief Justice John Roberts admonished the House managers and the president’s counsel after a fiery back and forth during the debate over amendments to a resolution outlining the rules and format of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
Roberts said he felt he had to ""admonish"" both sides ""in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body. One reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner, and using language that is not conducive to..."
"Senate Republicans do not want to be held responsible for rejecting the historic nomination of Loretta E. Lynch, the first African-American woman picked to be attorney general. But they also are in no hurry to see her confirmed because of her defense of President Obama’s immigration policies.
That contradiction showed signs of being self defeating on Friday, when a visibly emotional Mr. Obama elevated the issue at a news conference by saying “Enough! Enough!” about the record delay, after a call the day before from Jeb Bush, one of the..."
"The chairman of the local Baha’i congregation concluded his prayer with “Allah-u-Abha,” which loosely translates to “God the All-Glorious.” A Jew offered a prayer speaking of “the songs of David, your servant.” And a Wiccan priestess, mindful of her venue in the town of Greece, N.Y., thought that Athena and Apollo were apt deities to call upon.
But they were the exceptions. Almost every other “chaplain of the month” during a decade of town board meetings in this Rochester suburb was a Christian, and more often than not called on..."
"Whatever the “alt-right” is or was, it no longer has a spokesman within 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, with the possible exception of the president. A little before noon on Friday, the White House confirmed that Steve Bannon, the embattled “economic nationalist” whose mastery of Breitbart News helped get Donald Trump elected—thus planting the seed of his own demise—had tendered his resignation. Bannon’s exit, while not unexpected, still sent shock waves across the political and media worlds. Would Trump moderate himself in the absence of the self-proclaimed “alt-right” architect, or had he..."
"A draft report of a partisan audit of the 2020 presidential election results commissioned by Arizona state Senate Republicans confirms President Joe Biden’s win over Donald Trump in Maricopa County, the Arizona Republic first reported Thursday.
The county confirmed the conclusion on Twitter but did not release the text of the three-volume report, led by contractor Cyber Ninjas. Instead, it slammed the report as being “littered with errors & faulty conclusions” about how the election was conducted.
Not only did the draft report fail to show that the election was “stolen”..."
"Post-election protests were held in numerous cities Wednesday, with several spilling into the night. Most were peaceful but some grew tense and even violent. Dozens of arrests were made.
Demands depended on circumstances, with some demonstrators insisting every vote be counted and others that vote counting be stopped.
As votes were being tallied in the critical battleground state of Arizona Wednesday evening, some members of the extremist group AZ Patriots entered the Maricopa County Recorder's Office in downtown Phoenix, reports the CBS affiliate there, KPHO-TV. They livestreamed as they did...."
"A hacking of a major pipeline, the latest evidence of the nation’s vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, prompted questions about whether the administration should go further.
A pipeline that provides the East Coast with nearly half its gasoline and jet fuel remained shuttered on Sunday after yet another ransomware attack, prompting emergency White House meetings and new questions about whether an executive order strengthening cybersecurity for federal agencies and contractors goes far enough even as President Biden prepares to issue it.
The order, drafts of which have been circulating to government officials..."
"The parents of two Americans killed in the 2012 attack on a United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, filed a lawsuit on Monday against Hillary Clinton, saying that her “‘extreme carelessness’ in handling confidential and classified information” while secretary of state contributed to the conditions that led to their sons’ deaths."
"To those who do not want to see the US president run for re-election, Joe Biden has a message: “Watch me.”
A self-assured Biden, riding high from Democrats’ history-defying showing in this year’s midterm elections, said at a post-election press conference that he intends to seek another term, but that it was ultimately a “family decision”.
“I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it,” Biden told reporters, indicating that he would sit down with his family over the holidays and announce his decision..."
"Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel on Wednesday said the end of the coronavirus pandemic could be on the horizon.
“I think that is a reasonable scenario,” he told CNBC when asked whether he thought the pandemic was winding down. “There’s an 80% chance that as omicron evolves or SarsCov-2 virus evolves, we are going to see less and less virulent viruses.”
Moderna along with Pfizer pioneered the use of mRNA vaccines against the novel coronavirus, greatly reducing the severity of infection in those who got the jab.
Likewise, the chances of a new..."
"The omicron wave that assaulted the United States this winter also bolstered its defenses, leaving enough protection against the coronavirus that future spikes will likely require much less — if any — dramatic disruption to society.
Millions of individual Americans’ immune systems now recognize the virus and are primed to fight it off if they encounter omicron, or even another variant.
About half of eligible Americans have received booster shots, there have been nearly 80 million confirmed infections overall and many more infections have never been reported. One influential model..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other House Democratic leaders condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) in a statement Thursday after she wrote a tweet that seemed to compare the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban. “Legitimate criticism of the policies of both the United States and Israel is protected by the values of free speech and public debate,” the group wrote. “But drawing false equivalencies between democracies like the U.S. and Israel and groups that engage in terrorism like Hamas and the Taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress..."
"As Sen. Mary Landrieu soldiered through her re-election race this year with sinking poll numbers and the heavy drag of President Barack Obama, the refrain from her strategists and supporters was always the same: Don't count her out. She's a fighter. She will pull it off in the end.
But in the hours before a runoff election on Saturday, when the three-term Louisiana Democrat faces Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, it is hard to find anyone predicting the kind of eleventh hour victory that Landrieu pulled off in 1996 and..."
"She has been rebuffed by her liberal colleagues in Washington and pilloried at home for voting with the president, and has watched helplessly while her Democratic base has eroded like a cheap levee.
These are hard times for Mary L. Landrieu, the last Deep South Democrat in the United States Senate.
But on the cusp of a Saturday runoff election that feels as much like a race against history as against a Republican opponent, Ms. Landrieu has been barnstorming around her home state on what she called her “Louisiana First..."
"The election was over. As President Obama faced the press in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, the anger and bitterness of his long battle with Mitt Romney seemed to have faded. Unlike President George W. Bush after his 2004 re-election — and his comments about having political capital and intending to spend it — Obama seemed a bit more humble victor, talking more about compromise and saying he was willing to hear other points of view to solve the nation's problems.
But all the niceties disappeared..."
"Barack Obama has said nothing directly about whom hell appoint to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, but he sent what the political world is regarding as a clear signal when he emphatically vouched for Susan Rices integrity last week.
If Obama does nominate Rice, the current U.N. ambassador and his longtime friend, it will create a very public showdown between the president and the man he defeated in 2008. The question is whether John McCain, who has emerged as the GOPs loudest Rice critic and pledged to block..."
"President Donald Trump warned Saturday of “traffic & commercial delays” along the southern border as a result of the administration’s decision earlier this week to ramp up the number of immigration officers processing Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.
“We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border’s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States,” the president wrote on Twitter."
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom embraced a politically explosive and legally dubious attempt to pry loose President Donald Trump’s tax returns on Tuesday, signing legislation that would boot Trump from California primary ballots if he doesn’t make his filings public.
For Democrats who wield absolute control over Sacramento, the measure offered a chance to directly confront a president who is deeply unpopular among most California voters — and for Newsom to escalate his long-standing feud with the president while distinguishing himself from Gov. Jerry Brown, who vetoed a similar measure in..."
"After months of negotiations, and fits and starts, House Republicans have unveiled revised legislation to help Puerto Rico tackle its $70 billion debt.
The bill, released just before midnight on Wednesday, is the third attempt by lawmakers to aid the commonwealth, which is home to 3.5 million Americans. Its underlying text is primarily unchanged, but is now language the Treasury Department appears ready to support. If passed, it would establish an oversight board to guide Puerto Rico’s government through the restructuring of its debt — a power the island..."
"Since early in the pandemic, both Republican- and Democratic-leaning pundits have portrayed virtual school as an educational disaster for students, an economic disaster for the country, and a political disaster for Democrats. They’ve also united in blaming teachers’ unions, rather than the pandemic and the government’s failed response to it, for school districts’ decisions to go virtual. This narrative waned as schools across the country returned to in-person instruction in 2021.
However, teachers union-bashing has returned with a vengeance in the past few weeks, as the omicron variant infects record numbers of students and staff members...."
"Nothing has done more to fuel the national debate over police tactics than the dramatic, sometimes grisly videos: A man gasping “I can’t breathe” through a police chokehold on Staten Island, a 12-year-old boy shot dead in a park in Cleveland. And now, perhaps the starkest video yet, showing a South Carolina police officer shooting a fleeing man in the back."
"Amid the covid-19 pandemic and the protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd, bond funds have risen to prominence as a focus of philanthropic energy. “If you can’t march, donate to a bond fund” became a common refrain in social media posts as an isolated public sought to make a difference from home through viral donation-matching campaigns. Within days, the Minnesota Freedom Fund announced that it had raised $20 million. The Chicago Community Bond fund has raised $3.5 million from 75,000 donors worldwide."
"President Obama will nominate Loretta E. Lynch, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, to be the next attorney general, reaching outside his inner circle to fill a key post, the White House said Friday.
If confirmed, Ms. Lynch, 55, would be the first African-American woman to be the nation’s top law enforcement official. Mr. Obama will announce her selection at a ceremony Saturday in the Roosevelt Room. He will be joined by Ms. Lynch and Eric H. Holder Jr., the current attorney general, who has announced his plans to step..."
"At first glance, it looked like President Barack Obama was pandering to country music lovers everywhere.
Obama moved to fill his administration's open attorney general post on Friday by nominating Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn and definitely not a recording artist.
But many people thought they'd heard or read Loretta Lynn, the country music singer. Confusion quickly took hold on Twitter. Then came the jokes. Here are some of the be"
"WASHINGTON (AP) — In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump now is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of Florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice, and only days after threatening to sue Nevada over a new vote-by-mail law.
His encouragement follows a surge in Democratic requests to vote for mail in Florida, a state that Trump almost certainly must win to secure a second term. Democrats currently have about 1.9 million Floridians signed up to vote by mail this November, almost 600,000 more than..."
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office is not staying silent following explosive accusations by a lawyer for President Donald Trump’s transition team that the investigators looking into claims of collusion with Moscow during the campaign unlawfully received tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration.
"Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Monday that he has come under increasing pressure in recent days from fellow Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who he said questioned the validity of legally cast absentee ballots, in an effort to reverse President Trump’s narrow loss in the state.
In a wide-ranging interview about the election, Raffensperger expressed exasperation over a string of baseless allegations coming from Trump and his allies about the integrity of the Georgia results, including claims that Dominion Voting Systems, the Colorado-based manufacturer of Georgia’s..."
"After a barrage of unfounded claims from President Donald Trump questioning various aspects of Georgia’s voting system, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger fired back.
In a series of Facebook posts from the Secretary of State page, Raffensperger, a Republican, addressed claims about the makers of the state’s election system, Dominion, as well as claims made by the president about Georgia’s recount and absentee ballots system.
Raffensperger has faced a string of attacks. Last week he was under fire from his own party. Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue..."
"A federal court threw out a Republican challenge to Pennsylvania’s new electoral map on Monday, dealing a blow to GOP efforts to get rid of congressional districts that are friendlier to Democrats. Now all eyes are on the US Supreme Court, the only court that could halt Pennsylvania from holding its 2018 midterm elections under the new map."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that an attack from Russian forces in the east is looming. But he said Ukrainian troops are ready.

"(CNN) - The mayor of Seattle on Wednesday told President Donald Trump to ""go back to your bunker,"" after Trump appeared to suggest he would intervene in the city's growing protests and called for law and order.
""Take back your city NOW. If you don't do it, I will,"" the President warned Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan on Wednesday. ""This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped [sic] IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!""
Trump also claimed that the protesters, who he called ""domestic terrorists,""..."
"Amid a flurry of new developments in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, there’s one revelation that’s particularly dramatic.

"Rep. Liz Cheney said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was trying to ""cover up"" what happened at the Capitol riot by refusing to work with the House committee investigating it.
Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee, told CNN on Wednesday: ""I wish that he were a brave and honorable man. He's clearly trying to cover up what happened. He has an obligation to come forward and we'll get to the truth.""
She also refused to rule out the option of subpoenaing him, CNN reported.

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is refusing a request by the House panel investigating the U.S. Capitol insurrection to submit to an interview and turn over records pertaining to the deadly riot.
The panel is seeking first-hand details from members of Congress on then-President Donald Trump’s actions on the day hundreds of his supporters brutally beat police, stormed the building and interrupted the certification of the 2020 presidential election.
McCarthy, R-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday refusing to cooperate with the House committee. He said the investigation was not legitimate and..."
"Think of it as Super Postponed Day.
June 2 had been an afterthought on the Democratic primary calendar. Ever since Joseph R. Biden Jr. seized the mantle of front-runner, voters in New Jersey and a few other states scheduled to vote that day assumed the Democratic horse race would be over before their primaries rolled around.
But with numerous states pushing back voting to June 2 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the date has gained sudden prominence. It now confers a huge bounty of delegates, second only to Super Tuesday..."
"ATLANTA (AP) — There is no 12th Democratic presidential debate on the horizon now that the nominating process is in a holding pattern due to the coronavirus pandemic.
One of the Democratic National Committee’s lead debate organizers, Xochitl Hinojosa, said the party has not set a date or secured a television broadcasting partner for what would be the final encounter of the dozen that DNC Chairman Tom Perez promised at the campaign’s outset.
There’s no evidence that either Joe Biden, the prospective nominee, or Bernie Sanders, Biden’s last remaining rival,..."
"President Joe Biden on Tuesday forcefully defended the FBI as the agency and its employees have come under withering criticism and threats of violence since executing a search warrant at former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence earlier this month.
“It’s sickening to see the new attacks on the FBI, threatening the life of law enforcement and their families, for simply carrying out the law and doing their job,” Biden said before a crowd of more than 500 at Wilkes University. “I’m opposed to defunding the police; I’m also opposed to defunding the..."
"If you doubt the power of Donald Trump’s endorsement, look no further than the Ohio Senate race.
Since April 15, when Trump backed J.D. Vance in the Republican primary, the venture capitalist and author of “Hillbilly Elegy” has zoomed to the top of the public polls. Vance jumped from 11 percent of likely voters in March to 23 percent now, according to Fox News.
The real test of Trump’s party boss mojo, however, is fast approaching: actual elections, beginning with Ohio’s on Tuesday. Trump has endorsed candidates in at least 40 Republican primaries that..."
"On the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, outgoing national security adviser Susan Rice sent herself an email that has since drawn intense scrutiny from Republicans.
Now the full text of the email has been declassified, and POLITICO reviewed it. It says that then-FBI Director James Comey worried about sharing classified information with the Trump team because of incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn’s frequent conversations with the Russian ambassador but that Comey had no knowledge of Flynn sharing classified information with the envoy."
"The commission that oversees the general election presidential debates said Wednesday it will be making changes to the format of the remaining two debates. One key change it plans to implement: Cutting off the microphones of President Trump and Joe Biden if they break the rules, according to a source familiar with the commission's deliberations. The plans have not been finalized and the commission is still considering how it would carry out the plan.
The Commission on Presidential Debates is responding to Tuesday's face-off between President Trump and former Vice..."
"He was supposed to be the calm one, cool and unflappable under his Ray-Bans and beltless blue bespoke suits. If Steve Bannon was the Rumpelstiltskin of the administration, donning multiple half-tucked dress shirts at a time and always carrying a clutch of briefing papers and barreling through the administrative state, Jared Kushner, through pedigree and temperament, could reach out one of his long, elegant fingers and tap everyone in the West Wing on the shoulder and urge them to just cool out a bit. In a White House sullied by..."
"Concern over crime has reached the highest point in four years amid a spike in killings in big cities and an uptick in violent crime, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday, and the percentage of Americans who say crime in the United States is “extremely serious” has reached its highest point in two decades.
The poll also finds that a sizable majority believe racial discrimination still exists in the country and say they hope that communities can find solutions to crime beyond putting more police officers on American streets,..."
"The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation to recognize Juneteenth as a legal public holiday.
“Making Juneteenth a federal holiday is a major step forward to recognize the wrongs of the past — but we must continue to work to ensure equal justice and fulfill the promise of the Emancipation Proclamation and our Constitution,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
The measure, sponsored by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 60 senators, cleared the upper chamber by unanimous consent, meaning no lawmaker objected to..."
"The Senate unanimously approved a bill Tuesday that would make Juneteenth, the date commemorating the end of chattel slavery in the United States, a legal public holiday.
The holiday is celebrated on June 19, and it began in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned they had been freed under the Emancipation Proclamation.
President Abraham Lincoln had signed the proclamation outlawing slavery years earlier, but it was not until 1865 that those in bondage in Texas were freed.
The measure is expected to be approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives as..."
"The battle for control of Congress was front and center on Tuesday night, with races taking shape in several intensely contested House seats in California and New Jersey. But there were revealing elections in the Midwest and the South, too, underscoring President Trump’s power in the Republican Party and the different ways Democrats hope to loosen his hold on red-state America."
"New year, same old high inflation.
A key measure of inflation climbed to a near-40-year high last month. Economists are hopeful that America will reach the peak of the pandemic-era price increases in the early months of 2021. Here's to hoping.
The consumer price index rose 7.5% in the 12 months ending January, not adjusted for seasonal swings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. It was the steepest annual price increase since February 1982 and worse than economists had forecast.
Stripping out food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile, prices increased..."
"On the morning of March 11th, 2004, ten bombs exploded during the morning commute at Madrid’s Atocha train station. One hundred and ninety-two people were murdered and over 2,000 injured. Three days later, the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar lost power in an election that swung suddenly to the Socialist Party."
"The US government is stepping up its efforts to relieve the supply chain nightmare that has led to shortages of some goods, higher prices for consumes and now threatens to slow the economic recovery.
The White House will work with companies and ports on a ""90-day sprint"" to alleviate bottlenecks, according to a senior administration official. Some will start working 24/7 to address the backlogs.
In a speech Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced the Port of Los Angeles will move to 24/7 service, bringing it into line with operations at the Port of..."
"One of the most successful elements of the government’s response to the coronavirus recession — protecting people on the margins from falling into poverty — is faltering as the safety net shrinks and federal benefits expire.
Major recessions are especially fraught for low-income earners, whose finances can veer from tenuous to dire with one missed paycheck. But as the economy cratered this spring, economists and poverty experts were mildly surprised to discover that the torrent of government support that followed — particularly the $600 a week in expanded unemployment benefits..."

Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, was part of a small group of White House officials assigned to listen in on Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump’s manipulation of Ukraine..."
"President Barack Obama joined nearly 100 members of Congress in Selma, Alabama, on Saturday for the 50th anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday"" -- a watershed moment of the civil rights movement -- where he honored the men and women who stood their ground in a violent confrontation with police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
""We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod, tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone..."
"Former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh announced Sunday that he will challenge President Trump in the 2020 primary, becoming the second Republican to wage a bid against the president.
Walsh, a talk-radio host, was elected to Congress in 2010 as part of the tea party wave and served one term. He has described himself as an immigration hard-liner and said he would not challenge Trump from the center but from the right and on moral grounds."
"Manhattan's district attorney has convened the grand jury that is expected to decide whether to indict former president Donald Trump, other executives at his company or the business itself should prosecutors present the panel with criminal charges, according to two people familiar with the development.
The panel was convened recently and will sit three days a week for six months. It is likely to hear several matters — not just the Trump case ­— during the duration of its term, which is longer than a traditional New York state grand-jury..."
"The number of Americans filing for jobless aid stayed essentially flat in the last week of 2020, as enhanced unemployment benefits kicked in for laid-off workers.
Roughly 787,000 people applied for unemployment in the week ending January 2, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's just 3,000 less than the previous week's claims, which were revised up to 790,000. Another 161,000 applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a special federal program for self-employed, freelance and gig workers.
It's the first time since March that new unemployment claims, including for self-employed workers, fell..."
"If you’re familiar with the navel-gazing internecine squabbles of the US national media, you probably know that Bari Weiss, the millennial conservative writer who for years attracted controversy and online consternation for her opinion columns, recently quit the New York Times, saying that the newspaper was insufficiently supportive of her because of her political views."
"French prosecutors confirmed Thursday that the ringleader of the deadly terrorist siege in Paris last week was killed in a massive pre-dawn police raid a day earlier, as nations across the region sought to enact countermeasures in view of new intelligence suggesting that terrorist cells may be planning more attacks against European targets, including Vatican City."
"American Special Operations forces mounted a rare raid into eastern Syria early Saturday, killing a leader of the Islamic State and about a dozen militant fighters, as well as capturing his wife and freeing an 18-year old Yazidi woman whom Pentagon officials said had been held as a slave.
In the first successful raid by American ground troops since the military campaign against the Islamic State began last year, two dozen Delta Force commandos entered Syria aboard Black Hawk helicopters and V-22 Ospreys and killed the leader, Abu Sayyaf. One..."
"The U.S. operation to kill a top ISIS commander on Saturday was a ""significant blow"" to the terror group, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said.
The ISIS commander, Abu Sayyaf, was killed after he fought capture in the raid at al-Omar in eastern Syria, Carter said in a statement. His wife, an Iraqi named Umm Sayyaf, was caught and is being held in Iraq.
Carter said he had ordered the special forces raid against the terror group, also known as ISIL, at the direction of President"
"Meeting President Joe Biden’s goal of offering 500 million free at-home Covid tests for Americans will require a massive scale-up in test manufacturing that may take months to achieve — falling short of demand as the omicron variant drives a surge in infections.
The U.S. had a supply of around 200 million at-home rapid tests in December. Test makers have indicated they will be able to increase that to just over 500 million a month by March with added capacity from current manufacturers and the recent clearance of two new tests from Roche and Siemens..."
"The Trump administration on Monday pushed back against an internal government report, obtained by the New York Times, that predicts the daily coronavirus death toll could nearly double in the United States by early June.
The Times story cites an internal CDC update, acquired from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that predicts the number of deaths per day from COVID-19 will reach about 3,000 by June 1.
More than 68,000 people in the United States have already died from the coronavirus pandemic, summarily eclipsing an earlier estimate of a total..."
"As President Trump presses for states to reopen their economies, his administration is privately projecting a steady rise in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths over the next several weeks. The daily death toll will reach about 3,000 on June 1, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times, nearly double the current number of about 1,750.
The projections, based on government modeling pulled together in chart form by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, forecast about 200,000 new cases each day by the end of the..."
"Sen. John McCain said Russian election-related hacks threaten to ""destroy democracy"" and faulted the American response as ""totally paralyzed.""
McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, again called for a select committee to investigate the CIA's finding that Russia hacked Democrats' emails in a bid to help President-elect Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton."
"Rex Tillerson did not talk to Donald Trump before he was fired Tuesday and apparently found out from the president’s tweet about it this morning, according to the State Department. A report from The Washington Post—which broke the news of Tillerson’s firing—claimed Trump asked the outgoing secretary of State to step aside last Friday, days before his strongly critical comments against Russia on Monday. However, a statement from Undersecretary of State Steve Goldstein, tweeted by ABC News’ Conor Finnegan, said: “The Secretary had every intention of staying because of the..."
"WASHINGTON — A Dallas megachurch whose pastor has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump was approved for a forgivable loan worth $2 million to $5 million, according to long-awaited government data released on Monday.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a rally last month at the First Baptist Church of Dallas, whose pastor, Robert Jeffress, has been on Trump's evangelical advisory board."
"Donald Trump referred to impeachment proceedings against him as a “lynching” in a Tuesday morning tweet, sparking condemnation for using such a racially charged word to describe his political predicament.
“So some day,” the president wrote, “if a Democrat becomes president and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the president, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here – a lynching. But we will WIN!”
The tweet fit with Trump’s history of racist..."
"President Donald Trump compared the impeachment inquiry against him to ""a lynching"" on Tuesday, drawing condemnation for comparing a congressional process to vigilante murders aimed mostly at black Americans.
""All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!"" Trump tweeted.
African-American lawmakers took particular offense at the post.
""What the hell is wrong with you?"" tweeted Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. ""Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look..."
"Donald Trump, surging in the polls, arrived at this lakeside enclave and trained his ire on perhaps the only target that aggravates his supporters as much as the Obama Administration: Republicans.
""They're all talk, they're no action,"" Trump said, revving up his fiery takedown of politicians.
""I'm more disappointed in many ways with the Republicans,"" Trump said. ""They have this great indignation, whether it's Benghazi or the emails... nothing ever happens."""
"The rapid development of approaches to combating Covid-19 has changed how the pandemic affects our lives. While there are now a number of safe and effective layers of protection for adults to reduce their risk of the worst impacts of Covid-19, young children remain relatively unshielded.
Although children have been at a lower risk of severe Covid-19 compared with older adults, the past six months have been the most perilous time of the pandemic for them — especially very young children. Children under 5 are the only age group in..."
"The Pentagon on Wednesday swept away Trump-era policies that largely banned transgender people from serving in the military, issuing new rules that offer them wider access to medical care and assistance with gender transition.
The new department regulations allow transgender people who meet military standards to enlist and serve openly in their self-identified gender, and they will be able to get medically necessary transition-related care authorized by law, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters during a briefing.
The changes come after a two-month Pentagon review aimed at developing guidelines..."
"A D.C.-based federal judge ruled Sunday that President Donald Trump's appointment of Ken Cuccinelli as acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a decision that suspends two policies Cuccinelli implemented while leading the agency.
Cuccinelli, an immigration hard-liner who was previously attorney general in Virginia, became acting head of USCIS in June, assuming the newly created role of “principal deputy director."" In November, Cuccinelli also assumed the position of ""senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary"" at USCIS' parent agency, the Department..."
"The federal government’s ethics agency has rarely received much attention in Washington. That changed with the arrival of President Trump and an administration stocked with unusually wealthy appointees who have ties to industries they now help regulate. Suddenly, the usually sleepy Office of Government Ethics was clashing with the White House."
"A day after a massacre on a U.S. college campus, Jeb Bush said “stuff happens” but that it should not lead to tighter gun restrictions.
This isn’t the first time the 2016 contender, who has been struggling to connect with voters, has conveyed his ideas poorly.
In the immediate aftermath, as the floundering candidate's two inelegant words shot around the Twittersphere and were seized upon by a reporter who paraphrased them in a question to President Obama during a White House press conference, the uproar did more to..."
"Jeb Bush drew a sharp rebuke from President Obama on Friday after the Republican presidential candidate shrugged off any need for government action in the wake of the massacre of nine people at a community college in Oregon.
“Look, stuff happens,” Mr. Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, said at a campaign event in South Carolina. “There’s always a crisis, and the impulse is always to do something and it’s not always the right thing to do.”"
"Facing fierce opposition, the Trump administration on Tuesday dropped its proposal to bar international students from studying in the United States if all of their classes are taught online amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The swift turnaround by the Department of Homeland Security came during a federal district court hearing about a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and MIT seeking a temporary injunction of the new guidelines. It represents an unusual retreat from an administration that has aggressively sought to curb immigration."
"BAGRAM AIR FIELD, Afghanistan (AP) — President Donald Trump paid a surprise Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan, where he announced the U.S. and the Taliban have been engaged in ongoing peace talks and said he believes the Taliban want a cease-fire.
Trump arrived at Bagram Air Field shortly after 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday and spent 3½ hours on the ground during his first trip to the site of America’s longest war. He served turkey and thanked the troops, delivered a speech and sat down with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani before..."
"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that he wanted to shut down Parliament for several weeks ahead of Britain’s upcoming departure from the European Union, an unusual maneuver that would rob his opponents of time to thwart a no-deal Brexit.
The announcement prompted howls of outrage from many lawmakers, who said that they were being deprived of their democratic voice on Britain’s most momentous decision in generations. It increased the chances that the country would sail out of the European Union at the end of October with no transition deal..."
"Seafarers, truck drivers and airline workers have endured quarantines, travel restrictions and complex Covid-19 vaccination and testing requirements to keep stretched supply chains moving during the pandemic.
But many are now reaching their breaking point, posing yet another threat to the badly tangled network of ports, container vessels and trucking companies that moves goods around the world.
In an open letter Wednesday to heads of state attending the United Nations General Assembly, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and other industry groups warned of a ""global transport system collapse"" if governments do not restore freedom of movement to transport workers and..."
"The Food and Drug Administration pulled its authorization of two of the most used monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID-19 this week, leaving doctors with fewer options to help their patients avoid the hospital.
Why did the FDA shut them down?
Because the two, from drugmakers Regeneron and Eli Lilly, don't work against the omicron variant that now causes more than 99% of coronavirus infections in the United States.
""All the data show that these older antibodies are ineffective against omicron,"" said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and..."
"Joe Biden wrapped up a team heavy on deal-makers and fighters to lead his climate effort Thursday, tasking it with remaking and cleaning up the nation’s transportation and power-plant systems, and as fast as politically possible.
While the president-elect’s picks have the experience to do the heavy lifting required in a climate overhaul of the U.S. economy, they also seem to be reassuring skeptics that he won’t neglect the low-income, working class and minority communities hit hardest by fossil fuel pollution and climate change."
"Iran said on Sunday that within hours it would breach the limits on uranium enrichment set four years ago in an accord with the United States and other international powers that was designed to keep Tehran from producing a nuclear weapon.
The latest move inches Iran closer to where it was before the accord: on the path to being able to produce an atomic bomb."
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law on Friday that limits the use of rap lyrics in criminal court cases in the state.
The law requires “a court, in a criminal proceeding where a party seeks to admit as evidence a form of creative expression, to consider specified factors when balancing the probative value of that evidence against the substantial danger of undue prejudice.”
The new law underscores a larger national conversation around prohibiting the use of rap lyrics as evidence in criminal proceedings, a tactic critics have..."
"Advisers to Mitt Romney on Thursday defended his sharp criticism of President Obama and said that the deadly protests sweeping the Middle East would not have happened if the Republican nominee were president.
“Theres a pretty compelling story that if you had a President Romney, youd be in a different situation, Richard Williamson, a top Romney foreign policy adviser, said in an interview. “For the first time since Jimmy Carter, weve had an American ambassador assassinated."
"Appearing in Virginia on Thursday, Republican Mitt Romney tried to bring his campaign back to the issues he has focused on before in the swing state: the nation's economy and strengthening the military.
A day after Romney ignited a debate over his criticism of President Obama's handling of events in Libya and Egypt, the Republican presidential nominee largely steered clear of discussing unrest in Egypt and the attack on an American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.
The violence, sparked by an anti-Islam film, on Thursday spread..."
"A federal judge ruled today that Michael Slager—the former South Carolina police officer who in May pleaded guilty to using excessive force and violating the civil rights of the late Walter Scott—committed second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Scott. Federal sentencing guidelines called for 19 to 24 years in prison, and US District Court Judge David Norton’s settled on a 20-year sentence. Slager has 14 days to appeal the sentence."
"Kindergarten teacher Natalie Tran is excited to be back in her Oakland, California, classroom with her 25 4-year-olds. But she's not surprised that many other teachers across the country didn't return for the upcoming school year. 
""We need higher pay,"" she told CBS News. ""We need more respect for the teaching profession because it's extremely difficult, and we really need to have manageable class sizes.""
Nationwide, there are at least 280,000 fewer public school teachers than there were before the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "
"Oriales GarcÃƒÂ­a Rubio knows how it feels to want more. When she was a girl in central Cuba in the 1930s, her family of nine lived in a one-room house with a dirt floor.

"Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is having moment in the national spotlight, underscored by his selection to deliver the Republican response to President Obamas State of the Union.
Rubio also is featured on Time magazines cover this week, with the headline “the Republican savior.
But even as his celebrity within his party rises, that phrase went too far for Rubio, a Catholic who often talks about his faith. He responded to the cover story in a tweet Wednesday morning:"
"Over 1200 of my fellow law professors recently signed a petition urging the Senate to reject President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Jeff Sessions to become attorney general. Critics correctly point out that the vast majority of the signatories are liberal Democrats, and (less correctly) therefore dismiss the statement as mere partisan politics."
"Robust early October fundraising has left Hillary Clinton's campaign with a comfortable $62 million for the final days of the presidential election, while Donald Trump's own fundraising efforts over the same period of time disappointed, leaving him with only $16 million in his campaign coffers by Oct. 19."
"The Obama administration issued new rules on Friday that allow closely held for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby Stores to opt out of providing women with insurance coverage for contraceptives if the companies have religious objections.
Women enrolled in such health plans would still be able to get birth control at no cost, the administration said. Insurers would pay for contraceptive services, but the payments would be separate from the employer’s health plan.
The rules came in response to a decision by the Supreme Court in June 2014. In that..."
"On Sunday night, as part of a broader piece about the vaccination efforts in Florida, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi noted that Publix, a grocery store that had partnered with the state to distribute vaccines, had also donated $100,000 to Gov. Ron DeSantis' 2022 reelection campaign.
It was a passing mention, without any other facts or context to back it up. Just that Publix was working with the state to administer vaccines and that the company's PAC had made this donation to the governor.
The insinuation here, however, was pretty..."
"North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature and its Democratic governor announced late Wednesday that they had reached an agreement to repeal the controversial state law that curbs legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and sets rules that affect transgender bathroom use in public buildings."
"Protesters marched into Lafayette Square opposite the White House on Saturday and chanted “families belong together” to counter President Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, and were joined in declaring that message by dozens of other rallies from New York to California. While the occupant of the White House was away for the weekend at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club, images of the rallies were broadcast by cable news networks throughout the day."
"With the Georgia Senate runoff races just two weeks away, the Department of Homeland Security is warning of the possibility of “ideologically motivated violence” and even a foreign influence campaign as voters prepare to go to the polls, according to a new internal report obtained by Yahoo News.

"The lawsuit, led by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, argued the Environmental Protection Agency had no basis for weakening an Obama-era regulation that set the first-ever national limits on carbon dioxide pollution from power plants.
That rule, the Clean Power Plan, required states to implement plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2022, and encouraged that to happen by closing heavily-polluting plants and replacing those energy sources with natural gas or renewable energy. Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is a major contributor to global warming because it traps..."

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to Democrats on Monday that the House will vote to formalize the procedures in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump.
The resolution will outline the terms for public hearings, the disclosure of deposition transcripts, procedures to transfer evidence to the House Judiciary Committee and due process rights for Trump.
Senior Democratic aides said the resolution will be released on Wednesday, with a House vote on Thursday.

"WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought Monday to deprive President Trump of a legal and political argument against the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, announcing she would hold a vote in the full House this Thursday that “affirms the ongoing, existing investigation.”
“We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,” Pelosi said in a written statement. “Nobody is above the law.”

"At first, it didn’t even register as a threat. Then it seemed like a temporary annoyance.
Now, inflation is flashing red for the Federal Reserve’s policymakers — and delivering sticker shock to Americans at the used car lot, the supermarket, the gas station, the rental office.
On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices jumped 7% in December compared with 12 months earlier — the hottest year-over-year inflation since June 1982. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, what is called “core” inflation rose 5.5% over the past year, the..."
"The bumpy economic recovery has had policymakers, economists and Americans households grappling with greater price hikes for groceries, cars, rent and other essentials.
The latest inflation data, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed prices in December rose to a 40-year high, climbing 7.0 percent compared with the year before.
For months, officials at the Federal Reserve and White House argued that pandemic-era inflation will be temporary. But they’ve had to back away from that message, which was increasingly hard to square with what was happening in the economy — and the..."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to bar his accounting firm from turning over eight years of his tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors.
The case, the first concerning Mr. Trump’s personal conduct and business dealings to reach the court, could yield a major ruling on the scope of presidential immunity from criminal investigations.
Last week, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled against Mr. Trump, rejecting his argument that he was absolutely immune from criminal investigation while he remains in office...."
"In a breathtaking turnabout, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday on Fox News that he would “absolutely” back Donald Trump for president in 2024 if he becomes the Republican Party’s nominee.
The startling support came less than two weeks after McConnell’s angry slam of the former president as “practically and morally responsible” for inciting last month’s deadly storming of the U.S. Capitol. “There’s no question,” McConnell said. “The people that stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.” He called Trump’s..."
"Inflation was little changed in the month of August, despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool off the U.S. economy. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that inflation landed at 8.3% last month compared to one year ago.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an 8.1% annual increase. Prices increased 8.5% in July.
Gas prices have fallen for 89 consecutive days and now stand at a national average of $3.70 a gallon, though there is wide geographic variability, with most Western states still above $4 a..."
"Despite objections from some residents, President Donald Trump will travel Wednesday to El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, to review recovery efforts from mass shootings over the weekend, officials said Tuesday.

Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump will travel to Dayton and El Paso, she said, to express his condolences and help provide resources. Trump wants to hear more, she said, from the mayors of the cities and those directly affected.
Conway did not specify which day Trump would go but..."
"Intense heat this summer has set records in the U.S., with some regions topping 110 degrees. Utah residents suffered through 16 straight days of triple-digit heat — the longest such stretch in the 125 years that records have been kept. Around the world, extreme temperatures have killed thousands in Asia and Europe.
Despite this alarming picture of the present, it is likely just the beginning. By mid-century, nearly one-third of U.S. adults are likely to live in counties that experience hazardous heat, according to a new analysis from the First Street..."
"Censuring The Joe Rogan Experience—a podcast whose eponymous host, a muscle-bound man most famous for providing MMA color commentary and pressuring people into eating bull testicles for money—has become an online cause célèbre in recent months after a group of 270 doctors penned an open letter to its distributor, Spotify, accusing the show of having “a concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The letter took particular issue with a recent episode featuring guest Robert Malone, a biochemist who conducted a series of groundbreaking laboratory studies on cells using..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday outlined House Democrats' legislative response to Roe v. Wade being overturned, saying her party is looking at codifying a federal right to an abortion.
Pelosi outlined three areas that House Democrats are examining just days after the Supreme Court gutted federal abortion rights, overturning nearly over a half-century of precedent. These are: protecting sensitive data on reproductive health apps, making it clear that states cannot stop people from traveling to seek an abortion, and once again trying to pass a federal law guaranteeing a..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can resume travel at low risk to themselves – long-awaited news for travelers itching to vacation or see family again.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, who earlier this week issued an urgent plea to limit travel due to fears of another COVID surge, said Friday that the new guidance is based on studies showing the ""real-world'' effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
Vaccinated travelers no longer have to follow the CDC's recommendations to get a COVID-19 test before..."
"People who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can travel freely in the U.S., as long as they remain masked on planes, buses and trains, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday.
It is unclear how much impact the new guidance will have. People are already traveling and making decisions on their own. American Airlines reported Monday that the company's bookings have jumped to 90 percent of what they were before the pandemic.

"Facebook and Twitter on early Wednesday warned social media users that President Donald Trump's claims regarding the election results are potentially misleading, including his claim that he had won the election.
After the president falsely claimed in a speech around 2:30 a.m. ET that he had won the race and baselessly alleged fraud on the behalf of his opponents, Facebook labeled a video feed featuring those comments. With votes still being counted, no clear winner has been determined at this time.
""Final results may be different from initial..."
"Twitter and Facebook have continued to restrict and label posts from President Donald Trump after yesterday’s presidential election, this time addressing a baseless claim that Democratic officials were manipulating vote counts in key states. Twitter flagged the tweet and restricted its reach, saying it was “disputed and might be misleading.” Facebook added a general warning that “final results may be different from the initial vote counts.”
Trump triggered a social media crackdown early this morning after accusing Democrats of trying to steal the election. Neither platform has actually removed his..."
"Thursday night’s Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., will be the sixth of the primary campaign, but only the next to last before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. And as Newt Gingrich can attest, face-offs held in the final weeks and days before the nominating contests tend to matter more. And the attacks tend to get rougher."
"Criminal law specialists and members of the law enforcement community are tough to really shock. But the Justice Department’s announcement that it would drop criminal charges against Michael Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, has provoked, in addition to outrage, a sense of utter demoralization among them. They’ve never seen such a thing before. After all, Mr. Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.
But it’s important to understand why all Americans should be not just shocked but outraged. It’s not just because Mr. Flynn won’t go..."
"The House Judiciary Committee formally presented its case for impeaching President Trump in a 658-page report published online early Monday morning, arguing just days before a final vote in the House that he “betrayed the nation by abusing his high office.”
The report, which echoes similar documents produced after the committee’s approval of impeachment articles for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, contains no new allegations or evidence against Mr. Trump.
But it offers a detailed road map for the two articles of impeachment the committee approved, charging that..."
"The House Judiciary Committee released the full report early Monday from the inquiry that led it to approve two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump in a party-line vote last week.
The 658-page report (which you can read here) was made public days before articles of impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are expected to come before the House floor for a vote. The Democrat-led House is expected to approve the articles of impeachment against Trump.
The report outlines the process that led the..."
"Democrats are on the path to including an endorsement of same-sex marriage for the first time in their official party platform.
NPR's Ari Shapiro reported Monday that the proposal has made it through an important Democratic committee meeting.

The Democratic source relayed that officials unanimously agreed at a recent platform drafting committee meeting in Minneapolis to adopt language end"
"Pandemic shortages, Russia's war in Ukraine, and plain old gouging are hiking prices across the globe. A dollar doesn't go as far as it used to, and many Americans are struggling.
Higher prices at the pump and the grocery store hurt. But there is also some good news.
For one thing, we're actually experiencing less inflation than many other countries. Inflation here is 8 percent, compared to over 10 percent in the U.K. and Eurozone. Turkey has seen rates of over 80 percent.
For another, we're better equipped to weather..."
"Joe Biden’s long arc in public life has always had one final ambition: to sit behind the Resolute Desk of the Oval Office.
He achieved it — albeit, at 78, as the oldest person to assume the presidency. After the turbulence and chaos of his predecessor, Donald Trump, Biden was seen by voters as one who could restore a sense of normalcy and a reassuring tone to the White House.
But Biden also found out, as all his predecessors have, that events beyond his control would shape his time in office..."
"Gender -- the issue that Hillary Clinton struggled to find her balance on during her 2008 campaign -- is front and center as she prepares for a possible 2016 presidential run.
It is, in many ways, a remarkable evolution for a female politician once bedeviled by gender politics to the self-defined ""pantsuit aficionado and glass ceiling cracker"" of today."
"When Hillary Clinton thinks about running for president, do you think she contemplates the fact that no Democrat has been elected to succeed another Democrat since James Buchanan in 1856?
We bring you this factoid in honor of the beginning of the 2016 election season. (Only 55 weeks until the New Hampshire primary!) We’ve got so much time. It’s the perfect moment for random irrelevant trivia about presidential elections of the past. Which, to be honest, is my favorite part.
Consider that succession information for a minute. We have had..."
"Former President Barack Obama is getting pushback from progressive leaders in his party after saying in an interview Wednesday that political candidates who use “snappy” slogans such as “defund the police” could jeopardize their campaign goals on police reform and even lose support from their base.

"President Joe Biden on Tuesday called the deadly supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y. an act of terror and excoriated the white supremacist ideology that inspired the alleged gunman, but he stopped short of announcing a political agenda in the massacre’s aftermath.
“What happened here is simple and straightforward: terrorism,” Biden said during a visit to Buffalo. “Terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate, and a vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group.”
In an emotional speech before the victims’..."
FBI Director James Comey told a Senate panel Wednesday that the killers responsible for last week's California massacre were individually radicalized before they began communicating online prior to their marriage and discussed jihad more than two years before the deadly assault that left 14 dead and 21 wounded.
"A fringe theory suggests that the new coronavirus leaked by accident from a lab in Wuhan.
Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) study infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, and did before the pandemic started. So as questions about how the pandemic started continue to go unanswered, the lab has drawn scrutiny.
Matthew Pottinger, Trump's deputy national security adviser, asked intelligence agencies in January to look into the idea of a Wuhan lab leak, The New York Times reported. But CIA officers didn't find any evidence."
"President Trump isn’t the only one hearing this tale. The political world, Internet theorists, intelligence analysts and global public health officials are abuzz with a big question: Is it possible that the new coronavirus — which causes covid-19 — leaked from a lab?
For months, Chinese authorities have pointed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan as the virus’s likely origin. A cluster of early cases had contact with the market. It sold a wide variety of wildlife that, officials hypothesized, was critical to the virus’s formation and spread...."

"Donald Trump was only joking when he said he would debate Bernie Sanders, his campaign said on Thursday after a morning of media frenzy.
During an appearance on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday, Trump – who on Thursday crossed the delegate threshold necessary to become the Republican presidential nominee – said he would accept an invitation to debate Sanders if the proceeds went to charity."
"The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a blockbuster dispute over a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, setting up a high-stakes showdown over the future of Roe v. Wade.
The battle will be the first test of limits on abortion access to go before the Supreme Court's expanded 6-3 conservative majority and could pave the way for more restrictions, as the dispute takes aim at the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe, which established a woman's right to an abortion. Arguments will likely be heard..."

"Along with critical race theory, “wokeness,” the deep state, and other recent conservative obsessions, it appears we can now add the basic language of economics to the list of things Republicans have decided to go to war on.
Take the latest round of inflation statistics. On Wednesday morning, the U.S. got its first bit of truly good news about the rising cost of living this year. The Consumer Price Index, which has been surging in recent months, remained essentially flat in July. That was largely thanks to tumbling gas prices, which canceled..."

Leading health experts denounced President Donald Trump’s decision to halt U.S. funding for the World Health Organization amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Within hours, Afghanistan's Washington-backed president had left the country and the flag at the U.S. Embassy had been lowered amid a hasty evacuation of diplomatic personnel.
Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president, said on Facebook that his was ""a hard choice,"" but that he decided to leave to prevent bloodshed. He signed off his post with ""Long Live Afghanistan."" The Taliban released a statement saying they had entered..."
"President Donald Trump announced Sunday a left-wing group he thinks are leading the violence at anti-police brutality protests will be officially labeled as terrorists.
""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said in a tweet.
Antifa – short for ""anti-fascists"" – is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that have been involved in some violent clashes in recent years. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership."
"President Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that the United States would designate a group of far-left anti-fascism activists as a terrorist organization, a declaration that lacked any clear legal authority, as his administration sought to blame the group for violent protests across the nation over the weekend.
“The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Mr. Trump wrote."

"An analysis of almost 20,000 coronavirus infections across Scotland has shown the Delta variant of the virus almost doubles the risk of people being admitted to hospital.
The new study also confirmed two doses of vaccine still offers the best protection against the variant, which was first identified in India, and accounts for more than 90 per cent of all new cases in the UK.
Although the vaccines reduced the risk of people needing to be admitted to hospital, it could take up to 28 days after the first dose to have sufficient immunity."
"The Treasury Department said Monday that 39 million families are set to receive monthly child payments beginning on July 15.
The payments are part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which expanded the child tax credit for one year and made it possible to pre-pay the benefits on a monthly basis. Nearly 88% of children are set to receive the benefits without their parents needing to take any additional action.
Qualified families will receive a payment of up to $300 per month for each child under 6..."
"Donald Trump endangered the lives of all members of Congress when he aimed a mob of supporters “like a loaded cannon” at the U.S. Capitol, House Democrats said Tuesday in making their most detailed case yet for why the former president should be convicted and permanently barred from office.

The Democratic legal brief forcefully linked Trump’s baseless efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election to the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, saying he bears..."

“That’s my hope,” the president said before leaving his home state of Delaware for a trip to New Jersey to highlight the child care proposals in..."
"As concerned friends and family members try to convince loved ones to get vaccinated, many are met with the argument: ""I already got COVID, so I can't get it again.""
Health experts say that just isn't true. 
Although antibodies from natural infection may provide some protection against the virus, evidence shows nothing protects against COVID-19 better than vaccines. 
People who have recovered from COVID-19 should get vaccinated to reduce their risk of reinfection, which will prevent transmission and suppress the opportunity for more variants – like the highly contagious delta – to emerge.

""I believe Joe Biden is the President our country desperately needs right now, not because I've known Joe so long, but because I know Joe so well,"" Kerry said in a statement provided by the Biden campaign."
"Donald Trump said it; Jeb Bush said it, too. Frankly, a whole range of people have used the term ""anchor baby"" this week in public discussions about Trump's immigration-related policy ideas -- ideas that include an end to the nearly 150-year-old practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States.
It's the former, known as ""birthright citizenship,"" which is delineated in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution."
"GOP presidential candidates are falling over themselves to get on record with tough immigration plans. A string of them — Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum — have spoken out in some form against birthright citizenship. That's the idea that being born on U.S. soil, regardless of your parents' legal status, automatically makes you a U.S. citizen."

Clinton made the allegations during an interview with David Plouffe, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager. During the interview, Clinton alleged that Russia used 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein as an “asset” and suggested that Gabbard would play a similar role in the upcoming election without mentioning her name.

"President Donald Trump has been discussing the possibility of issuing pardons for his family members and some close associates, multiple sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.
One source said the conversations in recent days were within the context of a president who feels embattled, and not because Trump believes he or any of his family members had done anything illegal.

"Most available evidence points in the direction of a popular vote and Electoral College victory.
Whatever you think about Bernie Sanders as a potential president, it is wrong to dismiss his chances of winning the office. Not only does most of the available empirical evidence show Mr. Sanders defeating President Trump in the national popular vote and in the critical Midwestern states that tipped the Electoral College in 2016, but his specific electoral strengths align with changes in the composition of the country’s population in ways that could actually make..."
"As new CNN head Chris Licht looks to revamp a network that has lost its way, he has one thing working in his favor: The ""news"" network at this point couldn't possibly get worse.

"Is Biden running?
He says he is.
Earlier this month, the 79-year-old president rejected the idea that a large majority of his own party's voters don't want him on the ballot in 2024 when a reporter cited poll numbers that showed only 26 percent of Democrats want Biden to be the nominee.

"What's the matter with America? That seems to be the burning question on the tongues of many liberals in the wake of Donald Trump's stunning upset victory over Hillary Clinton. And in a way, that question is a mash-up response to two popular theories on America's political landscape, the first laid out in Thomas Frank's What's the Matter with Kansas?, and the second in The Emerging Democratic Majority by John Judis and Ruy Teixera. These books offer a clear window into how liberals understand not only the broad political landscape,..."

And he is still the front-runner, until someone can prove otherwise.
Far from perfect, and rarely exactly steady, Mr. Biden nonetheless achieved at least some of the goals that seemed..."
"(CNN) - As many of America's cities burn and our democracy feels like it's unraveling, attacks on Confederate monuments in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis may seem incongruous to those who believe that these protests are only about what happened there.

"(CNN) -- One need not listen hard these days to hear the sound of Democratic pollsters and pundits gleefully cheering that the end of President Donald Trump's term in power is finally in sight -- Joe Biden's Inauguration Day on January 20th, 2021.
Such Democratic groupthink goes as follows: the Covid-19 pandemic has killed more than 130,000 Americans and shows no signs of letting up; the economy has been plunged into the deepest recession in decades; and amid ongoing protests in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, Democrats are fired..."
"WASHINGTON – Joe Biden can look at the polls and smile.
Cautiously.
A double-digit advantage in numerous national surveys, solid leads in a number of battlegrounds and competitive showings in states Donald Trump carried handily in 2016 suggest the presumptive Democratic nominee is the favorite to win in November.
The overwhelming majority of polls four years ago indicated Trump would lose as well. So why put much faith in the 2020 polls that show the former vice president consistently on top?
David Burgess of Kittery, Maine, said he stopped believing..."
"Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal Title X family planning program rather than comply with new Trump administration rules regarding abortion counseling.
The new rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year, prohibit Title X grantees from providing or referring patients for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency.
""The Trump administration has forced Planned Parenthood grantees out of Title X,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood's acting president, in a conference call Monday. ""The impact of the Trump administration's gag..."
"But while those high-profile abortion bans make their way through the courts — they were designed to provoke legal challenges that could threaten Roe v. Wade — a more immediate threat to women’s health care has been brewing. The Trump administration has quietly been working to gut the Title X family planning program, which helps poor women afford birth control, cancer screenings and testing for H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted infections. On Monday, the administration’s efforts paid off: Planned Parenthood, which serves about 40 percent of Title X patients around..."
"Making an already head-splittingly difficult deal on the fiscal cliff even harder to resolve is a set of three rules by which the Republicans who run the House play. These are not official regulations; they're more shibboleths that House GOP leaders have adopted in recent years. And those rules are leaving House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, little room to maneuver as lawmakers try to avoid a set of tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the end of the year."
"Former president Donald Trump will visit the U.S.-Mexico border here Wednesday, joining Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and a group of congressional Republicans for a trip that will fuel Trump's attacks on the Biden administration over its immigration policies.
The trip is part of the former president’s efforts to ramp up his political activity ahead of the 2022 midterms, where he is looking to settle scores against political opponents and position himself for a potential run for president in 2024.
The border visit in particular offers Trump the opportunity to..."
"CNN will host a seven-hour marathon of interviews with 10 presidential candidates about climate change on Wednesday beginning at 5 pm Eastern as part of its climate crisis town hall. A live stream of the town hall will air on CNN.com. You can also stream it via CNN apps on iOS, Android, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast, and Android TV. The forum will also be broadcast on SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, and the Westwood One Radio Network."
"President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., inheriting a collection of crises unlike any in generations, plans to open his administration with dozens of executive directives on top of expansive legislative proposals in a 10-day blitz meant to signal a turning point for a nation reeling from disease, economic turmoil, racial strife and now the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol.
Mr. Biden’s team has developed a raft of decrees that he can issue on his own authority after the inauguration on Wednesday to begin reversing some of President Trump’s most..."
"The Federal Trade Commission has filed an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook, alleging that the company violated federal antitrust laws with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The new complaint is a more detailed version of a charge dismissed by the court in June for insufficient evidence.
“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for US personal social networking services,” the complaint alleges, citing time spent and active-user metrics on the daily and monthly scale. “Individually and collectively, these metrics provide significant evidence of Facebook’s..."
"The state of the Republican Party can be summed up by the glaring contrast between its convention and the conduct of professional athletes on Wednesday who refused to ignore the shooting of yet another Black man, Jacob Blake, coupled with the arrest of an alleged White shooter who killed two people during demonstrations in Kenosha, Wis.
President Trump did not reach out to Blake’s family nor denounce the killings during the protests, allegedly by a 17-year-old who attended a Trump rally and reveled in the Blue Lives Matter rhetoric Trump..."
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin on Sunday defended his decision to vote against a sweeping voting rights bill and reiterated his opposition to gutting the filibuster, declaring in the strongest terms yet that he is not willing to change Senate rules to help his party push through much of President Joe Biden's agenda.
""I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy, and for that reason, I will vote against the For the People Act. Furthermore, I will not vote to weaken or eliminate the filibuster,"" Manchin, a moderate Democrat..."
"President Trump is throwing his support behind Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his immigration legislation, as the debate over immigration reform continues to play out on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump released a statement, urging the Senate to support Grassley's bill and oppose bills that ""fail to deliver for the American people."""
"CBS Corporation announced on Sunday that chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves is departing the company, effective immediately. Moonves' exit comes hours after The New Yorker published accounts from six women with allegations of sexual assault or misconduct, following allegations by six other women in July."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law Tuesday a policy banning transgender athletes from playing girls and women’s sports that opponents have condemned as deeply discriminatory against transgender athletes and students.
Dubbed the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act,” Florida’s new law establishes that women’s sports from middle school through college, including intramurals and club teams, are closed to males based on the biological sex listed on a student’s birth certificate. The measure has been widely celebrated by Republicans for “protecting the integrity” of girls athletics. Florida joined more than 20 other..."
"Steve Jobs, the co-founder and former CEO of Apple, has been awarded a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden, the White House announced Friday. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest US honor that can be given to a civilian, and it’s presented to “individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said in a statement.
Jobs founded Apple in April 1976, and it’s since become one of..."
"President Joe Biden will present the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to 17 people, including actor Denzel Washington, gymnast Simone Biles and the late John McCain, the Arizona Republican with whom Biden served in the U.S. Senate.
Biden will also recognize Sandra Lindsay, the New York City nurse who rolled up her sleeve on live television in December 2020 to receive the first COVID-19 vaccine dose that was pumped into an arm in the United States, the White House announced Friday.
Biden’s honors list, which the White House shared first with The..."
"To the list of things former President Barack Obama did that President Donald Trump is undoing, go ahead and add Cuba.
Two and a half years ago, Obama, with great fanfare, announced an easing of the decades-long travel and trade restrictions on the island nation’s authoritarian regime, arguing that the policies had not worked and were only punishing ordinary Cubans.
At a speech Friday afternoon in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, Trump is expected to reverse at least some of Obama’s changes, despite public opinion nationally and even among Cuban-Americans that..."
"Vice President Joe Biden says if Congress won't act on gun control, he'll fight for a new Congress.
Biden is unveiling two new steps President Barack Obama is taking on gun violence. The executive actions don't require approval from Congress, where gun legislation collapsed earlier this year.
One new step will curb the import of military surplus weapons. The Obama administration is also proposing to close a loophole that lets certain weapons be registered to corporations without background checks.
Biden says the steps a"
"Mikhail Gorbachev -- the last leader of the former Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991 -- has died at the age of 91.
Gorbachev died after a long illness, Russian state news agencies reported.
""Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev died this evening after a severe and prolonged illness,"" the Central Clinical Hospital said, according to RIA Novosti Tuesday.
The man credited with introducing key political and economic reforms to the USSR and helping to end the Cold War had been in failing health for some time.
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences,..."
"President Joe Biden is set to announce that he’s shaving about two weeks off his May 1 deadline for states to make all adults eligible for coronavirus vaccines.
A White House official confirms Biden plans to announce that every adult in the U.S. will be eligible to be vaccinated by April 19. Biden will make the announcement at the White House on Tuesday following a visit to a vaccination site in Virginia.
States have been gradually expanding eligibility beyond such priority groups as seniors and essential front-line workers.
Biden announced..."
"Police clad in riot gear and wielding batons began dispersing a crowd of Donald Trump supporters and protesters here Friday night after the presumptive GOP nominee held a rally.
After issuing orders to the crowd of roughly 1,000 to disperse, police began forcefully and aggressively pushing protesters, checking them with their batons. At least 35 people were arrested"
"The Justice Department said Sunday it will review the law enforcement response to the Texas school shooting, an unusual federal look back prompted by questions about the shifting and at times contradictory information from authorities that have enraged a community in shock and sorrow.
Department spokesman Anthony Coley said the review would be conducted in a fair, impartial and independent manner and the findings would be made public. The announcement came as President Joe Biden was visiting Uvalde, where he and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects at a memorial to the 19 students..."
"With the drop dead date approaching, President Donald Trump’s most ardent backers in Congress are turning to increasingly more desperate measures to keep Vice President Mike Pence from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory on Jan. 6. Now, one die-hard MAGA booster in the House is going so far as to sue the vice president in a last-ditch effort to keep him from carrying out his Constitutional duty.
In a federal lawsuit filed in Texas Monday morning, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) joined a group of 11 other plaintiffs suing the vice..."
"If Hillary Clinton’s die-hard opponents were hoping for an October surprise, they’re going to have to wait.
A Tuesday morning press conference by WikiLeaks, which Clinton antagonists and conspiracy theorists had hoped would spell the beginning of the end of her presidential campaign, turned out to be a celebration-cum-infomercial for the website, which celebrates its 10th anniversary today and is promoting a new book."
"It was billed as the #OctoberSurprise, the moment when WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange might reveal the damaging, campaign-ending information he'd obtained about Hillary Clinton. It couldn't come a moment too soon, as a wave of post-debate polling found Clinton regaining a lead over Donald Trump. Early Tuesday, the pro-Trump conspiracy site Infowars launched a live stream to watch Assange's “WikiLeaks 10"" anniversary news conference; readers of the Drudge Report, which the day before had led with a story about a man who claims to be the son of Bill Clinton,..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is sticking with its crowd-friendly waiver of entrance fees at national parks during the coronavirus pandemic, as managers at some parks try and fail to keep visitors a safe distance apart and communities appeal for a shutdown at other parks that are still open.
While the Interior Department agreed this week to requests from local managers of Yellowstone and some other iconic national parks to close, others remained open and newly free of charge. In Arizona, local governments and the Navajo Nation were waiting..."
"Two days before he cursed a supervisor and quit the National Park Service job he loved, Dustin Stone arrived to work in a foul mood. A decision by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to keep national park sites open despite the coronavirus outbreak left him angry and in disbelief.
The virus hasn’t reached Skagway, a tiny town on the Alaskan panhandle where Stone lives and worked at the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. But if it does, he said, it could be a disaster. “I’ve lived here year-round through eight..."
"The Biden administration on Wednesday invoked a wartime tool, the Defense Production Act, in an effort to address the nationwide shortage of baby formula. Its use of the law, which Congress passed in the early days of the Korean War, reflects the magnitude of the supply crunch that has left many parents scrambling for formula.
Supply chain disruptions tied to the coronavirus pandemic have fueled shortages of a wide range of consumer goods, but a recall on formula produced at an Abbott plant in Michigan exacerbated the shortfall. A majority of American parents and..."
"Capitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after he confronted rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection, the District’s chief medical examiner has ruled.
The ruling, released Monday, will make it difficult for prosecutors to pursue homicide charges in the officer’s death. Two men are accused of assaulting Sicknick by spraying a powerful chemical irritant at him during the siege, but prosecutors have not tied that exposure to Sicknick’s death."
"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday paved the way for children ages 5 to 11 to get Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.
The FDA cleared kid-size doses — just a third of the amount given to teens and adults — for emergency use, and up to 28 million more American children could be eligible for vaccinations as early as next week.
One more regulatory hurdle remains: On Tuesday, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make more detailed recommendations on which youngsters should get vaccinated, with a final..."
"The US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization on Friday for Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11. This is the first Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the United States for younger children.
The FDA's vaccine advisers voted 17-0 with one abstention on Tuesday to recommend EUA for the vaccine, which is formulated at one-third the dose of the vaccine used for people 12 and older.
Pfizer says a clinical trial showed its vaccine provides more than 90% protection against symptomatic disease among children, even at one-third the dose, and..."
"Merrick Garland has been confirmed as America’s top law enforcement officer, a boost for Joe Biden’s drive against racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.
Garland’s rise to attorney general, approved 70-30 by the US Senate in a strongly bipartisan vote, turns the page on former president Donald Trump’s harsh “law and order” rhetoric and efforts to bend the justice department to his will.
It also marks a poignant second chance for the 68-year-old judge who, nominated to the supreme court by then president Barack Obama in 2016, was denied..."
"The Senate on Thursday night passed the most sweeping gun bill in decades designed to prevent gun violence, a major victory for advocates and a rare defeat for the National Rifle Association.
The vote was 65 to 33, with all 50 Democratic members and 15 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, voting to send the bill to the House.
“The United States Senate is doing something many believed was impossible even a few weeks ago. We are passing the first significant gun safety bill in nearly 30 years,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer,..."
"For years Wall Street has sprinkled money all across U.S. politics to make and keep friends in Washington. Now, it’s rethinking the consequences.
After the deadly siege on Capitol Hill last week, major banks are reassessing, reducing and in many cases suspending their campaign contributions. Some are vowing to pull back from candidates who appeared to support the attempted insurrection.
The moves represent a sharp break with the past and come as leaders across corporate America are rushing to distance themselves from President Donald Trump. Big business largely embraced Trump’s..."
"The Justice Department, as soon as Tuesday, is expected to ask US attorneys appointed by former President Donald Trump to submit their resignations, a turnover expected to spare two top prosecutors in Delaware and Connecticut overseeing two sensitive Trump-era investigations, a senior Justice Department official said.
In a call Monday night, acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson asked Delaware US Attorney David Weiss to remain in office, where he is overseeing the tax probe of Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son. John Durham, appointed as special counsel by former Attorney General..."
"The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, felling one of the most significant remaining racial barriers in American government and sending the first Democratic nominee to the high court in 12 years.
Jackson, a daughter of schoolteachers who has risen steadily through America’s elite legal ranks, will become the first Black woman to sit on the court and only the eighth who is not a White man. She will replace Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer after the Supreme Court’s term ends in late June or early..."
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested on Friday that the Obama administration should toss the court system and Constitution out the window when handling the missing suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. In a series of tweets that came hours after it was revealed that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the suspect at large in the Boston marathon bombings is a United States citizen Graham urged the Obama administration to nevertheless consider treating him as an enemy combatant.
"Donald Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, on Saturday blamed ""thugs"" for his decision to cancel a rally in Chicago over alleged security concerns and said the activists had ""totally energized America.""
The Chicago Police Department said on that four men and a woman were arrested at the rally after brief scuffles broke out at the event at the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion."
"President Joe Biden on Thursday announced he is taking executive action to pardon Americans who've been convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law.
The action will benefit 6,500 people with prior federal convictions and thousands of others charged under the District of Columbia's criminal code, according to senior administration officials.
""No one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana,"" Biden said in a statement outlining the administration's new actions. ""Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct..."
"Last week, NBC News highlighted a specific plan crafted by congressional Republican leaders: As the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings unfolded, the GOP would focus its attention on entirely different issues and treat the investigation as an irrelevant sideshow, unworthy of ferocious pushback.
Either Donald Trump didn’t hear about the plan, or he decided not to care about it.
We saw some of this last week, when the former president publicly took issue with Ivanka Trump’s committee testimony. Yesterday, as The New York Times noted, the Republican went even further: “He continued repeating his election conspiracies..."
"The NSA is gearing up to collect millions of Americans telephone metadata -- again. Just two days after the agency shut down that program when the Patriot Act provision that authorized it expired Sunday at midnight, the Senate restored those authorities, allowing the government to reinstate bulk data collection -- for the next six months. How? By passing the USA Freedom Act, the bill intended to end that very program."
"A new deadline for a political framework agreement for Iran's Nuclear talks has been set for March 1, 2015, a Western diplomat tells CNN on Monday, with a deadline for final agreement including annexes on July 1.
Negotiators had been scrambling to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear program before a Monday night deadline. The negotiators included representatives from Iran and the P5+1 countries -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain), plus Germany.
The parties involved will..."
"Hours away from a Monday deadline for completing a new accord to curb Iran’s nuclear program, negotiators planned to extend talks for another seven months, a Western diplomat said.
The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, told reporters that “some significant progress” had been made but did not provide details. He confirmed that the goal was to reach a “headline” agreement by March 1 and that the talks would continue through June.
The negotiations are to resume next month. The location for the December talks has yet to be announced, but..."
"The Senate majority leader is courting moderates, channeling progressives and keeping a GOP channel open. It might not be enough.
Shortly before Chuck Schumer cued up a vote on the teetering bipartisan infrastructure agreement reached by five of his centrists, he gathered them all in person for a gut check.
The Senate majority leader wanted to explain his thinking in greater detail to the Democrats who’ve labored to cut a nearly $600 billion deal with Republicans, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. He needed to make sure everyone..."
"Sen. Cory Gardner was blunt in 2016 about why he thought a Supreme Court seat should stay vacant despite then-President Barack Obama's demand to fill it.
""The next election is too soon, and the stakes too high,"" Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, said in March of that year.
Asked on Wednesday about his 2016 comments, amid President Donald Trump's effort to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat less than two months before an election, Gardner didn't answer when approached by CNN.
""If you didn't see my statement, I'll..."
"The number of murders in the United States jumped by nearly 30 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year in the largest single-year increase ever recorded in the country, according to official FBI statistics released Monday.
The data show 21,570 homicides in the U.S. in 2020, which is a staggering 4,901 more than in 2019. The tally makes clear — in concrete terms — just how violent last year was.
The overall violent crime rate, which includes murder, assault, robbery and rape, inched up around 5 percent, while property..."
"The United States experienced its biggest one-year increase on record in murders in 2020, according to new figures released Monday by the F.B.I., with some cities hitting record highs.
Although major crimes were down overall, an additional 4,901 murders were committed in 2020 compared with the year before, the largest leap since national records started in 1960. The significant rise in homicides has roughly coincided with the 18 months of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The high murder rate has continued into 2021, although the pace has slowed as the year has..."
"At the U.S. Supreme Court, the long-awaited showdown over the rights of LGBTQ employees is center stage. On Tuesday, the justices hear a set of cases testing whether the federal law that bars sex discrimination in employment applies to LGBTQ employees.
Specifically, the question is whether employers are free to fire employees because they are gay or transgender."
"The Supreme Court was hearing arguments Tuesday in two of the term's most closely watched cases over whether federal civil rights law protects LGBTQ people from job discrimination. The cases are the court's first on LGBTQ rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement and replacement by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
A decision is expected by early summer 2020, amid the presidential election campaign. The issue is whether a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that bars discrimination in employment because of sex covers LGBTQ people."
"President Biden said Sunday that the United States is looking into what vaccines might be available to protect people against monkeypox, saying that “everybody” should be concerned as cases continue to spread around the world and some countries beef up their treatment stockpiles.
“We’re working on it hard to figure out what we do and what vaccine if any might be available for it,” Biden said from South Korea, where he is on an official visit.
Biden said the recent spread of monkeypox infections — identified by the World Health Organization in at..."
"Conservatives are accusing President Biden of hypocrisy after he announced travel restrictions against eight African countries.
During the 2020 campaign, critics noted, Biden accused former President Donald Trump of racism and xenophobia for enacting similar travel bans.
Despite the way it is being framed in some outlets, however, the tweet embedded below does not actually address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Instead, it was posted in response to a Trump administration policy that would make it more difficult for citizens of Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, and Kyrgyzstan to obtain immigrant visas. When asked..."
"The dispatches began routinely enough for an out-of-the-ordinary day, with Pool Report #2 from Cheryl Bolen, the Bloomberg White House reporter on pool duty Saturday.
“Pool took vans over to Walter Reed, arriving at 10:31 a.m. We are attempting to learn the logistics of Dr. [Sean] Conley’s update on POTUS’s health, scheduled for 11:00 a.m., and will advise soonest.” The report, sent at 10:33 a.m., was a typical transmission from the email list that provides regular updates each day on the president’s activities and is, at the most basic level,..."
"Eight U.S. troops diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) arrived in the U.S. on Friday, according to Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman.
Hoffman said those troops are among a total of 34 American servicemembers diagnosed with TBI after the al Asad airbase where they were stationed in Iraq was hit by missiles fired by Iran on Jan. 8. The attack was in reprisal for a U.S. drone strike Jan. 3 that killed top Iranian general Qassed Soleimani.
It was at least the third time U.S. officials have had to revise President..."
"The Pentagon on Friday said 34 U.S. troops have been diagnosed with concussions or traumatic brain injury following an Iranian missile attack this month, more than triple the number originally reported and coming just days after President Donald Trump downplayed the injuries as “headaches.”
Chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman also told reporters that Defense Secretary Mark Esper had ordered the Pentagon’s acting personnel chief, Matt Donovan, to review the department’s procedures for tracking and reporting injuries.
Trump initially said no one was harmed during the Jan. 8 Iranian ballistic missile..."
"Jimmy Galligan was in history class last school year when his phone buzzed with a message. Once he clicked on it, he found a three-second video of a white classmate looking into the camera and uttering an anti-Black racial slur.
The slur, he said, was regularly hurled in classrooms and hallways throughout his years in the Loudoun County school district. He had brought the issue up to teachers and administrators but, much to his anger and frustration, his complaints had gone nowhere.
So he held on to the video, which..."
"While it's unlikely anyone can say with certainty what were the origins of America’s Memorial Day, it is generally accepted that the custom of decorating graves in remembrance of the war dead began after the Civil War, among families of fallen Confederate soldiers. But the historian David W. Blight makes an argument that the first such observance was in fact the work of newly freed Black people seeking to honor the 40,000 African American soldiers who died in the war. The tribute consisted of elaborate ceremonies, parades, prayers, scripture readings and speeches. The Black soldiers deserved the..."
"One US Capitol Police officer has died and another is injured after a suspect rammed a vehicle into a police barricade outside the Capitol building Friday afternoon, the department's acting chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters during a press briefing roughly two hours after initial reports of the attack first surfaced.
The officer was identified by Pittman later Friday as Officer William ""Billy"" Evans, an 18-year veteran of the force and a member of its ""First Responders Unit.""
""It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the..."
"The Justice Department announced on Sunday that it was replacing the legal team defending the Trump administration’s effort to place a citizenship question on the next census, a change that is all but unprecedented in legal battles as consequential as the one over the 2020 head count.
The department said in a statement that it was “shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward.” It offered no explanation for the en masse change, which came on the heels of an extraordinary week in a yearlong..."
"The Department of Justice announced Sunday that a new team of Civil Division lawyers will take over handling of all 2020 census-related questions.
The changing of hands comes as President Donald Trump continues to push for the addition of a controversial citizenship question to the census, which takes place every 10 years.
A statement from DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not reveal why the change was made, but stated that the lawyers who have represented the United States in these cases so far ""have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism,..."
"As President Joe Biden embarked on only his second overseas trip, he started with a personally poignant audience with Pope Francis on Friday, the first time in more than half a century that a Roman Catholic U.S. leader has met at the Vatican with the head of the Catholic Church.
The White House said the private meeting lasted about 90 minutes, unusually long.
Overshadowing the meeting was criticism from conservative U.S. bishops over Biden's public, political position on abortion, some arguing Biden and others who share his views should be denied Communion."
"Iran has also seized a second tanker, the Liberian-flagged MV Mesdar, according to a US official. Two more US officials tell CNN that, according to maritime intelligence reports, the indication is the Mesdar has been seized.
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced earlier that its navy has captured a British-flagged tanker ‘Stena Impero’ in the Strait of Hormuz.
The order of seizure of the two ships isn’t clear at this time."
"President Donald Trump plans to resume the transfer of surplus weapons, vehicles and other equipment from the nation’s military to its state and local law enforcement agencies, reviving a program that was sharply curtailed by President Barack Obama two years ago. The program launched in 1990 but was greatly limited after public reaction to images of heavily militarized police in the streets of Ferguson, Mo., and other sites of civil unrest."
"Plans for Nancy Pelosi, the US House speaker, to visit Taiwan have prompted opposition from China and the American military but support from Republicans in Washington, including former members of the Trump administration.
Trump’s second secretary of defense, Mark Esper, told CNN: “I think if the speaker wants to go, she should go.”
Mike Pompeo, Trump’s second secretary of state, tweeted: “Nancy, I’ll go with you. I’m banned in China, but not freedom-loving Taiwan. See you there!”
No date has been set for a Pelosi visit to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing..."
"In his address to an elite, invitation-only Washington foreign policy audience Wednesday, Donald Trump promised that, as president, he would restore a “coherent” vision to America’s role in the world.
But across the ideological spectrum, and even among natural allies, Trump’s speech received a failing grade for coherence and drew snickering and scorn from foreign policy insiders who remain unconvinced that Trump is up to the job."
"Following the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, advocates for privacy and reproductive health have expressed fears that data from period-tracking apps could be used to find people who’ve had abortions.
They have a point. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the federal patient privacy law known as HIPAA, does not apply to most apps that track menstrual cycles, just as it doesn’t apply to many health care apps and at-home test kits.
In 2015, ProPublica reported how HIPAA, passed in 1996, has not kept up with changes in technology and does not cover at-home paternity..."
"Democracy itself is on the ballot in 2022.
Not only do we have candidates who have questioned the 2020 election or refuse to say they will accept defeat this year, but numerous states and localities also will vote on measures to change how elections are run or who may vote in them. The outcomes of those ballot measures could have a significant impact on the health of American democracy moving forward.
A few states will determine whether to make voting easier. Connecticut will decide whether to amend its state constitution..."
"In a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day, President Trump railed against “cancel culture” and the left’s supposed wholesale embrace of totalitarianism (err, “toe-tally-terrio-tism”). He accused his political opponents of “shaming dissenters and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees,” arguing that such behavior has “absolutely no place in the United States of America.”
Unfortunately, no other American has spent more time, energy and (taxpayer) resources trying to cancel dissent and enforce submission than Trump. Here are just a few of the ways that Trump..."
"Facing an increasingly narrow path to the nomination and failing to thwart Donald Trump’s dominance, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) withdrew from the 2016 presidential race on Tuesday.
“Tonight, I’m sorry to say that path has been foreclosed,” Cruz said in a speech Tuesday night in Indianapolis, “but the voters chose another path.”"
"The IRS sent stimulus checks to more than 1 million people who had died because it initially believed it did not have the legal authority to withhold them, according to an independent watchdog.
The administration later reversed itself, and began trying to block payments going to the dead while asking survivors to return those that did slip through, the Government Accountability Office said in an analysis released Thursday.
The report does not say what prompted the agency to reverse course, when it decided to change direction or who made the..."
"The U.S.’s top uniformed military officer called China’s suspected test of a hypersonic weapons system a “very concerning” development in the escalating competition between Washington and Beijing. 
“What we saw was a very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system. And it is very concerning,” General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview for “The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations” on Bloomberg Television. “I don’t know if it’s quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it’s very close to that. It..."
"Students at several Loudoun County Public Schools held 10-minute walkouts Tuesday morning to demand the county protect students from sexual assault and to declare solidarity with survivors.
At Broad Run High School in Ashburn, dozens of students walked out of their classrooms midmorning to demand the county make the public schools safer spaces. “We deserve to be safe,” one student standing in front of the main entrance shouted.

"Michael Bloomberg has finally decided to run for president, after a years-long game of will-he-or-won’t-he.
On Sunday, the 77-year-old billionaire philanthropist, media magnate, and former New York City mayor officially announced he will campaign to win the White House in the Democratic primary. Earlier this month, rumblings began that Bloomberg would finally pull the trigger after he started to register to get on the ballot in multiple states. He further fueled speculation when he apologized on November 17 for his mayoral administration’s stop-and-frisk policy, after declining to do so for..."
"Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced he is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, offering his own mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.
Bloomberg, 77, called Trump “an existential threat to our country and our values” as he joined a crowded field of candidates, with fewer than three months before the Iowa caucuses. His late entry will create added difficulties as he seeks to build a campaign infrastructure and support in key states.

"The terrorist group Islamic State released a video Tuesday apparently depicting the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.
It was the second video of a beheading released by the group in recent weeks..
Sotloff, kneeling in an orange jumpsuit, says he is ""paying the price"" for the U.S. intervention in Iraq with his life.
""You've spent billions of U.S. taxpayers dollars and we've lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State,"" Sotfloff says. ""So where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?""
Moments later,..."
"A new video attributed to the Islamic State terrorist organization purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, marking the second such execution in recent weeks by a group that controls parts of Iraq and Syria and has threatened to kill other captives.
The video shows a bound Sotloff being held at knifepoint by a black-clad militant against a desert backdrop that appears similar to the one shown in a video released last month depicting the beheading of American journalist James Foley. The video was obtained by the..."
"Democrat Katie Hobbs will win Arizona’s governor’s race, CNN projects, defeating one of the most prominent defenders of former President Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.
Calling the 2020 election rigged, Republican Kari Lake had repeatedly said she would not have certified Joe Biden’s win in Arizona in 2020. Hobbs, as Arizona’s secretary of state, had rejected GOP lies about the election.
Lake’s defeat follows the defeat of two other high-profile election deniers in the state – Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters and secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem.

"Hundreds of far-right protesters and anti-fascist counter-demonstrators swarmed downtown Portland, Oregon, on Saturday for a long-hyped rally that attracted President Donald Trump’s attention and resulted in at least 13 arrests.
Police seized metal poles, bear spray and other weapons and closed bridges and streets to try to keep the rival groups apart. They were largely successful. Six minor injuries were reported."
"Fox News, right-wing websites and Republican lawmakers are promoting a new false flag conspiracy that the FBI orchestrated the deadly assault on the US Capitol.
The haywire theory originated from an article published Monday by Revolver News, a right-wing website. From there, it was picked up by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who used his opening segment on Tuesday night to slam the FBI, saying it played a role in the January 6 attack.
Several Republican lawmakers quickly piled on. They entered the article into the congressional record, tweeted about the Fox..."
"During his Fox News primetime show on June 15, 2021, host Tucker Carlson launched into a diatribe accusing the FBI of orchestrating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. His basis? Charging documents in criminal cases cite “unindicted co-conspirators.”
“What does that mean? Well, it means that in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives,” Carlson asserted. This comment may have been stated as fact, but it is in fact flimsy, when scrutinized, which we will do below.
Carlson cited a report on the website Revolver.news, an opaque, pro-Trump site that regularly promotes media..."
"Just as a worrying new variant of the coronavirus has begun to spread, the Federal Reserve chair signaled on Tuesday that the central bank could reduce its support for the economy more quickly, sending a shudder through Wall Street and pushing the S&P 500 negative for November.
A sell-off already in progress accelerated after the chair, Jerome H. Powell, told a Senate committee that inflation was likely to persist well into next year and that the Fed would consider tapering off its purchases of government bonds “perhaps a few months sooner” than..."

“A misdemeanor complaint was filed in Albany City Court against the former governor this afternoon,” said the spokesman, Lucian Chalfen.
The complaint came more than two months after Brittany Commisso, a former aide to Mr. Cuomo, filed a criminal complaint against him with the Albany County sheriff’s office. She accused him of groping her breast while they were alone in his..."
"Ronan Farrow made his first TV appearance Friday since excerpts from his upcoming book, ""Catch and Kill,"" revealed new details surrounding Matt Lauer's 2017 firing.
Farrow, on ""Good Morning America,"" told George Stephanopoulos he stands by his book, which is out next week, despite Lauer calling the reporting in ""Catch and Kill"" false and defamatory. While on the morning show, Farrow also alleged there were previous accusations brought to NBC regarding Lauer's conduct, prior to the 2017 complaint that led to his ouster."
"In a meeting with NBC officials in November 2017, former NBC News producer Brooke Nevils ""unambiguously"" described being raped by former ""Today"" host Matt Lauer without explicitly using that term, investigative journalist Ronan Farrow said in a television interview Friday.
The claim is included in ""Catch and Kill,"" an upcoming book by Farrow that documents his reporting on movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and other prominent men who are accused of attacking and harassing women. NBC News has not seen a copy of the book, slated to be released on Tuesday."
"The Trump administration has executed Brandon Bernard, after the US supreme court denied a last-minute request to delay his killing. Bernard’s execution is one of five that the Trump administration is rushing through before Joe Biden takes office.
The execution on Thursday night was the ninth federal execution since since July, when Donald Trump ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions, and the first during a presidential lame-duck period in 130 years.
Bernard’s legal team had requested that the court grant them an additional two weeks to build up a..."
"Georgia election officials have released a report on the hand tally recount of the presidential election, affirming that Joe Biden maintains his lead in the state.
The full hand recount of the state's 5 million presidential votes resulted in a narrowing of Biden's lead over President Trump in Georgia, but not nearly enough to change the result.
The recount, formally known as a risk-limiting audit, is intended to verify the contest's winner. As GPB's Stephen Fowler reported, four counties uncovered a few thousand previously uncounted votes, which subsequently cut into..."
"A top Georgia elections official says a hand tally of the presidential race in Georgia is complete, and the results affirm Democrat Joe Biden’s lead over Republican President Donald Trump. Gabriel Sterling released the information to The Associated Press on Thursday. The hand recount of nearly 5 million votes stemmed from an audit required by a new state law and wasn’t in response to any suspected problems with the state’s results or an official recount request. The state has until Friday to certify the results that have been certified and..."
"Since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown, we've been forced to do without the ""non-essentials"". How exactly you define that phrase varies from country to country, person to person – in Canada, weed is deemed essential; in the UK, police had to apologise for patrolling what they decided were ""non-essential"" supermarket aisles – but it has brought to light questions about what will be deemed necessary after The Great Pause.
It's in the world of work that these questions could have the greatest impact. If you can do your job..."
"Following a historic meeting between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the leaders appeared side by side to make an extraordinary announcement: The two nations — technically in a state of war for more than six decades — would work toward a permanent peace treaty and the elimination of nuclear weapons from the peninsula."
"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women, including current and former government workers, breaking state and federal laws and engaging in a pattern of unwanted touching and inappropriate comments, according to a much anticipated report from the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, released on Tuesday.
The 165-page report said that Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, and his aides cultivated a toxic work culture in his office that was rife with fear and intimidation, and helped enable “harassment to occur and created a hostile work environment.”
The report included..."
"An investigation found that Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women in and out of state government and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers, New York’s attorney general announced Tuesday in a finding that quickly renewed calls for the Democrat’s resignation or impeachment.
The nearly five-month investigation found that Cuomo’s administration was a “hostile work environment” and was “rife with fear and intimidation.” The probe, conducted by two outside lawyers, involved interviews with 179 people including Cuomo’s accusers, current and former administration employees and the governor himself.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) acknowledged Tuesday that her support of a pay raise for members of Congress is “not a fun or politically popular position to take.”
But the freshman lawmaker explained in a thread on Twitter why she believed the idea of curbing pay increases for politicians “may sound nice,” but it “only increases pressure on them to keep dark money loopholes open.”"
"The bipartisan infrastructure deal senators brokered with President Joe Biden is hanging precariously ahead of a crucial Wednesday test vote as senators struggle over how to pay for nearly $1 trillion in public works spending.
Tensions were rising Tuesday as Republicans prepared to block the vote, mounting a filibuster over what they see as a rushed and misguided process. With Biden preparing to hit the road to rally support for his big infrastructure ideas — including some $3.5 trillion in a follow up bill — restless Democrats say it’s time to at least start..."
"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that a vote on a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security will happen Tuesday.
A clean bill to fully fund the Department through the end of the fiscal year is what Democrats have been demanding, and conservatives have been fighting against.
According to multiple GOP members and aides, House Speaker John Boehner announced to members at the top of House GOP conference meeting that he was out of options, and the Senate couldn't pass their bill.
He asked if anyone..."
"The House will finally vote on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security without immigration measures, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told his conference at a meeting on Tuesday.
The vote will come after the House narrowly averted a shutdown last Friday when the House GOP rejected a ""clean"" DHS funding bill passed in the Senate, and then 52 conservative Republican members joined Democrats to block even a three-week continuing resolution. The House passed a one-week funding bill in hopes that Senate Democrats would allow a conference between the..."
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday urged a global minimum tax rate on corporations in a push to assert U.S. leadership in ongoing international tax negotiations.
The goal is to prevent companies from relocating wherever they find lower taxes.
“Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth and prosperity,” Yellen said in her first major speech since becoming Treasury secretary.

"Washington -- The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine delivered a ""damning"" 15-page opening statement on Capitol Hill on Tuesday alleging a direct link between a delay in U.S. military aid for Ukraine and the country's willingness to investigate President Trump's political foes.
William Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Kiev, is a key witness in the investigation into the Ukraine scandal at the center of the impeachment probe. In messages with other diplomats from August and September released earlier this month, Taylor raised concerns about the U.S. withholding hundreds of..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former U.S. Ambassador William Taylor provided lawmakers Tuesday with a vivid, detailed and what some called a “disturbing” account of the way President Donald Trump wanted to put the new Ukraine president “in a public box” by demanding the quid pro quo at the center of the impeachment probe.
In a lengthy opening statement to House investigators, Taylor described Trump’s demand that “everything” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wanted, including vital military aid to counter Russia, hinged on making a public vow that he would investigate Democrats going..."
"Rather than take responsibility for their losses, Republicans have seized on a new state law that allows third parties to collect and turn in other people’s mail ballots to explain why they were so badly defeated in California races on Nov. 6.
According to the conspiracy theories being spouted by Republican leaders and then repeated in the internet echo chamber, the new law allowed Democrats to steal GOP seats in Orange County by sending campaign workers door to door, collecting thousands of mail ballots from guileless voters and doing who..."
"A Tuesday incident in which certain websites briefly vanished from Google search results may have inadvertently exposed an internal list aimed at suppressing certain news outlets, a former engineer for the company said.
“It appears to have revealed the existence of another blacklist that disproportionately targets conservatives,” Mike Wacker theorized in a message to Mediaite. “The glitch is that sites on this blacklist disappeared from Google search results, but the existence of the list is very much by design. And that raises a major question: Why was this blacklist created..."
"President Biden vigorously defended his decision to end America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan on Thursday, asserting that the United States can no longer afford the human cost or strategic distraction of a conflict that he said had strayed far from its initial mission.
Speaking after the withdrawal of nearly all U.S. combat forces and as the Taliban surge across the country, Mr. Biden, often in blunt and defensive tones, spoke directly to critics of his order to bring an end to American participation in a conflict born from the terrorist..."
"Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took his protest of the Iran nuclear agreement to the U.S. airwaves on Sunday.
""This deal will both threaten us and threaten our neighbors,"" Netanyahu said on CNN's State of the Union.

The Israeli leader spoke days after the U.S., allies"
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the framework agreement reached by world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program, repeatedly calling it a ""free path to a bomb"" that will spark an arms race in the Middle East.
Under the framework announced last week, international sanctions would be lifted in phases if Iran meets its commitments. The International Atomic Energy Agency would conduct inspections to monitor significant limits on Iranian nuclear facilities, and the restrictions would be in place for at least a decade."

"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Trump administration acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when it sought to end an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 that the Trump administration violated federal statute when it tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without adequately explaining why. The ruling overturns a lower court ruling a judge in Maryland made last year, which Trump had previously..."
"The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will begin to slow its massive bond purchases later this month, the first step in removing its extraordinary pandemic-era support for the economy.
The long-awaited move signals both optimism about the pace of job growth and wariness about price surges that have pushed inflation up to its highest level in decades. The central bank has been buying $120 billion a month in U.S. government debt and mortgage-backed securities, a process designed to supercharge its efforts to keep borrowing costs low for households and businesses."
"President Biden plans to nominate veteran diplomat Bridget Brink to serve as the United States ambassador to Ukraine, the White House announced Monday.
Her nomination requires Senate approval, and if confirmed, Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, would take over as the top American diplomat in Ukraine as the nation continues to defend itself from Russia's invasion. A career foreign service officer, Brink has had assignments in Uzbekistan, Georgia, Cyprus and Serbia, and served as the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. She also worked for..."
"Chicago Public Schools could resume in-person classes this week after Chicago Teachers Union leaders agreed to a new set of COVID-19 protocols. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Monday that teachers would return to campuses on Tuesday with in-person instruction restarting Wednesday.
The agreement still needs to be approved by the full union, but the Chicago Teachers Union House of Delegates voted to suspend the online learning plan they launched last week as rank-and-file membership votes. The tentative agreement comes after four days of canceled classes.

"Top Senate Democrats are finally in array on a $3.5 trillion price tag for their party's momentous social spending plans. Their next task will be even tougher: selling it to the rest of their party.
The massive top-line number that Senate Budget Committee Democrats released Tuesday night affords plenty of room to spend on President Joe Biden’s priorities, from child care to fighting climate change. But just because Senate Budget Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) climbed down from his initial hopes of a $6 trillion spending plan doesn't mean that his..."

"A Manhattan jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty of rape and sexual abuse but acquitted him of the most serious charges, capping one of the most closely watched trials of the #MeToo era. The mixed verdict means the former Hollywood producer will likely spend time in prison.
It also is some measure of vindication for the six women who testified that Weinstein attacked and sought to intimidate them. Although he was acquitted of the most serious charges — two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape,..."
"When a New York jury Monday found Harvey Weinstein guilty of two out of five charges in his rape trial, his stunned accusers started sending rapid-fire group texts.
""Holy s---,"" one text read. ""I'm shaking,"" read another, according to Louise Godbold, who used to work in commercial production and has alleged that Weinstein attacked her twice in 1991.
It was a day many of Weinstein's dozens of accusers never thought would come: ""That this case got to trial at all, considering the massive clout that Harvey had and the years..."
"WASHINGTON — President Biden’s trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure plan suffered a significant setback late Thursday night when House Democratic leaders, short of support amid a liberal revolt, put off a planned vote on a crucial plank of their domestic agenda.
Democratic leaders and supporters of the bill insisted the postponement was only a temporary setback. The infrastructure vote was rescheduled for Friday, giving them more time to reach agreement on an expansive climate change and social safety net bill that would bring liberals along.
But such a deal appeared far off,..."
"As the United States plunges into the worst economic downturn in decades, there is growing concern that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are being too timid and halting in their approach as they scramble to rescue the economy.

"The Senate Banking Committee took its first look at spending under the massive CARES Act, which Congress approved in March to provide assistance to individuals, businesses and local governments affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were pressed by senators about their stewardship of specific aspects of the approximately $2 trillion relief package at Tuesday's remote hearing.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., criticized both the Treasury secretary and the Fed for not including stronger requirements that businesses borrowing from the central bank keep..."
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have lent hardly any money under a $500 billion fund created by the economic rescue law passed in response to the coronavirus crisis, a congressional oversight panel says in a new report.
The Treasury fund is being used to guarantee new, expansive Federal Reserve lending programs to companies, states and cities that could be leveraged to reach as much as $4.5 trillion.
So far only one of the new Fed programs has started operating, a lending fund likely to be tapped..."
"In Donald Trump's latest budget, aid for lower-income students and programs that offer relief to workers in public service are on the chopping block.
The $4.89 trillion plan, presented to Congress on Monday, would cut the Education Department's budget by $5.6 billion, eking out savings by ending some grants, freezing the maximum amount of others and shifting some payments from the government to borrowers.
A couple of proposals could help those struggling to repay their loans.
The spending plan was criticized by Democrats who control the House and has..."
"THE TRUMP administration would eliminate federal funding for public charter schools under its budget request for 2020, instead allowing states to tap into a $19 billion pool of money to spend on K-12 education as they see fit.
The proposal – from an administration that has made school choice its No. 1 education priority – stands in stark contrast to the last three budget proposals, all of which included major funding increases for the $440 million federal charter school program.
Once a priority, now the federal charter school program is..."

Chauvin, 45, was found guilty of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
The judge asked each juror if the verdict was correct, thanked them for ""heavy duty jury service,"" and dismissed them. He revoked bail and told Chauvin to report back in eight weeks for sentencing. Chauvin was handcuffed and taken into custody.
The former officer, who is white, was seen on video pinning George Floyd, a 46-year-old..."

The attack did not penetrate the security perimeter, the official said."
"In the world many of us would like to see, we’d admire public servants of all kinds for their dedication to the country. Yet we’d also acknowledge that having a government that operates smoothly and free of corruption requires those public servants to accept some conditions on their employment they might not tolerate if they were in the private sector.
Most of the time, that’s how things do work. Members of Congress, for instance, have to file financial disclosures that are made public, which you don’t have to do if..."
"In the months before Labor Day last year, job growth was so slow that economists said it would take until 2021 to replace the jobs that were lost or never created in the recession and its aftermath.
The pace has picked up since then; at the current rate, missing jobs will be recovered by 2018. Still, five years into an economic recovery that has been notable for resurging corporate profits, the number and quality of jobs are still lagging badly, as are wages and salaries.

"President Trump is carefully distancing himself from a new Alabama law that bans abortion in almost all circumstances, even in cases of rape and incest, stressing his “strongly pro-life” credentials while aligning himself with other Republicans who also contend the statute goes too far.
In a late-night Twitter thread Saturday, Trump avoided any direct references to the law in Alabama or in other Republican-led states that have rushed to enact strict new rules against abortion designed to invite court challenges and eventually make their way to the Supreme Court.

"Donald Trump had one more surprise up his sleeve.
The Republican nominee was elected president Tuesday, winning a stunning upset that defied nearly every prediction.

The FDA decision also clears the way for the companies to market their vaccine, which is not permitted without full licensure. And it may launch a race for booster shots, allowing doctors to prescribe extra Pfizer-BioNTech shots ""off label"" to anyone they think should get one.

"It has been nearly two years since Donald Trump made surprising gains with Hispanic voters. But Republican dreams of a major realignment of Latino voters drawn to G.O.P. stances on crime and social issues have failed to materialize, according to a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College.
The poll — one of the largest nonpartisan surveys of Latino voters since the 2020 election — found that Democrats had maintained a grip on the majority of Latino voters, driven in part by women and the belief that..."

"A report released late Friday about the fatal 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, left Republicans in the same position they have been in for two years: with little evidence to support their most damning critiques of how the Obama administration, and then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, responded to the attacks.
Similar to five other government reports, the one released by the House Intelligence Committee on Friday said that the administration had not intentionally misled the public about what occurred during the attacks in talking points it created for officials..."

Ahead of the 96-0 vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told lawmakers, ""Our nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is totally unprecedented in living memory.""
As of the evening of March 25, there were 65,000 diagnosed cases of the highly-contagious virus in the U.S. and more than 900 deaths.
""The legislation..."
"WASHINGTON — In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate on Wednesday passed a $2-trillion economic stimulus package — the largest ever — designed to pump money directly into Americans’ pockets while also shoring up hospitals, businesses and state and local governments struggling against the coronavirus pandemic.
The $2-trillion price tag is equal to more than half of the $3.5 trillion the federal government expects to collect in taxes this year, and is 9% of the nation’s gross domestic product.
“It’s going to take care of people,” President Trump said..."
"To limit voter misinformation ahead of November’s election, Facebook said this week that it would block new political ads from appearing on its site in the week before Election Day.
It was a sweeping action by the social network, which is used by millions of voters. But just how effective could such a move be in minimizing confusion?
The answer: likely not very effective.
That’s because political ads on Facebook are just one piece of content on the social network; political misinformation also flourishes in messages that people post and..."
"WASHINGTON — Greater disclosure of police use of force and no-knock warrants, and financial incentives for local law enforcement departments to ban chokeholds, are the centerpieces of a Senate GOP policing reform bill announced Wednesday.
The Senate bill, and a separate measure being considered in the House, are the congressional responses to the national racial-justice protests that have emerged following the death of George Floyd in the custody of a Minneapolis police officer. The protests, and the video of Floyd pleading with the officer to remove his knee from..."
"British Prime Minister Liz Truss on Monday ditched her signature plan to cut taxes for the country's top earners after it triggered market turmoil and a huge domestic outcry.
Truss, who is less than a month into the job, proposed removing the top tier of income tax — meaning a saving for people who earn more than 150,000 pounds ($168,000) a year — as part of a set of unfunded economic reforms that caused the pound to fall to historic lows and damaged Britain's economic standing globally.
The pound rose after the announcement to around..."
"State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat whose district includes Uvalde, sued the Texas Department of Public Safety on Wednesday, arguing that he is entitled to receive official records related to the Robb Elementary shooting.
The lawsuit, filed in state District Court in Travis County, said it's time to provide answers for Uvalde residents who lost a loved one in the May 24 shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers.
""To date, they have been met with lies, misstatements, and shifts of blame,"" the lawsuit said. ""The State of Texas failed these..."
"Despite a plea earlier in the day from President Biden for House Democrats to support two bills that represent the bulk of his legislative agenda and pass them ""right now,"" House leaders were unable to muster enough votes to pass both measures Friday.
Instead, House leaders say they will vote on the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the Senate in August and on a rule that governs debate for the Build Back Better bill Friday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she'd bring the $1.75 trillion social spending bill to the floor..."
"The third time was not, in fact, the charm.
After a multi-day whipping bonanza, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team dramatically altered course on Friday to satisfy a handful of recalcitrant moderates who refused to back President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion social spending bill.
Instead, Democrats are set to again delay a vote on that party-line measure and turn their sights to just the $550 billion Senate-passed infrastructure bill — bending to the demands of their most vocal centrists in a last-ditch attempt to deliver at least one legislative..."
"Friday may be remembered as the largest global demonstration ever in the fight against climate change. Inspired by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, young people around the world have organized to skip school and protest in the street over the climate crisis and the adults who aren’t doing enough to transition off fossil fuels.
Thunberg and her group Fridays for Future aren’t alone: they’ll be joined by adult climate activists, indigenous groups, workers from companies like Amazon and Google, and really anyone who feels like the world is overdue for..."
"Spurred by what they see as a sluggish, ineffectual response to the existential threat of global warming, student activists from around the world are skipping school Friday, for what organizers call a Global Climate Strike.
The young activists are protesting as the U.N. prepares to hold its Climate Action Summit on Monday in New York City.
The strike's figurehead is 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who traveled from Sweden to New York on an emissions-free sailboat. A little over a year ago, Thunberg began her school strike for the climate..."
"A Harvard University professor was convicted by a federal jury on Tuesday of lying to the US about his involvement with China's government, the Justice Department announced.
Dr. Charles Lieber, 62, the former chair of Harvard's Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, was found guilty of two counts of making false statements to federal authorities, two counts of making and subscribing a false income tax return, and two counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts with the Internal Revenue Service.
Lieber's research group at Harvard had received..."
"Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent an email saying the National Guard would be present to 'protect pro Trump people' in the lead up to the US Capitol insurrection, according to a new report released by the January 6 committee Sunday night.
It was just one of several new details in the report about Meadows' actions before and during January 6, as well as his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. The report is a key component for the committee to send a referral for..."
"The House of Representatives has passed a bill that would stop President Obama from letting millions of unauthorized immigrants apply for protection from deportation.
The bill passed 216-197, with seven Republicans voting against it (and three Democrats voting in favor).
The bill is almost certainly not going to become law. Democrats won't bring it up in the Senate before the end of this Congress, at the end of the month."
"House GOP leaders formally blocked a pair of immigration measures from getting a vote on a critical defense policy bill early Wednesday, dealing another blow to the prospects of legislation to rewrite the immigration system this year.
The Republican-led House Rules Committee, which hews closely to the wishes of leadership, declined to include legislation written by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) — giving a path to green cards for immigrants who came here as children if they serve in the military – among the amendments that will get a vote..."
"President Obama is planning a day of meetings at the White House on Monday to respond to the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and racially tinged anger across the country after a grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager.
Mr. Obama, who has labored to strike the right balance in reacting to the crisis, has not scheduled a trip to Ferguson despite days of speculation about a presidential visit there.
But he will gather his cabinet on Monday to discuss the..."
"Seven of the eight leading Republican presidential candidates gathered in Iowa Thursday night for the seventh debate of the race. Donald Trump, the race's clear frontrunner, was less than ten miles away from the debate site -- holding his own counter-rally after deciding not to participate for decidedly vague reasons."
"Jesse Benton, campaign manager for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is resigning his position, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported Friday. The announcement comes as the McConnell campaign wrestles with Benton's possible ties to a bribery scandal when he was political director for then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) during the 2012 presidential election.
Benton told the Herald-Leader that rumors of his involvement in the scandal ""risk unfairly undermining and becoming a distraction to this re-election campaign,"" referring to McCo"
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign manager has resigned, citing ""inaccurate press accounts"" about his role in past campaigns.
The scandal in question revolves around former Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, who pleaded guilty Wednesday to hiding — and lying about — payments he received in 2012 to switch his endorsement from Rep. Michele Bachmann to then-Rep. Ron Paul.
Jesse Benton, who until Friday worked for McConnell, was Paul's campaign chairman at the time."
"Earlier the World Health Organization set a goal of having at least 10 percent of every country‘s population vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of  this month. It aimed to then raise that figure to 40 percent by the end of the year and to 70 percent by the middle of 2022.
Sadly, these targets have little chance of being met. Of the more than 5.8 billion doses of COVID vaccines that have been administered across the world by mid-September, the vast majority (about 80 percent) have gone to people..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced the immediate ""partial mobilization"" of Russian citizens, a move that threatens to escalate his faltering invasion of Ukraine following a string of defeats that caused recriminations in Moscow.
Putin said in a speech Wednesday that he would use ""all the means at our disposal,"" and threatened the use of nuclear weapons, if he deemed the ""territorial integrity"" of Russia to be jeopardized.
The mobilization means citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription, Putin said, adding..."
"Step one on the all-but-certain path to Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the US Supreme Court — a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee — is officially complete.
Her nomination to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat now heads to a committee vote next Thursday, and a full Senate vote shortly after that. Barring any significant changes in the interim, she’s widely expected to get confirmed, though Democrats are weighing some procedural maneuvers to express their opposition.
Barrett’s testimony this week highlighted her past critiques of decisions..."
"The Israeli air force has destroyed a tower block in Gaza City housing the offices of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera in what has widely been decried as an attack on press freedom.
The airstrikes on Saturday – the sixth consecutive day of hostilities between Israel and Hamas – came roughly an hour after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate al-Jalaa tower.
There was no immediate explanation beforehand for why the 15-storey building was targeted. As well as the two international media organisations, the high-rise was home to..."
"Israel slammed the Gaza Strip with airstrikes on Saturday, in a dramatic escalation that included bombing the home of a senior Hamas leader, killing a family of 10 in a refugee camp — most of them children — and pulverizing a high-rise that housed The Associated Press and other media.
The Hamas militant group continued a stream of rocket volleys into Israel, including a late-night barrage on Tel Aviv. One man was killed when a rocket hit his home in a suburb of the seaside metropolis.

"House Republicans are planning to bombard Joe Biden’s administration with investigations next year, from Hunter Biden to the border to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
As the GOP prepares for a likely takeover of the chamber next year, committee chairs-in-waiting have laid out a lengthy list of oversight goals that goes beyond Biden’s White House — including Democrats’ formation of the Jan. 6 select committee. But the party’s highest-profile targets are those with the potential to politically bruise the president ahead of 2024: his son’s business dealings, Afghanistan, the..."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is within striking distance of President Donald Trump in Texas, tied with him in Georgia and narrowly ahead in Iowa, according to new surveys of the three Republican-leaning battlegrounds.
A New York Times/Siena College poll published Thursday, 40 days from Election Day, shows Trump with a small lead of 3 percentage points in Texas, with 46 percent of likely voters surveyed supporting the Republican incumbent and 43 percent favoring the former vice president.
Trump comfortably won Texas in 2016, seizing the state’s 38 electoral votes..."
"A bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate Tuesday would provide $1 billion to expand education programs and research in civics and history. The bill aims to help to close gaps among students across the nation in civics and history education.
The Civics Secures Democracy Act would establish $150 million for competitive grants for colleges and universities to support civics and history education development and educator preparation. It would also provide $50 million for competitive grants for research that evaluates current civics and history education programs and an additional $15 million for a new fellowship..."
"Net neutrality's old rules are officially a thing of the past. A new set of rules at the Federal Communications Commission went into effect Monday, ending the previous consumer protections that prevented Internet service providers from blocking or slowing legal traffic, or charging for faster delivery of some content."
"Today, June 11, the repeal of net neutrality rules goes into effect. Consumer advocacy groups, lawyers, technology companies, and citizen activists have long decried this move — which was decided in a vote by the Federal Communications Commission in December — as a fatal blow to an open and competitive internet."
"Judge Amy Coney Barrett flatly refused on Tuesday to pledge that she would recuse herself if a dispute over the Nov. 3 election came before the Supreme Court, insisting that despite her nomination by President Trump, she would not “allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.”
During a nearly 12-hour question-and-answer session, Judge Barrett evaded Democratic senators’ attempts to pin down her views on the Affordable Care Act, abortion rights, gay marriage and a possible election-related case. She played down her..."
"C-SPAN has suspended longtime political editor and senior executive producer Steve Scully indefinitely for lying that his Twitter feed was hacked last week.
“I falsely claimed that my Twitter account had been hacked. These were both errors in judgment for which I am totally responsible. I ask for [my colleagues’] forgiveness as I try to move forward in a moment of reflection and disappointment in myself,” he said in a statement. A week ago, Scully tweeted, “@Scaramucci should I respond to Trump” when the president attacked the editor as a..."
"The House on Saturday approved a $25 billion emergency funding bill for the U.S. Postal Service, which Democrats say is urgently needed to halt any attempt by President Donald Trump to impede mail-in voting this fall.
The legislation also would block operational changes deployed by Trump’s postmaster general that have caused widespread mail delays and fueled an uproar across the country. The bill passed 257-150, with 26 Republicans breaking with Trump and GOP leaders to join every Democrat in backing the bill."
"President Trump, who spent the weekend in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, made a theatrical return to the White House on Monday evening, disembarking Marine One and walking the staircase to the South Portico entrance, where he turned to face the cameras, removed his mask and gave his signature two thumbs up.
Shortly before, a masked Trump had emerged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was receiving treatment, pumping his fist and giving a thumbs up as he ignored questions from reporters.
In a video recorded..."
"President Trump returned to the White House from the hospital on Monday, saying that he had recovered from the novel coronavirus and that people should not be afraid of a disease that has killed more than 209,000 Americans.
Trump’s comments a few hours before leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., again downplaying the coronavirus, came despite evidence that White House decisions to flout public health guidelines and engage in practices viewed as reckless have had dire consequences in the West Wing.
More than a dozen White..."
"President Joe Biden announced Tuesday the U.S. has reached an agreement to purchase an additional 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses, a boost that means the U.S. will have enough supply to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of summer or beginning of fall..
""This is a wartime undertaking. It's not hyperbole,"" Biden said during remarks on the COVID-19 pandemic at the White House.
Biden outlined the new purchase plans along with an increase in the weekly vaccine allocation to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to..."
"The Biden administration on Tuesday announced that the federal government intends to purchase 200 million additional doses of two federally approved COVID-19 vaccines, potentially creating a stock large enough to reach nearly the entire U.S. population.
The U.S. has already purchased 400 million shots from manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna, both of which use a novel mRNA vaccine that has proven highly effective in trials but that also requires two doses, spaced weeks apart. With the extra shots that the Biden administration intends to purchase, there would, in theory, be enough..."
"President Donald Trump has, for the first time, publicly suggested delaying November’s presidential election—an unprecedented measure which is beyond the powers of the president.
In his latest tweet pushing his entirely unproven pet theory that mail-in ballots somehow make elections more susceptible to voter fraud, Trump wrote that holding the election during the raging pandemic would be dangerous and mulled whether it would be best to “Delay the Election until people can vote properly, securely and safely.”
Despite his posturing, Trump has absolutely no legal power to follow through on..."
"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Thursday raised the prospect of delaying the November election because of the COVID-19 pandemic, though the president lacks the legal authority to delay elections on his own.
The idea drew bipartisan alarm and election experts noted a president does not have the power to change the date of an election. Others suggested Trump is seeking to sow doubt about the election results or distract from a new government report that found a historic contraction in the nation's economy.
Trump broached the subject..."
"On Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford informed the military that the Pentagon would not implement a ban on transgender troops “until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance.” Until that point, Dunford wrote, there “will be no modifications to the current policy,” and “we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.”"
"As the House investigation into the Jan. 6 attack heats up, some of the planners of the pro-Trump rallies that took place in Washington, D.C., have begun communicating with congressional investigators and sharing new information about what happened when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Two of these people have spoken to Rolling Stone extensively in recent weeks and detailed explosive allegations that multiple members of Congress were intimately involved in planning both Trump’s efforts to overturn his election loss and the Jan. 6 events that turned violent. 
Rolling Stone separately..."
"Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, was expected on Monday to leave his job at the Justice Department, days after private discussions were revealed in which he talked about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office and secretly taping him to expose chaos in the administration."
"Brinksmanship over the debt ceiling could make the fiscal cliff standoff look like child's play.
Right after the House passed the fiscal cliff compromise, President Obama said, ""I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed."""
"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) warned House Republicans not to hold the debt ceiling for political leverage Friday, contradicting Republicans who have strongly hinted at their plans to do just that.
""They’ve got to find, in the House, a totally new strategy,” he said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “Everybody’s now talking about, ‘Oh, here comes the debt ceiling.’ I think that’s, frankly, a dead loser. Because in the end, you know it’s gonna happen. The whole national financial system is going to come in to Washington and on television,..."
"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is using his executive powers Monday to boost the domestic production of solar panels and their parts and will issue a 24-month tariff exemption on imports of the products from several countries.
The White House said Biden will authorize the use of the Defense Production Act to accelerate manufacturing of solar panels in the United States as a way to strengthen the administration's efforts to shift the country toward clean energy.
The move will allow the Department of Energy to ""rapidly expand"" U.S. manufacturing of solar..."
"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) got tangled up in his rhetoric on Sunday as he made the case that any Senate Republican who votes next week to take up a bill to defund Obamacare is actually voting for Obamacare.
During an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Cruz was asked about his plan for when the Senate takes up legislation tying a must-pass measure to keep the government funded past Oct. 1 to another measure to permanently defund the Affordable Care Act."
"Ted Cruz and his allies are fighting a battle they will almost certainly lose in the Senate this week.
The freshman Republican from Texas, along with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and some vocal House conservatives, pushed House Republican leaders to pass a bill Friday that funds the government but denies money for Obamacare. That defunding provision is a nonstarter with President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who says it’s “dead” in his chamber."

"The U.S. unemployment rate has likely risen to 5.5 percent already -- a level not seen since 2015.
A record 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, as restaurants, hotels, barber shops, gyms and more shut down in a nationwide effort to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Last week saw the biggest jump in new jobless claims in history, surpassing the record of 695,000 set in 1982. Many economists say this is the beginning of a massive spike in unemployment that..."
"The US House of Representatives has passed a wide-ranging gun control bill in response to recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas, but the proposals have almost no chance of being approved by the Senate and becoming law.
The bill would raise the age limit for buying a semi-automatic rifle and prohibit the sale of ammunition magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds.
The legislation passed by a mostly party-line vote of 223-204. It has almost no chance of becoming law as the Senate pursues negotiations focused..."
"LAS VEGAS — Bernie Sanders didn’t just win the Nevada caucuses.
He was crushing the rest of the primary field, closing in on another early-state victory and proving an ability to broaden what was once believed to be a narrow coalition.
The victory will likely reverberate far beyond Nevada, with the contest soon turning to Super Tuesday. Sanders is well positioned to compete on that broader electoral map, with an army of small-dollar donors to fund his campaign.
The Latest:
Sanders was crushing other Democrats when multiple TV networks..."
"Elected officials in both parties, but especially Democrats, are failing the American people on health care. This failure to think outside of the box is what’s kept our country from joining the rest of the industrialized world in offering universal health care. We live in a country that sent people to the moon."
"With coronavirus exposure arriving in the West Wing, the White House is taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of the president and his staff after two administration aides tested positive for the coronavirus.
President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will be tested daily for the virus, as will every staff member in close proximity to them. White House guests will be tested, workspaces will undergo regular deep cleaning, and staff will follow social distancing guidelines, undergo daily temperature checks and have their symptom histories reviewed, White House..."
"The brouhaha over President Trump and Vice President Pence appearing at hospitals, factories and nursing homes without masks — despite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that encourage cloth face coverings when with groups of people — has been mostly political. Now, a clearer picture is emerging of the actual health risks of government officials working on the coronavirus response not following federal guidelines themselves.
Case in point: One of the two White House staffers who tested positive for coronavirus, Pence spokesperson Katie Miller, briefed reporters last Thursday..."
"President Donald Trump will declare Thursday that it is “the policy of the United States” to protect people with preexisting conditions, while also suing to toss out current preexisting condition protections.
Trump plans to sign an executive order in North Carolina laying out the policy, according to White House officials. But even they concede it will have no legal effect."
"President Trump on Tuesday fired a top Department of Homeland Security official who led the agency’s efforts to help secure the election and was vocal about tamping down unfounded claims of ballot fraud.
In a tweet, Trump fired Christopher Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at DHS and led successful efforts to help state and local election offices protect their systems and to rebut misinformation.
Earlier Tuesday, Krebs in a tweet refuted allegations that election systems were manipulated, saying that “59 election security experts all agree,..."
"The odds are good that privatizing education will be part of the agenda for President-elect Donald J. Trump’s administration. The Republican platform calls for increasing the role of banks in giving out student loans. And Mr. Trump and the platform advocate an expansion of both vouchers, which enable students to attend the private school of their choice with government funds, and charter schools.
In addition, Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s nominee for education secretary, has supported legislation that would establish vouchers in Michigan, as well as the rapid expansion of the..."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that it approved the availability of the Plan B One-Step emergency contraception pill without a prescription for women 15 and older.
This move comes just weeks after a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, ordered the FDA to make the morning-after birth control pill available to women of any age, without a prescription. Tuesday's FDA announcement, which pertains to an application from Teva Women's Health, Inc., is not related to that, the FDA said."
"The global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is weakening and risks are rising, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The IMF on Tuesday slashed its 2021 growth forecast for the United States by one full percentage point to 6%, the biggest reduction suffered by any G7 economy in its latest World Economic Outlook.
The cut reflects disruptions to supply chains and softening consumption in the third quarter, the IMF said.
The revision comes days after Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecasts for the US economy this year and next, citing weaker consumer spending and the..."
"An expanded no-fly list. New crimes put on the books. Increased use of the death penalty.
These are some of the ways that politicians, pundits and law enforcement want to head off a repeat of the 6 January attack on the Capitol. But a renewed national security push aimed at addressing domestic terrorism has civil liberties groups steeling themselves, concerned that moves to combat far-right extremism will instead redound against communities of color and leftwing activists.
Last summer’s racial justice protests jump-started a national conversation over the endurance of racism..."
"Travel to Europe has been complicated this summer due to a hodgepodge of COVID-19 travel restrictions and entry requirements. Some countries are only allowing vaccinated visitors, others are open to all with a negative COVID-19 test or and/or proof of recovery and still others are throwing quarantines into the mix.
The European Union's decision Monday to remove the United States from its list of safe countries due to a spike in COVID cases, essentially recommending a ban of nonessential travel such as vacations, adds more confusion to the mix for travelers with plane tickets..."
"Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonary specialist who works in critical care, testified Thursday that George Floyd died from a lack of oxygen, bolstering the prosecution's argument that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin caused Floyd's death last May.
Tobin is appearing as an expert witness for the prosecution. He said the state asked him to review documents and videos depicting the circumstances of Floyd's death. Tobin watched some of those videos hundreds of times, he said.
""Have you formed an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty on the..."
"Testimony in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin continued Thursday with a breathing expert saying that George Floyd died due to a “low level of oxygen” that caused brain damage, rebuking the defense’s argument that drugs contributed to Floyd’s death. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist and national breathing expert from Hines, Ill., offered testimony as an unpaid witness that Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck for the “vast majority of the time” and that the pain from the pressure applied by the officer to Floyd was comparable to..."
"Jen Gennai, head of responsible innovation and global affairs at Google, wrote in a Medium post that members of James O’Keefe’s conservative group Project Veritas filmed her without her consent and “selectively edited” her words to make it seem like Google was influencing the 2020 election. Gennai called this nonsense and wrote that “I was explaining how Google’s Trust and Safety team is working to help prevent the types of online foreign interference that happened in 2016.” Gennai quotes Google CEO Sundar Pichai in saying that “we do not bias..."
"John Brennan came well-prepared Thursday and held his own during questioning at his Senate confirmation hearing to become the 21st director of the Central Intelligence Agency. It was in stark contrast to what was considered by many as an ill-prepared, lethargic performance by defense secretary nominee Chuck Hagel at his confirmation hearing last week."
"I have a lot of respect for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But if she does go ahead with a visit to Taiwan this week, against President Biden’s wishes, she will be doing something that is utterly reckless, dangerous and irresponsible.
Nothing good will come of it. Taiwan will not be more secure or more prosperous as a result of this purely symbolic visit, and a lot of bad things could happen. These include a Chinese military response that could result in the U.S. being plunged into indirect conflicts with a..."

"There were only three candidates on the stage in the latest Democratic presidential debate, but each had plenty of big moments as they argued about taxes on the middle class, intervention abroad, and the safety of their campaign data. Here are the most memorable, important, and explosive moments from Saturday's ABC News debate:
1. Sanders apologizes for data breach
Right out of the gate, Sen. Bernie Sanders apologized for this week's data breach, in which Sanders campaign staffers improperly accessed voter data from Hillary Clinton's campaign. And Clinton..."
"Hillary Clinton largely looked past her Democratic rivals in Saturday night’s debate, instead repeatedly assailing the Republican field, led by Donald J. Trump. She called Mr. Trump a threat to the nation’s safety, saying he was fast “becoming ISIS’ best recruiter.”
Deflecting persistent attacks from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland over gun control, Wall Street and foreign military entanglements, she accused Mr. Trump of undermining the fight against terrorism.
Mrs. Clinton"
"Donald Trump traveled to Youngstown, Ohio, to deliver what was billed as a “major” speech on how to deal with the threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist group, a.k.a. ISIS. For reasons known only to Trump, he continued to repeat false statements that have been repeatedly debunked in the past. So here’s a roundup of some of the more notable claims made in the speech."
"Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace was the object of much praise last week over his big, newsmaking interview with President Donald Trump, but said Sunday that Democratic candidate Joe Biden declined the chance for a similar sit-down this week.
“In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent Joe Biden could handle a similar encounter,” said Wallace at the end of his show. “Well this week we asked the Biden campaign for an interview, and they said the former Vice President was not available.”..."
"Over the last few years, Project Veritas has gathered evidence in an effort to prove that CNN slants its coverage to hurt President Trump. In the past, that has meant surreptitiously recording and releasing videos of unsuspecting CNN employees talking about the network’s coverage, as well as releasing leaked tapes of comments made by network executives and staffers in editorial meetings. Last year, the conservative group revealed that a contractor hired by CNN as a satellite uplink technician had been a primary “whistleblower” on the effort.
But on Tuesday, Project..."
"Senate Republicans filibustered one of President Barack Obama's top judicial nominees on Thursday, the clearest sign yet that the Senate may be heading for a messy partisan showdown that could result in Democrats revamping Senate filibuster rules.
The Senate voted 55-38 to advance D.C. Circuit Court nominee Patricia Millett. Democrats needed 60 votes to clear a procedural motion, which meant they needed at least five Republicans to join them. In the end, only two did: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). Three senators voted ""present.""

"The Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott has signed into law one of the most extreme six-week abortion bans in the US, despite strong opposition from the medical and legal communities, who warn the legislation could topple the state’s court system and already fragile reproductive healthcare network.
“This bill ensures that every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the ravages of abortion,” said Abbott, flanked by several members of the Texas legislature this morning.
Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), passed by both chambers of the Republican-dominated Texas..."
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday signed into law a bill that bans abortion the moment a fetal heartbeat has been detected, a move that makes Texas the largest state in the nation to outlaw abortion so early in a pregnancy.
The Texas law effectively prohibits any abortion after around six weeks of pregnancy — before many women are even aware they are pregnant.
The bill, which takes effect in September, makes no exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest but does include a rare provision..."
A Maryland parent was thrown out of a school meeting and arrested after questioning a new state-led education standards initiative. He has been charged with assaulting a police officer and disrupting a school function and could go to jail for 10 years if convicted. Amateur video of the incident has gone viral online over the past few days.
"For months, if not years now, various activists and journalists have been dreaming of an Elizabeth Warren presidential campaign.
Ideological media bias is greatly overstated by partisans, but bias in favor of interesting stories and against dull outcomes is massive and quite real. Barack Obama's 2007-2008 upset of Hillary Clinton was one of the best political stories of my lifetime, while Clinton's utter domination of the 2014-2015 invisible primary is one of the least fascinating. What's more, as Vox's Ez"
"Martin O'Malley launched his presidential campaign Saturday with an appeal to the party's progressive base that he hopes will upend the conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is destined to clinch the Democratic nomination.
The former Maryland governor unveiled his campaign in Baltimore, the city where he was once mayor -- a role that is central to his political persona. But his Baltimore credentials could become more of a challenge than he initially thought after a riot erupted in the city in April."
"The United States has carried out an air raid against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, a US forces spokesman said a day after President Donald Trump spoke to a senior Taliban leader by phone.
""The US conducted an air strike on March 4 against Taliban fighters in Nahr-e Saraj, Helmand, who were actively attacking an ANDSF [Afghan National Defence and Security Forces] checkpoint,"" said Colonel Sonny Leggett in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that it was a ""defensive strike"".
The raid, the first against the Taliban in 11 days, comes days..."
"WASHINGTON — The White House told Congress on Friday that President Trump authorized the strike last month that killed Iran’s most important general to respond to attacks that had already taken place and deter future ones, contradicting the president’s claim that he acted in response to an imminent threat.
In a legally mandated, two-page unclassified memo to lawmakers, the White House asserted that the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was “in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months” by Iran and Iran-backed militias."
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to a two-week delay of former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, allowing the chamber to handle President Joe Biden’s Cabinet nominations in the meantime.
The timeline was sought by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who argued that the ex-president’s legal team should be given sufficient time to prepare for the trial.
The House will send the impeachment article, which charges Trump with inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, on Monday night, and senators will be sworn in on Tuesday.
The House managers..."
"America's inflation problem didn't abate in March. Prices kept creeping up, hitting a fresh 40-year high, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Tuesday.
The Consumer Price Index rose 8.5% for the year ended in March, not adjusted for seasonal swings, outpacing February's elevated reading of 7.9% and matching a level not seen since December 1981. It was slightly higher than the 8.4% economists had predicted.
Most of the March increase was driven by a jump in gasoline and food prices, which rose as the Ukraine conflict threw global commodities markets..."
"Former President Donald Trump's legal team has filed a response to the Justice Department's filing last night, which had revealed new details about the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents.
Trump's lawyers said they wanted the special master to decide questions of executive privilege, not just the limited question of attorney-client privilege. Some legal experts have said that executive privilege exists during a dispute between different branches of government, not the same one, as in this case.
Late Tuesday, prosecutors provided a 36-page court filing, which detailed efforts to hide..."
"The House has once again passed a bill aimed at voter reform and campaign finance overhaul. The Wednesday night vote was 220-210.
Democrats reintroduced the bill in January, after passing it in 2019, banking on the party's narrow majority in the Senate to get it passed through both chambers this cycle.
The bill seeks to ""to expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of big money in politics, strengthen ethics rules for public servants, and implement other anti-corruption measures for the purpose of fortifying our democracy, and..."
"The House late Wednesday night passed expansive legislation to create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting, advancing a centerpiece of the Democratic voting rights agenda amid fierce Republican attacks that threaten to stop it cold in the Senate.
The bill, titled the “For the People Act,” was given the symbolic designation of H.R. 1 by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and it largely mirrors a bill passed two years ago in the early weeks of the House Democratic majority.
This year, however, the bill..."
"President Trump expressed great confidence Friday that he could rally recalcitrant Republicans around legislation strengthening background checks and persuade the nation’s powerful gun lobby to drop its long-standing opposition to such measures, tasks that proved elusive following other mass shootings on his watch.
Appearing outside the White House, Trump claimed meetings in recent days had already yielded strong congressional support for “very meaningful background checks” and that his party, which has stymied gun-control efforts this year by Democrats, would take the lead in passing new legislation after returning from an..."
"After the city of Jacksonville, Florida, announced that masks will be mandatory for public and indoor locations starting Monday, White House press secretary Kaleigh McEnany would not directly say if President Donald Trump planned to wear one at his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.
The event, scheduled for August, is expected to bring more than 40,000 people from all over the country to Jacksonville, and while the rules may apply to them, it's likely Trump will exempt himself.
""I talked to the president before coming out here,"" McEnany..."
"Jacksonville, Florida, is adopting a mandatory mask policy for public gatherings in indoor locations, as well as any other scenario where social distancing isn't feasible. The mandate goes into effect at 5 p.m. on Monday. The news probably won't thrill President Trump, since Jacksonville is the new home to the Republican National Convention.
The convention was initially slated to take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Trump clashed with the state's Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper over social distancing guidelines, prompting other cities to seek the spotlight (formal portions of the..."
"A free trade initiative that is pitting President Barack Obama against his own party cleared a major procedural hurdle in the Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday.
The 62-38 vote to end debate on the bill, moving it toward a final vote, was a victory for Obama, who had linked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to push the bill despite opposition from Senate Democratic leaders.
McConnell said he's willing to consider a host of amendments that Democrats are poised to offer later Thursday.
""This last vote was a major st"
"The Senate advanced President Barack Obama's trade agenda Thursday, voting to end debate on bill that would grant the administration power to fast-track massive new pacts through Congress.
A number of senators objected to the process, complaining that they were unable to get votes on amendments they deemed essential to making sure that looming deals with 12 Pacific Rim nations and Europe live up to promises of helping U.S. workers.
But 62 of their colleagues disagreed and voted to halt debate anyway, setting up passage of the fast-track bill by..."
"Mayor Bill de Blasio called for protesters to suspend demonstrations in the aftermath of the killing of two New York City police officers, who were gunned down on Saturday afternoon in Brooklyn as they sat in their patrol car.
“It’s time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time,” Mr. de Blasio said during a speech Monday afternoon. “That can be for another day.""
The mayor’s call came a few hours after the police..."
"President Joe Biden on Monday warned of potential Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. — making his most prominent alert yet about what he called new intelligence concerning the Putin regime’s plans.
“I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners. It’s part of Russia’s playbook,” Biden said in a statement on Monday. “Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that..."
"The Senate on Thursday easily passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September and sent it to President Barack Obama, a notable departure from chronic, partisan-fueled budget battles in recent years that included the government shutdown last October.
The decisive bipartisan vote, 72-to-26, concluded congressional action that for the first time since 2012 determined federal spending agency by agency instead of through temporary stopgap measures that spotlighted the divisiveness in Washington."
"Congress sent President Barack Obama a $1.1 trillion government-wide spending bill Thursday, easing the harshest effects of last year's automatic budget cuts after tea party critics chastened by October's partial shutdown mounted only a faint protest.
The Senate voted 72-26 for the measure, which cleared the House a little more than 24 hours earlier on a similarly lopsided vote. Obama's signature on the bill was expected in time to prevent any interruption in government funding Saturday at midnight."
"Voters head to the polls Tuesday to choose their party nominees in a high-profile Pennsylvania Senate race that has had some shocking last-minute twists, from the stroke suffered by Democratic front-runner John Fetterman to the late surge by far-right Republican Kathy Barnette.
Fetterman, 52, announced Sunday that he was resting after a stroke and is “well on my way to a full recovery.” He added: “Our campaign isn’t slowing down one bit, and we are still on track to win this primary on Tuesday, and flip this Senate seat in November.”
His rivals, U.S. Rep. Conor..."
"Donald Trump’s tweets at the end of last week were still attempting to push the memo his staff created in collaboration with that of Devin Nunes as if it represented some major reversal of the Russia investigation. But over the weekend, it apparently became clear — even to Trump — that the two reactions to the memo his team spent weeks building up was: “Is that it?” and “What a dud.”"
"The US economy added 224,000 jobs in June, a strong comeback for the labor market after a disappointing May.
The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, the highest level since March 2019 but still historically low.
The number substantially beat the expectations of analysts, who had forecast a drag on jobs because of business uncertainty around high trade tensions as well as a lackluster housing market.
Adding to the positive story, 335,000 people entered the labor force in June — substantially more than usual — which may have been what pushed..."
"Doctors and other staff who care for transgender children at Boston Children’s Hospital are facing a barrage of threats and harassment that started last week with an online campaign, prompting the hospital to seek help from law enforcement and remove doctors’ names and images from its website.
The hospital, which in 2007 established the nation’s first pediatric and adolescent transgender health program, issued a statement late Tuesday saying that it “has been the target of a large volume of hostile internet activity, phone calls, and harassing emails including threats of..."
"After countless dire emails and months of fading bravado, national Democrats in recent days have signaled with their money what they have been loath to acknowledge out loud: They will not win back the House and they will most likely lose additional seats in November.
Since last week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has essentially given up efforts to unseat Republicans in several races, pulling advertising mone"
"As millions of Americans prepare to vote in November — and in many cases, primaries and state and local elections through the summer as well — lots of people are talking about voting by mail. It is a way to protect the integrity of the country's voting system and to limit potential exposure to the coronavirus, which continues to spread widely in the U.S.
I am a political scientist and part of a National Academy of Public Administration working group offering recommendations to ensure voter participation as well as public..."
"Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) insists his Benghazi Committee investigation isn't about hurting 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the polls. It's about providing a definitive account of the 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya.
But if you look at the witness interviews he's attended, and not attended, there is a clear theme: Gowdy is mostly there for the people directly connected to Clinton.
A House Democratic aide familiar with the committee's process tells The Huffington Post that, as of Friday morning, there have been 53 interviews and..."
"House Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings slugged it out on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday as Gowdy sought to justify his panel’s work and Cummings questioned the committee's motives.
Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, again dismissed comments made by three fellow Republicans that suggested the committee is aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton. The former Secretary of State is scheduled to testify before the panel on Thursday, Oct. 22.
“I have told my Republican colleagues and friends: Shut up talking about things you don’t..."
"The House voted Wednesday to form a select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol with nearly all Republicans opposing the legislation — a sign of the political challenges that face Democrats as they attempt to probe why thousands of President Donald Trump’s supporters laid siege to the U.S. Capitol complex.
The 220-to-190 party-line vote stands in contrast to a vote in May, when 35 House Republicans joined Democrats to back creation of an independent commission to examine the attack. But while many House Republicans were willing..."
"Congress is leaving town for a five-week recess after failing to address one of the most serious issues facing the nation: the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Republican leaders in the House were able to recover from an embarrassing setback by passing border legislation late Friday full of political red meat for their conservative base, including revisions to a 2008 anti-trafficking law and more money for the National Guard."
"House and Senate lawmakers scrambled to leave town on Friday night for a five-week recess, with a failure to address the refugee crisis at the southern border only the latest indignity in a year that may redefine congressional dysfunction.
The 113th Congress this week took another step toward ignominy as one of the least productive, most divided in history. Vocal Republicans were empowered, virtually"
"A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration's policy requiring Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided in the U.S., ruling that Department of Homeland Security overstepped its legal authority.
That policy was one of the last attempts by outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to gain control of the southern border, which has seen such an increase in illegal crossings that she resigned from her post over the weekend.
U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco ordered the Trump administration to allow..."
"A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of returning Central American migrants to Mexico while they wait for their asylum cases to be processed in the US.
The ruling issued by Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco states that the preliminary injunction blocking the policy will take effect on Friday at 5 p.m. PT.
""Defendants are hereby enjoined and restrained from continuing to implement or expand the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' as announced in the January 25, 2018 DHS policy memorandum and as explicated in further agency memoranda,"" Seeborg..."
"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday aimed at helping the more than 30 million Americans who suffer from chronic kidney disease.
The changes outlined in the order are intended to help ease the financial hardships for living donors, make it easier for patients to get in-home dialysis, improve the system for collecting usable kidneys from deceased donors, and to give financial incentives for doctors and clinics to help patients stave off end-stage kidney disease by about six months.
Officials cited a study that suggests long..."
"(CNN) On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at transforming kidney care for the more than 37 million Americans with kidney disease. The administration said it is the first kidney-focused executive order since the 1970s.
""Today we are taking groundbreaking action to bring new hope to millions of Americans suffering from kidney disease,"" Trump said. ""So many things don't get done in government, but now we are getting them done."""
"U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his campaign’s compensation package Friday after a Washington Post story highlighted concerns among staffers that they were not receiving the $15-an-hour wages Sanders champions on the campaign trail.
""I'm very proud to be the first presidential candidate to recognize a union and negotiate a union contract,"" the Vermont senator and presidential candidate told the Des Moines Register in an interview Friday. ""And that contract was ratified by the employees of the campaign, and it not only provides pay of at least $15 an hour,..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders is a staple on the front lines of the labor fight, leading the charge in Washington and around the country to raise the minimum wage for workers to $15 an hour. But within his own campaign, which unionized earlier this year, tense discussions over pay have spilled out into public view.
The dispute threatens to undermine Sanders' political message and, if it were to escalate, his ability to credibly advocate for workers around the country currently engaged in their own struggles to negotiate higher wages and..."
"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) called for new leadership to replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), in an interview with The Intercept aired on Wednesday.
The remarks represent Ocasio-Cortez’s most direct challenge to current Democratic congressional leadership, and come a month after Michigan representative Elissa Slotkin vowed not to support Pelosi for another term as House Speaker. Pelosi is the only candidate for the position, but with Democrats projected to win at most 226 House seats, Pelosi can only lose eight..."
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decried the dangers of censorship. He invoked civil rights icons Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass, and hailed the contributions of protesters stretching from World War I to Black Lives Matter. And he delivered a pointed attack on critics who “no longer trust their fellow citizens” to sort out facts from falsehoods online.
The social media mogul’s 37-minute speech Thursday, delivered in a stained-glass hall at Georgetown University, was Facebook’s most assertive effort to date to repel the wave of assaults it’s facing from across..."
"WUSTERMARK, Germany — As environmental protesters were heading into Berlin to rally against the post-Thanksgiving shopping frenzy on Friday, others were heading the opposite direction on a hunt for the cheapest coats, socks or pants.
At an eastern German outlet mall in Wustermark — about half an hour’s drive from the German capital — global protests against the Black Friday tradition and its impact on the environment went largely unnoticed on Friday. Rushing from store to store, shoppers were predominantly concerned about long lines.
“I don’t care about the protests,”..."
"The leader of the violent Islamic State group was killed during an overnight raid carried out by U.S. special forces in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province, President Joe Biden said Thursday.
The raid targeted Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, who took over as head of the militant group on Oct. 31, 2019, just days after leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during a U.S. raid in the same area. A U.S. official said al-Qurayshi died as al-Baghdadi did, by exploding a bomb that killed himself and members of his family, including women and..."
"US Special Forces killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi in a counterterrorism mission in northwest Syria Wednesday evening, President Joe Biden announced Thursday morning.
It was the the biggest US raid in the country since the 2019 operation that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Sources on the ground reported multiple fatalities. At least 13 people were killed in clashes that took place during and after the raid -- including six children and four women -- according to the Syrian civil defense group, the White Helmets. There were no US..."
"In early 2019, a formerly homeless man named Tom Wolf posted a thank-you on Twitter to the cop who had arrested him the previous spring, when he was strung out in a doorway with 103 tiny bundles of heroin and cocaine in a plastic baggie at his feet.
“You saved my life,” wrote Wolf, who had finally gotten clean after that bust and 90 days in jail, ending six months of sleeping on scraps of cardboard on the sidewalk.
Today, he joins a growing chorus of people, including San Francisco’s..."
"Cam Newton finds himself in a no-win situation on matters of race these days, something he mentioned on Wednesday when asked about the shooting death of Charlotte-area resident Keith Lamont Scott by police.
“I’m in a position now where if I say something, it’s going to be critiqued,” the Carolina Panthers quarterback said, “and if I don’t say something, then I’m flawed.”
He’s right — both sides can parse Newton’s words any way they want, and he typically is a lightning rod for criticism no matter what he says. After..."
"Cam Newton ― who previously said that America is “beyond” racism ― has changed his tune in light of Tuesday’s police shooting of a black man in Charlotte.
During the Carolina Panthers weekly media press conference on Wednesday, the reigning NFL MVP was asked to provide his thoughts on the string of racial unrest that has taken place in the city since.
The quarterback at first seemed to hold back sharing his thoughts. Then, he started to open up. Newton repeatedly said that he’s a firm believer in people..."
"On Thursday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz learned that the American military was taking a page from the CIA's playbook and rolling out its own series of ads targeting millennials. 
""Holy crap. Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea,” Cruz writes in a tweet comparing a Russian military ad to a U.S. Army recruiting ad. The Russian ad features recruits shaving their heads and suiting up for a parachute mission, interspersed with shots of a bullet being loaded into a weapon. The American ad, posted earlier this month, is a..."
"The United States transferred five more detainees — all of them Yemenis — from the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on Wednesday, the Defense Department announced. Their release intensified the dispute between the Obama administration and several Republican senators over President Obama’s recent flurry of transfers as he seeks to empty the American-run prison."
"Those of us who have been tracking the novel coronavirus since December can easily identify its key milestones. There was mid-January, when human to human transmission of coronavirus was confirmed. Then later that month Hubei province hit 500 cases, the unprecedented lockdown extended to almost 60 million people, and the Lancet published a study showing that a third of patients require admission to intensive care, and 29% get so bad that they need ventilation. By the end of February, a sobering WHO-China joint mission press conference illustrated the massive policy..."
"NEW DELHI (AP) — India will begin the world’s largest lockdown on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in a TV address, warning citizens to stay inside or risk inviting the pandemic into their homes, and pledging $2 billion to bolster the country’s beleaguered health care system.
“To save India and every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out,” Modi said Tuesday night, acknowledging that the 21-day lockdown would be a major blow to the economy, but that the alternative could set the country back 21 years...."
"At first glance, the July 31 killing of al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri by a US drone attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, appears to be the most significant setback the group has experienced since the death of its founder, Osama bin Laden, in 2011.
However, throughout the decade he administered al-Qaeda, al-Zawahiri worked to ensure the organisation has all the necessary tools in place to survive his death. As such, while the operation that eliminated one of the organisers of the 9/11 attacks is undoubtedly a major win for the current US administration, it is unlikely..."
"Deep inside the White House, in a bare room that the chief of staff uses for meetings, David Simas is still thinking about turnout.
Turnout has been Simas’s job for years now. As director of public-opinion research and polling for President Obama’s reelection campaign, Simas was at the center of the effort to find and persuade young and minority voters to go to the polls like they did in 2008.
Many doubted the Obama campaign’s contention that it could recapture the 2008 electorate. Simas’s data, however, convinced the..."
"With early voting totals smashing records on a daily basis, Democrats are leading with a key constituency — those who did not, or could not, vote in 2016.
So far, more than 20 percent of the early vote nationwide has come from these voters, according to data from the NBC News Decision Desk/TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm.
With 77 million having already cast early votes — a number that the Decision Desk projects could hit 100 million by Tuesday's election — more than 17.5 million of them have come..."
"The ongoing saga of the 2016 Republican primary race took an especially unusual turn Monday: deeply conservative candidate Ted Cruz alleged that iconic right-wing news site Drudge Report is a propaganda machine for Donald Trump. After offering praise for Matt Drudge's famed news aggregator, Cruz told The Mike Slater Show that in ""the past month, the Drudge Report has basically become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign. And so every day they have the latest Trump attack, they’re directed at me."
"There was a time, as she emerged from the rubble of the 2008 campaign, when Sarah Palin was the hottest cultural figure in America.
People loved her. People hated her. She had transcended the narrow bounds of politics to become a larger-than-life figure, the woman portrayed by Tina Fey, the mama grizzly from Alaska. Every journalist in the country knew that if you put Palin's name in an online headline or television segment, your clicks and ratings would soar."
"The news that Sarah Palin will no longer be a paid contributor to Fox News puts an exclamation point on the end of an era, or at least a chapter, in U.S. political history. She could land somewhere else, and she still has her Facebook friends, but its hard to imagine shell find a more visible or influential platform than Fox."
"On the 60th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's famous moonshot speech, President Joe Biden on Monday is set out to lay out his new plan for a new ""American Moonshot,"" an effort aimed at eradicating cancer ""as we know it.""
""This is a, all the way back '62, the moonshot was announced, we're gonna have a moonshot for cancer, for real. We're gonna cure cancer over time. I'm gonna lay out how we're gonna do that,"" Biden said Monday morning as he departed Washington for Boston, Massachusetts."
"A hearing on sexual assault in the military Wednesday was personal for Senator Martha McSally. The freshman Arizona Republican revealed before the Senate Armed Services Committee she had been raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force.
In her first interview since coming forward with the revelation, McSally told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Norah O'Donnell she spoke out to ""give the perspective of why I am advocating so strongly for women in the military."" A portion of the interview will air Thursday on ""CBS This Morning,""..."
"A year after saying she was sexually abused in high school, Sen. Martha McSally revealed during a congressional hearing Wednesday that she was raped by a superior officer while she was in the Air Force.
McSally, an Arizona Republican, said only that an attack happened and implied that it occurred early in her military career that spanned more than two decades.
The personal disclosure came during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel intended to prevent and better respond to sexual assaults in the military in the..."
"US stocks fell sharply in Friday trading as investors continued to worry about even more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve that could land the US economy in a recession.
The Dow (INDU) tumbled 602 points, or 2%, in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq (COMP) Composite were each down 2.2%.
The Dow is currently within 20 points of reaching bear territory. If the Dow finishes at or below 29,439.72, it would mark a 20% fall from the indexes record close of 36,799.65 set on January 4, and send the index into an official bear market...."
"Anthony Fauci has a reputation for plain speaking, as a senator who accused him of lying discovered to his cost on Tuesday.
A congressional hearing on the coronavirus pandemic was electrified when Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, clashed with Rand Paul, a Republican senator for Kentucky and longtime opponent of mask-wearing.
Paul suggested that Fauci had lied before Congress in May when he denied that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded so-called “gain of function” research – the practice of enhancing a virus in a lab to study its..."
"I intended to duly fulfill my duty as a political columnist and write about the first 100 days of Joe Biden’s presidency. My idea was to focus on the 50 Senate Democrats: They don’t have a single vote to spare, they have to broker deals that satisfy both Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin — America does have a multiparty political system, it’s just tucked inside the Senate Democratic caucus — and yet they’ve held together pretty well, on a pretty ambitious agenda.
But as I talked to Senate Democrats about..."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secretly flew to Saudi Arabia on Sunday to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Israeli media said.
A member of Netanyahu’s cabinet and Likud party on Monday confirmed reports that the Israeli leader had held a meeting in Saudi Arabia, calling it an “amazing achievement”."
"As someone with asthma, Meredith Blake was very worried about getting sick in the pandemic. With Covid-19 spreading across America, she stayed inside her home in Boston for 12 weeks, isolating from others as much as possible.
Her self-quarantine ended on June 1. After George Floyd’s killing at the hands of police in Minneapolis, she was compelled to march in the streets with a large crowd of other Bostonians, in close proximity. She wore a face mask and used lots of hand sanitizer wipes.

"It takes a special kind of gall to quit a six-figure media job in the doomed year of 2020. But that’s just what Glenn Greenwald has done, following in the martyred footsteps of erstwhile New York Times freethinker Bari Weiss. In a 4,000-word Substack post, Greenwald resigned from his healthy perch at The Intercept, a publication he co-founded, explaining, in his typically piqued and exhaustive manner, that he had been “censored.”
The censorship—an inflated and, in this case, misapplied term that Greenwald would probably mock if used by someone..."
"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the U.S. doesn't want to take military action against North Korea, but ""all of the options are on the table"" if a serious threat arises.

"Beijing and Washington have agreed to reduce some punitive tariffs on each other’s goods as talks on ending their trade war progress, a Chinese spokesman said Thursday, removing a possible stumbling block to a settlement.
The agreement came during talks aimed at working out details of a “Phase 1” deal announced Oct. 12. Financial markets were rattled by reports China was pushing for tariffs to be lifted, which raised the possibility of a breakdown in talks.
Negotiators agreed to a “phased cancellation” of tariff hikes if talks progress, said a..."

"President Trump retweeted a call to fire his top infectious disease specialist Anthony S. Fauci on Sunday evening, amid mounting criticism of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The call, with the hashtag “FireFauci” came from a former Republican congressional candidate, DeAnna Lorraine, who amassed 1.8 percent of the vote in an open primary challenge to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) this year.
It followed an interview with National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief on CNN’s “State of the Union,” in which Fauci said a stronger early..."
"The Department of Education announced Wednesday that it will cancel $5.8 billion in student loan debt for 560,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct network of for-profit schools known as Corinthian Colleges.
The cancellation amounts to the largest one-time discharge ever made by the Department of Education.
Some of Corinthian's former students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but the new action will ensure that all borrowers who attended from Corinthian's founding in 1995 through its closure in April 2015 will get debt relief.
At its peak in 2010, Corinthian Colleges..."
"BOSTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts plans to drop out of the presidential race on Thursday and will inform her staff of her plans later this morning, according to a person close to her, ending a run defined by an avalanche of policy plans that aimed to pull the Democratic Party to the left and appealed to enough voters to make her briefly a front-runner last fall, but that proved unable to translate excitement from elite progressives into backing from the party’s more working-class and diverse base.
Though her..."
"A gunman killed eight people and wounded several others before apparently taking his own life in a late-night attack at a FedEx facility near the Indianapolis airport, police said, in the latest in a spate of mass shootings after a relative lull during the pandemic.
Five people were hospitalized after the Thursday night shooting, according to police. One of them had critical injuries, police spokesperson Genae Cook said. Another two people were treated and released at the scene. FedEx said people who worked for the company were among the dead...."
"A gunman killed eight people and then apparently turned his weapon on himself at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis on Thursday, in a mass shooting that left several others injured, authorities said.
Here’s what to know:
The authorities were still working to confirm the identities of the shooter and the victims.
As investigators search for a motive, police said the shooting “wasn’t precipitated by any kind of a disturbance or an argument.”
Police responded just after 11 p.m. to reports of shots fired. Upon arriving at the facility, officers came..."
"The U.S. jobs rebound picked up steam last month, fueled by the accelerating pace of vaccinations and a new injection of federal aid.
Employers added 916,000 jobs in March, up from 416,000 in February and the most since August, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 6 percent, down from 6.2 percent in February.
The report came one year after the pandemic ripped a hole in the American labor market. The U.S. economy lost 1.7 million jobs in March 2020 and more than 20 million in April,..."
"In dueling speeches not far from the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump repeated the false election claims that sparked the Jan. 6 insurrection while his former vice president, Mike Pence, implored the Republican Party to stop looking backward.
Potential foes for the 2024 GOP nomination, neither man was ready to announce a campaign, but their speeches underscored divisions in the party between Trump loyalists and Republicans who may still like Trump’s ideas but are more than ready to move on.
The former president was clearly not ready..."
"A federal judge on Monday denied a House request to prevent President Donald Trump from tapping Defense Department money for his proposed border wall with Mexico, saying Congress lacked authority to sue.
Trump's victory is muted by a federal ruling in California last month that blocked construction of key sections of the wall. The California case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition.
U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, wrote that the House's lawsuit was ""about..."
"WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, sparred with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., at a hearing Tuesday after Paul attacked him for appearing to disagree with scientists who said the coronavirus originated in a lab in China.
""What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there, and I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying..."
"President Joe Biden did not take questions from US reporters during his meeting with UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday.
Mr Johnson was speaking about the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring nothing the United Kingdom does interrupts the accords with Northern Irelands. Mr Johnson was responding to questions from two British reporters, CBS’s Steven Portnoy reported from inside the Oval Office.
“On that point, Joe, we are completely at one. And I think nobody want to see anything that interrupts or un-balances the Belfast Good Friday,” Mr Johnson was saying before being cut..."
"Taken together, the reports and warnings painted an early picture of a virus that showed the characteristics of a globe-encircling pandemic that could require governments to take swift actions to contain it. But despite that constant flow of reporting, Trump continued publicly and privately to play down the threat the virus posed to Americans. Lawmakers, too, did not grapple with the virus in earnest until this month, as officials scrambled to keep citizens in their homes and hospitals braced for a surge in patients suffering from covid-19, the disease caused..."
"A relatively small group of House Democrats, including legendary congressman John Lewis, staged a sit-in on the House floor on Wednesday in order to coerce the Republican leadership to hold what will ultimately be a failed vote on new gun control measures. That’s not to understate the importance of what the Democrats attempted, but if they really wanted to out-flank the Republican blockade, they could’ve simply sued the GOP leadership, which is both the favorite tactic of the Republican presidential nominee and precisely what the congressional Republicans have often done..."
"President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to hold up coronavirus relief money for Michigan after he said — erroneously — that the state had sent absentee ballots to millions of voters. It’s not clear that he can do so.
Michigan mailed applications for the absentee ballots, not the ballots themselves.
“Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if..."
"President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding for Michigan and Nevada if the states moved forward in expanding vote by mail.
President Trump on Wednesday incorrectly accused Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state of mailing ballots to all of the state’s registered voters, falsely claiming that it was illegal, as he escalated his assault against mail voting.
The president also threatened to withhold federal funds to Michigan and Nevada if the states proceed in expanding vote-by-mail efforts.
“Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of primaries and the general..."
"If in January 2017, Hillary Clinton is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, historians may well point to this month as the moment her campaign turned around. Like the first brisk snap of fall, Clinton’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad summer has morphed overnight into the best week of her campaign: Joe Biden is out, her poll numbers are up, her crisp debate performance reassured nervous Democrats and her measured resolution before the House Benghazi committee made her interrogators (of both parties) seem small by..."
"For months, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign labored listlessly under a cloud of doubt after revelations that she had a private e-mail server during her time as secretary of state.
Then Republicans, as they have so often do, overreached on their Clinton attacks and, in so doing, handed the Democratic front-runner a message and momentum that she had struggled mightily to build on her own.
First, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) went on Fox News and, floundering to prove his conservative bona fides to be speaker of the House, said this..."
"Earlier today, the Atlantic’s McKay Coppins published a lengthy profile on Mitt Romney, apparently part of Romney’s effort to set himself up as the noble Republican foil to an out-of-control president. These sorts of pieces, which are more about narrative setting than anything else, typically don’t contain a lot of new information, but this had one notable exception. About midway through, the usually guarded senator revealed that, just like fellow lone-voice-of reason-haver James Comey, he was the owner of a secret Twitter account.
At one point, as Coppins asked him..."
"You may know him as Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee with a fastidious approach to blowing out birthday candles, but according to news media reports, the mild-mannered Mormon also has an alter-ego who likes to live (slightly more) dangerously on social media.
Mitt Romney, you see, is also the mysterious Twitter user Pierre Delecto. And Pierre Delecto is Mitt Romney.
""C'est moi,"" Romney confessed in French when confronted about the secret Twitter profile by Atlantic reporter McKay Coppins on Sunday.

"The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell sharply last week to 684,000, the fewest since the pandemic erupted a year ago and a sign that the economy is improving.
Thursday’s report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims fell from 781,000 the week before. It is the first time that weekly applications for jobless aid have fallen below 700,000 since mid-March of last year. Before the pandemic tore through the economy, applications had never topped that level.
Still, a total of 18.9 million people are continuing to collect..."
"Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell to the lowest in a year, signaling improvement for the labor market as more Americans get Covid-19 vaccinations and business restrictions ease in many states.
Initial claims in regular state programs fell by 97,000 to 684,000 in the week ended March 20, Labor Department data showed Thursday. On an unadjusted basis, the claims decreased by 100,412 to 656,789 last week, led by sharp drops in Illinois and Ohio. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey had called for 730,000 initial claims.
The initial claims..."
"As we mark Labor Day, the same dismal long-term job-patterns persist. The economy is nominally in a recovery, but far too many jobs are insecure and fail to offer a middle class standard of living. Whether the Federal Reserve makes things worse by raising rates, or continues its policy of low interest rates, nothing on the near horizon offers hope of significant change."
"PROGRESO, Texas — Two days after giving the federal government his signature, Richard Drawe paused with his wife and mother on a levee that his family has owned for nearly a century to watch the cranes and roseate spoonbills.
A border wall that he reluctantly agreed to put on his land will soon divide this Texan family from the whole scene: the levee, a lake, an onion field and all of those birds."
"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf visited a construction site in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas on a windswept day last month and repeated a Trump administration pledge.
""We are on track to build 450 to 500 miles of new wall by the end of 2020,"" he told reporters. Behind him, steel panels atop a concrete levee wall, 30 feet in all, are rising from the sugar cane fields and bird sanctuaries of the valley — which is really a river delta. They are the first section of new..."
"The White House announced a sweeping immigration bill Thursday that would create an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of immigrants already in the country and provide a faster track for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.
The legislation faces an uphill climb in a narrowly divided Congress, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has just a five-vote margin and Senate Democrats do not have the 60 Democratic votes needed to pass the measure with just their party's support.
Administration officials argued Wednesday evening that the legislation was an..."
"Lawmakers on Capitol Hill will introduce President Joe Biden's immigration plan in Congress on Thursday, including a proposal for a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million migrants living without legal status in the United States.
The plan will include all the elements of the comprehensive immigration legislation proposal that Biden introduced on his first day in office, Biden administration officials said.
The legislation, entitled the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, includes an eight-year pathway to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants, a shorter process to legal status for..."
"President Trump had lost the first presidential debate. Democrats wanted the final weeks of the campaign to focus on the Republican nominee’s weaknesses. Mike Pence’s task was defending Trump, making a Democratic victory sound like a nightmare and disputing the Democrats’ central premise: that a Trump presidency would weaken and divide the country.
“If Donald Trump had said all of the things that you’ve said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn’t have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she..."
"The New York Times website went down for the second time in two weeks on Tuesday, after what the newspaper suspects was an attack by hackers.
On Tuesday afternoon, the site stopped working for a large swath of visitors. They received an ""Internal Server Error"" message instead. The Syrian Electronic Army, a hacker group that supports Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, has claimed responsibility for the attack. At one point, the New York Times homepage re-directed to a page that read ""Hacked By Syrian Electronic Army"" and showed the SEA's logo."
"As an outage of the New York Times website stretched into its second day Wednesday for many users, evidence continued to mount that it was the result of an attack by the Syrian Electronic Army.
The group, loyal to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, has been behind multiple attacks on media websites in recent months and, on Twitter, took credit for a sophisticated hack that had hobbled the news site for roughly 20 hours.

"Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has participated in a keg stand. She has run this desperate ad. She lost an energy committee chairmanship that she often touted, when the GOP took the Senate on Nov. 4. She has clashed -- in front of reporters -- with a leader of her party. That same party basically abandoned her in her runoff campaign for a fourth term."
"In a back-and-forth during Senate confirmation hearings today, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) pressed Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, about her views on abortion. Barrett insisted that she’s entering the confirmation process with “no agenda” but to serve her country and the law.
With the passing of the liberal standard-bearer Justice Ginsburg, Barrett’s nomination has heightened fears that the right to an abortion could be jeopardized. There are special concern concerning the landmark decisions of Roe v. Wade..."
"With the Supreme Court poised to overturn abortion protections, people took to the streets in cities across the country to protest for the right to safe, accessible abortion care for all.
Within hours of Politico’s reporting on a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion on Monday, people flooded the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., protesting against the court’s apparent plan to overturn the landmark abortion protections of Roe v. Wade.
By late Tuesday, hundreds more had gathered outside the nation’s highest court.

Cox, who worked for Christie when he chaired the RGA during the 2014 election cycle, will serve..."
"WASHINGTON — The House voted on Thursday to force President Trump to go to Congress for authorization before taking further military action against Iran, in a sharp rebuke of his decision to ratchet up hostilities with Tehran without the explicit approval of the legislative branch.
The vote was 224 to 194, almost entirely along party lines, to curtail Mr. Trump’s war-making power. It followed a bitterly partisan debate in which Democrats insisted that the president must involve Congress in any escalation against Iran, and Republicans — following Mr. Trump’s lead..."
"The House of Representatives approved a resolution that would force President Trump to seek consent from Congress before taking new military action against Iran.
The move comes nearly a week after President Trump green-lighted a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and led to further escalation in tensions with Tehran.
The non-binding war powers resolution was approved in a mostly party line vote of 224-194. Only 3 Republicans and one independent joined Democrats to pass the measure and 8 Democrats opposed it.
The Senate could consider a..."

"As the coronavirus pandemic forces schools and college campuses to go online, the delivery model of education — largely unchanged for centuries — has suddenly been disrupted.
This may seem like the acceleration of a permanent shift toward online learning, but I have my doubts. In fact, economics tells us that technology will make in-person education more valuable than ever.
At the moment, teachers from kindergarten through graduate school are struggling to take their classes online, and the initial results are, understandably, spotty. But the longer this mass experiment continues,..."
"Joe Biden powered to a dominating sweep of the South and surprisingly strong showings in New England and the Upper Midwest on Tuesday night, as he sought to seize control of the Democratic presidential race and overtake Sen. Bernie Sanders as the delegate leader.
Sanders was holding on to a lead in California, the state with the biggest delegate haul of the Super Tuesday primaries, as votes were slowly counted there. But Biden’s victories in Texas and eight other states threatened to at minimum erase the lopsided delegate advantage Sanders..."
"Momentum and timing matter in politics — and both helped former Vice President Joe Biden mount a comeback from almost-left-for-dead to being the alternative to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who went into Super Tuesday with front-runner status after significant wins in early states.
The Democratic presidential race at one point had almost two dozen candidates, but now it's essentially a contest between two men representing dueling ideological poles of the party.
Sanders has energized the progressive wing with promises to transform the party and dramatically expand the government's role.

He says that's not just his view, but the view of some of his closest military and civilian advisers.

"The number of people forced out of work during the coronavirus lockdown continues to soar to historic highs. Another 4.4 million people claimed unemployment benefits last week around the country, the Labor Department said.
That brings the total of jobless claims in just five weeks to more than 26 million people. That's more than all the jobs added created in the past 10 years since the Great Recession.
Still the pace of job losses is slowing. About 5.2 million filed during the week that ended April 11 and last week..."
"More than 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the Labor Department, a signal that the tidal wave of job losses continues to grow during the coronavirus pandemic.
It’s the fifth-straight week that job losses were measured in the millions. From March 15 to April 18, 26.5 million have likely been laid off or furloughed. Jobless figures on this scale haven’t been seen since the Great Depression. The amount of jobs lost in that brief span effectively erased all the jobs created following the 2008 financial..."

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Roger Stone, a longtime friend and ally of President Donald Trump, was found guilty Friday of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 election bid.

With just three days before their end-of-the-year deadline, Congress and the White House are hurtling toward the so-called ""fiscal cliff.""

"This is an unusually promising Labor Day for American unions — maybe the most hopeful for many decades — for several reasons. 
First, the annual Gallup poll released last week showed a 71 percent public approval rate for unions – the highest level since 1965. The sky-high approval rate is even more remarkable given the organizational weakness of organized labor. Unions currently represent just 10.3 percent of the American workforce.
Second, there’s a mini-organizing wave — driven by worker-organizers, not full-time union officials — taking place across the low-wage service sector. Most notably, workers at 235 Starbucks stores..."
"General Motors workers across the country walked out of plants at midnight Monday as the largest U.S. auto strike in more than a decade got underway.
The United Auto Workers called for the work stoppage after the union failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement covering some 46,000 workers at dozens of facilities. GM and the union remained far apart in negotiations on Sunday, when UAW leaders converged on Detroit and decided overwhelmingly to strike after their contract expired over the weekend."

"A government report concludes that federal police did not clear protesters from Lafayette Park near the White House last summer so then-President Donald Trump could walk to a nearby church for a photo op.
The report, released Wednesday by Interior Department Inspector General Mark Lee Greenblatt, says U.S. Park Police and the U.S. Secret Service determined it was necessary to remove protesters from the area in and around the park last June 1, so contractors could install security fencing.
Federal police didn't learn of Trump's plans to walk through the park and examine..."
"When the U.S. Park Police led law enforcement officers into a crowd of mostly peaceful protesters outside Lafayette Square on June 1, 2020, including officers equipped with chemical irritants and officers on horseback, they did so as part of a plan made days earlier to build a fence around the park to protect officers, not to facilitate the visit minutes later by President Donald Trump to a nearby church, an inspector general’s report released Wednesday concluded.
The report also found that D.C. police officers fired tear gas at protesters as..."
"A reckoning about Indigenous peoples’ histories has been unfolding across the United States in the past few years. Many states and municipalities have begun to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead of or in addition to Columbus Day. Some companies, universities and governments are also issuing statements to acknowledge that the land we take for granted was once the homelands of Indigenous peoples. And now most Americans know that the story of a harmonious first Thanksgiving is a dangerous myth. The truth of what Indigenous people suffered, and endured, is finally..."

"The president ratcheted up a fight with a judicial system he sees as biased against him.
President Trump lashed out at two liberal Supreme Court justices on Tuesday, escalating his battle with the judicial system to new heights despite entreaties by his attorney general to refrain from Twitter blasts that complicate the administration’s legal fights.

"President Trump criticized remarks by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg as ""inappropriate"" and said the Supreme Court justices should recuse themselves from cases involving the president.
""I just don't know how they cannot recuse themselves for anything Trump or Trump related,"" Trump said Tuesday in a wide-ranging news conference in New Delhi.
""What Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was highly inappropriate,"" Trump added. ""She's trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way.""

"The massive Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which brought more than 460,000 people to a tiny city of 7,000 residents in South Dakota in August, was a “superspreader” event that was responsible for more than 260,000 new cases of COVID-19 across the nation.
That’s the provocative conclusion from a new study from the Center for Health Economics & Policy Studies at San Diego State University, which also estimated that these cases cost the nation around $12.2 billion.
These numbers have been rejected by city and state officials, who noted that the study..."
"In September 2020, social media was abuzz over a report from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics that linked 266,796 COVID-19 coronavirus cases (a figure that was reported as “more than 250,000” in various headlines) to the Sturgis motorcycle rally held in Sturgis, South Dakota:
IZA Institute of Labor Economics truly did publish a paper estimating that the rally was linked to a surge of approximately 250,000 COVID-19 cases (representing a cost of $12.2 billion). However, while the rally likely contributed to a rise in coronavirus cases, the figures stated..."

"It's long been obvious that Republican senators have little interest in serving as impartial jurors in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. While there is a raft of motivations for such historic perfidy — with several GOP senators politically benefiting from some of the same corrupting influences — one under-examined, non-Russian reason is personal greed.
A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. According to a Center for Public Integrity analysis, several Republican..."

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday morning that a deal had been reached, paving the way..."
"The slow pace of counting mail ballots in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin was a key source of election disinformation in 2020. The delays provided President Trump and his allies with a pretext to claim that the election was being stolen from them as mail ballots, which overwhelmingly went for Biden, were counted and added to vote totals. “We were winning everything, and all of a sudden it was just called off,” Trump complained. “This is a fraud on the American public.”

Kennedy had Bobby, Joe Biden’s sister, Valerie, once ran his campaigns and Ivanka Trump has been one of the 45th president’s most visible advisers.
Kamala D. Harris has her younger sister, Maya Harris. The two are not only extremely close; during Kamala’s year-long presidential run, Maya served as her campaign chairwoman."
"Donald Trump's two-week-old campaign has been pretty good at sticking to two core points: defending the candidate's anti-immigrant remarks at his announcement and pretending that the companies that responded to those comments by ending their business relationships with him were, instead, rejected by him first.

"America's jobs recovery gathered some steam last month as US employers added 531,000 positions in October.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.6%, the lowest level since the economic recovery started in May 2020.
The number of jobs added in October easily outpaced economists' prediction of 450,000 jobs. It marked the first month since July that the official number didn't undercut the consensus estimate.
The US economy gained jobs across the board last month, with leisure and hospitality, manufacturing and transportation and warehousing leading the job gains. The leisure and hospitality sector was..."
"Colorado's former Gov. John Hickenlooper on Monday joined the growing field of Democratic candidates hoping to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020.
The centrist Democrat made the announcement in an online video titled ""Standing Tall."" The video touts Hickenlooper's accomplishments as governor and highlights his biography as an unemployed geologist who became a successful restaurateur.

"The Democrat, who served two terms as governor and two terms as Denver mayor, vowed in a campaign video to “repair the damage done to our country.”
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is adding his name to the list of presidential hopefuls.
The Democrat and self-described “extreme moderate” announced his 2020 run for the White House on Monday morning in a YouTube video that highlights his accomplishments as a Colorado businessman-turned-politician while also directly attacking President Donald Trump.
“I’ve stood up to my fair share of bullies,” Hickenlooper says in..."
The Washington Post is now reporting that the CIA has concluded something widely suspected but never flatly stated by the intelligence community: that Russia moved deliberately to help elect Donald Trump as president of the United States — not just to undermine the U.S. political process more generally.
"President Obama has ordered the intelligence community to conduct a ""full review"" of ""malicious cyber activity"" timed to U.S. elections, the White House said Friday.
The review will go all the way back to the 2008 campaign when China was found to have hacked both the Obama and McCain campaigns, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said at a Friday press briefing."
"A jury on Tuesday convicted two men of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, a swift victory for prosecutors in a plot that was broken up by the FBI and described as a rallying cry for a U.S. civil war by anti-government extremists.
Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were also found guilty of conspiring to obtain a weapon of mass destruction, namely a bomb to blow up a bridge and stymie police if the kidnapping could be pulled off at Whitmer’s vacation home.

"Anxiety is rising among House Republicans about a strategy of appeasement toward fiscal hard-liners that could require them to embrace not only the sequester but also sharp new cuts to federal health and retirement programs.
Letting the sequester hit was just the first step in a pact forged in January between conservative leaders and Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to keep the government open and the nation out of default. Now comes step 2: adopting a budget plan that would wipe out deficits entirely by 2023."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, on Friday defended his decision back home in Kentucky to join Democrats in a vote to clear a filibuster hurdle that allowed a vote to raise the debt ceiling.

"A person in California has the nation’s first confirmed case of the new omicron coronavirus variant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday.
The unidentified individual was a traveler who returned from South Africa to the U.S. on Nov. 22. The case was confirmed by the California and San Francisco departments of public health, according to the CDC.
“The individual, who was fully vaccinated and had mild symptoms that are improving, is self-quarantining and has been since testing positive. All close contacts have been contacted and have tested negative,” the..."
"The U.S. recorded its first confirmed case of the omicron variant Wednesday — in a vaccinated traveler who returned to California after a trip to South Africa — as scientists around the world race to establish whether the new, mutant version of the coronavirus is more dangerous than previous ones.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top infectious-disease expert, announced the finding at the White House.
“We knew it was just a matter of time before the first case of omicron would be detected in the United States,” he said...."
"Just a day after it was revealed that Elon Musk had bought $3 billion of Twitter Inc.’s stock, making him its single largest shareholder, the company’s chief executive officer took to Twitter to announce how the world’s richest man had decided to exercise his leverage.
“I’m excited to share that we’re appointing @elonmusk to our board!” tweeted CEO Parag Agrawal on Tuesday. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board.”
Wait a minute. What’s this “conversations with Elon in recent weeks”..."
"In a major expansion of gun rights, the Supreme Court said Thursday that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense, a ruling likely to lead to more people legally armed in cities and elsewhere. The ruling came with recent mass shootings fresh in the nation’s mind and gun-control legislation being debated in Congress and beyond.
About a quarter of the U.S. population lives in states expected to be affected by the ruling, which struck down a New York gun law. The high court’s first major gun decision in..."
"An advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given a thumbs up to the nation's second COVID-19 vaccine.
The independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted 20-0 with one abstention to support mRNA-1273, a vaccine made in collaboration with the U.S. government by Moderna, a decade-old Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company."
"The nation’s second coronavirus vaccine, produced by Moderna, could be on its way to thousands of sites nationwide by this weekend — a major accomplishment for a company that has never before brought a product to market.
An independent Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Thursday endorsed the shot for adults 18 and over, and the agency is expected to issue an emergency use authorization on Friday."
"With more than 240,000 Americans dead from the COVID virus and far more hospitalized, our country is desperate for a vaccine that prevents serious cases. Billions of dollars in taxpayer money are being spent to put a stop to the virus, yet drug companies are using predominantly mild cases that produce cold-like symptoms, not infections or serious cases, to test the efficacy of their vaccines. Based on the reviews of trial protocols for seven leading vaccine candidates, including those from Moderna and Pfizer, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) wrote last..."
"To the Israeli government, the preliminary deal with Iran that the Obama administration is trying to seal this week is a giveaway to a government that has spent two decades building a vast nuclear program. It enshrines the status quo — at a time when the Iranians are within reach of the technical capability to build a bomb — and rewards some unproven leaders with cash and sanctions relief."
"Three American presidents stood somberly side by side Saturday at the National September 11 Memorial in New York, sharing a moment of silence to mark the anniversary of the nation’s worst terrorist attack with a display of unity.
Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered at the site where the World Trade Center towers fell two decades ago. Each man wore a blue ribbon and held his hands over his heart as a procession marched a flag through the memorial before hundreds of people, some carrying photos of loved ones..."
"President Joe Biden paid tribute to the victims of the Sep. 11 terror attacks Friday, commemorating their lives and the losses of their families in a somber six-and-a-half-minute video.
Biden, in prerecorded remarks to the nation on the eve of the 20th anniversary, hailed the shared sense of national purpose that Americans felt after 9/11, and called unity the ""greatest strength"" of the country.
""Unity is what makes us who we are, America at its best. To me that's the central lesson of Sept. 11,"" he said. ""Unity doesn't mean..."
"Republicans are once again debating whether to stand up to President Donald Trump on trade, setting up another potentially explosive fight between the president and his party.
Trump last week threatened to impose a 5% tariff on Mexican goods on June 10 if Mexico doesn’t do more to stop the growing flow of migrants crossing its northern border into the U.S. The tariffs would rise gradually every month until they reached 25%, where they would stay until Mexico acted, Trump said. His remarks prompted alarm among officials on both sides..."
"At odds early and often, Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan squabbled over the economy, taxes, Medicare and more Thursday night in a contentious, interruption-filled debate. ""That is a bunch of malarkey,"" the vice president retorted after a particularly tough Ryan attack on the administration's foreign policy."
"The two men in open-collar shirts sat facing each other, papers and a BlackBerry strewn on a coffee table, sober looks on both their faces. One leaned forward, gesturing with his left hand, clearly doing the talking. The other sat back in his chair, two fingers pressed to his temple as he listened intently.

"A federal appeals court ruled on Monday in favor of a polarizing Trump administration policy that bans federally funded family planning centers from referring women for abortions.
The 7-4 decision by the California-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit delighted social conservatives who are central to President Trump’s political base. It infuriated civil libertarians, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights groups and more than 20 states that had filed lawsuits to try to block the rule.
The 82-page opinion dismissed the concerns of three lower courts on the..."
"The right-wing media machine has a new villain: Disney.
Right now Fox News, conservative talk radio, and a constellation of right-wing websites and influencers are all training their firepower on the entertainment giant. Disney CEO Bob Chapek's belated stand against Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" bill has given way to right-wing media portraying the company as a ""woke"" organization seeking to ""groom"" children with what they characterize as a radical LGBTQ agenda.
Yes -- really -- Disney. The family-friendly, fun-for-everyone, intentionally inoffensive brand is being challenged like never before, largely by..."
"The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the keeper of the expert consensus on global warming, issuing a painstaking, authoritative report on the state of the science roughly every five years. The body released its sixth assessment on Monday. As with those before it, the latest appraisal was both alarming and unsurprising. Humans are warming the planet. This warming threatens civilization. The worst effects are avoidable, but the problem gets harder to address the longer world leaders wait.
This essential picture has not changed in decades. Yet scientists’ confidence has. Experts are..."
"Not long after a child became the sixth person to die in connection with the catastrophic attack on a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, prosecutors painted a picture of the sole suspect as driven by a twisted thirst for blood.
According to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday, 39-year-old Darrell Brooks, who was arrested in the hours after the parade turned into a bloodbath, ignored demands to stop his car that night. He also seemed to weave around vehicles in an attempt to inflict the most damage possible, prosecutors said...."
"The man accused of driving his SUV through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, was charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide.
Six people were killed and at least 62 were injured in the Sunday rampage as of Tuesday, per a criminal complaint.
Suspect Darrell E. Brooks, 39, appeared for a preliminary hearing at the Waukesha County Courthouse on Tuesday in connection with the incident.
Prosecutors say an additional charge will be filed after an 8-year-old child died from injuries sustained in the tragedy, bringing the death toll to six.

"Most years, when our calendrical odometers turn over from a string of nines to zeroes, we take stock of the year behind us with some mix of satisfaction and regret, and set goals, make resolutions, and lay out plans for the year to come. On public questions plainly beyond our control — politics, the economy — we turn to pundits and other professional prognosticators to help us out, to better prepare for and take advantage of what the future will likely bring.

"Gas prices are finally coming down from their record highs, but will it last?
The answer so far isn’t too clear.
For the 28th consecutive day, prices at the pump fell Tuesday, July 12, when the national average hit $4.66 per gallon, down 36 cents from June’s record-breaking high of $5.01 per gallon, data from AAA shows.
Oil prices, too, are starting to drop. As of July 12, the price for a barrel of oil dipped below $100 for the first time since May 10, according to The Wall Street..."
"GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's new promise to restore the Medicare cuts made by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law could backfire if he's elected.
The reason: Obama's cuts also extended the life of Medicare's giant trust fund. By repealing them, Romney would move the program's insolvency eight years closer, toward the end of what would be his first term in office.
Instead of running out of money in 2024, Medicare's trust fund for inpatient care would go broke in 2016 without the cuts, according to estimates by the..."
"Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, are accusing President Obama of hurting seniors by slashing $716 billion out of Medicare.
Obama, meanwhile, is attacking Ryan for wanting to ""end Medicare as we know it.""
These heated exchanges come as both sides look for ways to wring savings out of Medicare before the entitlement program runs out of money. They just differ on who will pick up the tab.
Obama, through his health reform law, cuts the rates of providers, including hospitals and insurers. Ryan, on..."
"An investigation into a fatal gun battle at a Jersey City kosher market Tuesday afternoon has made it “clear” that it was targeted attack, according to Mayor Steven Fulop. The mayor wrote on Twitter late Tuesday that the shootout that left a police officer, three passersby, and the two suspects dead was deliberately started at a Jewish grocery in the Greenville neighborhood of Jersey City. “Based on our initial investigation (which is ongoing) we now believe the active shooters targeted the location they attacked,” Fulop wrote. He added on Wednesday..."
"The shootings that left at least three civilians and one police officer dead Tuesday in Jersey City, N.J., was a targeted attack, according to local authorities. At a news conference Wednesday, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop explained that the pair of shooters, who were also killed, had clearly singled out the kosher market on which they opened fire.
""At the time of the incident yesterday, it was difficult to understand intent, and there's still a lot of questions around that. But after reviewing the [closed-circuit TV] cameras on the Jersey..."
"The stark differences between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden were on display during their competing town halls on Thursday night, and in no space was that clearer than the magnitude and frequency of their falsehoods.
The fact that the second debate was cancelled after Trump backed out of the proposed virtual format deprived Americans of a chance to see the two candidates sparring on the same stage. But where Biden scattered in a small number of exaggerations or misstatements over about an hour and a half, Trump..."
"Philando Castile’s killer, police officer Jeromino Yanez, was acquitted of manslaughter and two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm on Friday. The case of Castile’s shooting last July in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota had sparked mass protests after his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds posted a dramatic and wrenching video of the shooting’s aftermath. The video, taken with Reynolds’ 4-year-old daughter in the car, included footage of Castile lying in a puddle of blood after he was struck five times from seven shots."

"President Barack Obama's ambitious proposal to give millions of Americans more affordable access to a community college education and what he called a ""ticket to the middle class"" is unlikely to become law any time soon.
His plan is to partner with states and fund the first two years of community college for Americans ""willing to work for it."" The White House will work to push this plan through Congress"
"Some 9 million Americans could attend community college tuition-free under a proposal President Barack Obama announced Friday.
His plan, which is subject to approval by Congress and depends on the participation of state governments, would dedicate some $60 billion over the next decade to defray tuition and fees for anyone who attends school at least half-time, maintains a roughly C+ average, and is on track to complete their program or transfer to a four-year school. The federal government would kick in about 75 percent of the cost, while participating states..."

"I am hard-pressed to think of one thing President Trump has done right in the last 11 days since his inauguration. Until Tuesday, when he nominated an extraordinary judge and man, Neil Gorsuch, to be a justice on the Supreme Court.
The nomination comes at a fraught moment. The new administration’s executive actions on immigration have led to chaos everywhere from the nation’s airports to the Department of Justice. They have raised justified concern about whether the new administration will follow the law. More than ever, public confidence in our..."
"DONALD TRUMP’S ANNOUNCEMENT of 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for Supreme Court was greeted with lavish praise from Republicans who commended his constitutional literalism.
The mainstream press, meanwhile, fixated on comparing him to the man he would succeed, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, rather than digging into his record.
Gorsuch was said to be the least controversial pick on Trump’s shortlist, having sailed through his early confirmation hearings in 2006 with only a few questions on assisted suicide from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. But now Gorsuch has..."

Trump eventually responded to Wallace's question by referring to a white supremacist group, saying, ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand..."
"The question Chris Wallace posed to President Donald Trump was direct.
“Are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say they need to stand down?”
The president shrugged his left shoulder. “Sure, I’m willing to do that. But I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.” Trump continued to say words, and to say nothing. “I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.”
Wallace pressed the question. “Well, then, do it, sir.” Former Vice..."

"Saying Hamas must pay a “very heavy price” for belligerence, Israeli bombs destroyed a 13-story apartment building in Gaza that had a Hamas presence. And saying Israel “ignited fire” and is “responsible for the consequences,” Hamas launched more rockets at Israel.
We’re now seeing the worst fighting in seven years between Israelis and Palestinians, and again a basic pattern asserts itself: When missiles are flying, hard-liners on each side are ascendant. Civilians die, but extremists on one side empower those on the other."
"President Trump called the European Union a “foe” of the United States in an interview which aired Sunday, just one day before his controversial — and still unexplained — meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Finland.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a more than $3 trillion coronavirus aid package, a sweeping effort with $1 trillion for states and cities, “hazard pay” for essential workers and a new round of cash payments to individuals.
The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “urgency.” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to consider options.

"The Justice Department moved on Thursday to unseal portions of the search warrant executed at the Mar-a-Lago estate of former President Donald Trump earlier this week.
“The public’s clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred under these circumstances weighs heavily in favor of unsealing,” prosecutors revealed in a court filing connected to the search warrant.
Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the news moments after the department filed the motion in federal court in Florida.
“I personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant in the latter,” he said. Addressing criticisms..."
"MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says his country’s “maquila” assembly plants are offering to give 40,000 jobs to Central American migrants.

And Mexico has also stepped up raids on trains, buses and motels, to stop the migrants from moving north.
Lopez Obrador said Friday “we prefer to keep them (migrants) in the south” of Mexico” because..."

The administration anticipates that another $10..."
"As many Americans came to realize in recent months, QAnon is a crackpot conspiracy theory that says Donald Trump is secretly at war with nefarious forces of evil, including Democrats, Hollywood celebrities, the ""deep state,"" cannibals, and an underground ring of Satanic pedophiles. As we've discussed, this isn't just the usual conspiratorial nonsense bubbling up from the right; it's vastly weirder, more radical, and more dangerous.
Last year, the FBI went so far as to classify QAnon as a domestic-terror threat in an internal memo. As recently as July, the..."
