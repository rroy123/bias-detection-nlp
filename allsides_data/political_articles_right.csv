"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday warned members of Congress that the United States’ cash reserves will likely be exhausted unless lawmakers vote to raise or suspend the debt ceiling by Oct. 18, warning that it’s not clear if the United States would be able to meet all of its financial obligations if no deal is passed by then.
If that deadline is reached, “we expect Treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly,” Yellen warned, adding that it is “uncertain whether we could continue to meet..."

"Inflation accelerated to an explosive 9.1% for the 12 months ending in June, according to the consumer price index, the highest level in four decades.
The much-anticipated numbers reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday revealed that inflation is still soaring, despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, and is near the worst it has been since the Great Inflation that helped bring President Ronald Reagan to office.
The soaring inflation has eaten into President Joe Biden’s approval ratings as the midterm elections approach. Consumer prices have been rising fast since last August, especially for..."

"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell took sides in the two major battles in the House Republican conference this week that could influence the direction of the post-Trump Republican Party: pro-Liz Cheney, anti-Marjorie Taylor Greene.
In a rare scathing statement, McConnell said that Greene's embrace of conspiracy theories is a “cancer for the Republican Party.”
The statement from the Kentucky Republican, which did not mention the Georgia freshman congresswoman by name, comes as Greene is facing calls to be stripped of committee assignments or removed from Congress altogether in light of..."
"President Obama tapped UN Ambassador Susan Rice Tuesday to serve as our nation's next national security adviser.
Tuesday morning my reaction was why appoint Susan Rice as national security adviser? She will be a DISASTER.

"A draft Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo that warned of Russian efforts to question the health of President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden was never disseminated because it was of poor quality and lacked context, DHS officials said Wednesday.
The July 7 memo, originally drafted by DHS’ Office of Intelligence and Analysis and obtained by Fox News, found that “Russian malign influence actors are likely to continue denigrating presidential candidates through allegations of poor mental or physical health to influence the outcome of the 2020 elections.”"

"Top congressional Republicans and Democrats say they've reached a deal to allow President Obama to negotiate trade deals subject to an up-or-down vote from Congress.
The ""fast-track"" legislation comes as Obama seeks a sweeping trade deal with 11 Pacific nations. It would renew presidential authority to present trade deals that Congress can endorse or reject, but not amend.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership proposes a trade agreement involving the United States, Japan, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico and seven other Pacific-rim nations.
The debate scrambles traditional partisan alliances."

"President Barack Obama is one of the most powerful men in the world. He’s commander in chief of one of its mightiest militaries, too.
Yet in spite of all that, Obama feels inadequate from time to time. Especially when he’s vacationing in Hawaii and working out alongside strapping Marines at their gym.

"The departure of Madeleine Westerhout, who was widely regarded as Trump's ""gatekeeper"" and had been stationed at the front of the Oval Office, was reported by the New York Times.
The report said Westerhout was considered a ""separated employee"" and would not be allowed back in the White House after the president found out she ""indiscreetly"" divulged information about the Trump family and Oval Office operations in a recent off-the-record dinner with reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump had a working vacation."
"Isaac has already hit the Associated Press for misrepresenting Florida’s anti-critical race theory bill. TV commentators are running with the AP’s spin, claiming that it outlaws “white discomfort,” a phrase nowhere found in the bill.
The actual bill text is here. It nowhere protects any particular racial or ethnic group, but extends its protections equally. It addresses “discomfort” in two places; I will emphasize the relevant sections in bold. One is in the section on prohibited forms of employment discrimination.
Now, the critics have one small point here: It probably would be better..."
"The White House on Friday said that President Biden is expected to increase the refugee cap for this fiscal year, just hours after he signed an order that kept it at Trump-era levels and sparked fury from congressional Democrats.

"The U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2.0 percent in the third quarter, a figure that is well below forecasts, driven down by a slowdown in consumer spending and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that led to renewed restrictions and delays of reopening of businesses.
Data released on Oct. 28 by the Commerce Department show gross domestic product (GDP) rising by 2.0 percent in the third quarter, after growing 6.7 percent in the second quarter. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected third-quarter GDP to rise by 2.8 percent, with Thursday’s..."
"A group of 10 Republican senators is headed to the White House Monday to discuss a potential compromise on a coronavirus relief plan that could gain bipartisan support to pass the Senate, in the first sign of significant talks between the parties on the issue.

It’s over.
The cable news networks loved it because they love a show but there was no real drama. Americans knew for months how this would turn out. They knew Democrats didn’t have the votes in the Senate. It was all about targeting select Republican senators in the next elections.
The people turned off this farce of Democratic Impeachment Theater long ago."

"CNN host Chris Cuomo ignored the bombshell news Tuesday that his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D., was accused by the state's attorney general of sexually harassing 11 women. 
The stone silence from CNN’s most-watched host, who offered his brother advice and even drafted a statement to respond to the allegations against him in February, has some critics saying he should be taken off the air. Others feel the embattled network missed a chance to display journalism morals and ethics that have eroded in recent years.

"Assume, for the moment, that at the height of “Cuomosexuals” in 2020, members of the national news media did not know that Andrew Cuomo habitually and shamelessly sexual harassed women who worked for him for many years.
There was still that odd incongruence that New York state persistently ranked at or near the highest in COVID-19 deaths per million residents. And it wasn’t merely a factor of New York City getting hit first or the sheer population density. Nineteen months after the first diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., New York still..."

The president also sought to offer more reassurance about the government's efforts. In recent days, his administration has been under intense fire for conflicting messages, a sluggish national response and haphazard testing for the COVID-19 virus, which began in..."
"The silencing of conservative speech on social media has spiraled into a ""coordinated effort"" by big tech to close down Parler, according to the social media platform's CEO John Matze.
""This was a coordinated attack by the tech giants to kill the competition in the marketplace,"" Matze's statement read. ""We were too successful too fast.
""You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don't count us out. #speakfreely.""
Matze's statement comes as Amazon is removing the platform from its webservers, which might take the conservative..."
"Add the Postal Service to the list of problems Congress is so far unable to fix.
America's mail service endured its first-ever default overnight, failing to submit a required $5.5 billion payment for future retirees' health benefits by Thursday.
The unprecedented lapse prompted new questions about the fate of the Postal Service as its financial situation spirals ever out of control, and Capitol Hill lawmakers have started a new round of fingerpointing after deadlocking over how to break the slide.
""Congress must act quickly in order to..."
"House Democrats said Monday they plan to introduce a resolution condemning President Trump’s “xenophobic” comments against four freshman Democratic lawmakers, as more Republicans publicly criticized Mr. Trump for his remarks telling the Democrats to go back to their original countries.
“The House cannot allow the president’s characterization of immigrants to our country to stand,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues in a letter. “Our Republican colleagues must join us in condemning the president’s xenophobic tweets.”
She said a resolution will be introduced by Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, who..."
"Five people have been sentenced to death in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but the two most senior officials implicated in the murder were cleared of wrongdoing because of ""insufficient evidence,"" Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor announced Monday.
The convicted defendants have not been named. Three others were sentenced to jail terms totaling 24 years.
Khashoggi, who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post, was killed after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. He was one of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s most prominent critics.

"A graphically violent parody video, shown at a meeting of President Trump’s supporters at his Miami resort, depicted a likeness of the president shooting and stabbing his opponents and members of the news media in a church, The New York Times reported Sunday.
In the video, Trump’s critics and media members are portrayed as parishioners fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O’Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders’ head on fire and shoots..."

“Yes, I will run for the United States Senate in 2020,” Moore said. “Can I win? Yes, I can win.”
The former chief justice of Alabama’s Supreme Court was accused during his 2017 campaign of touching and making sexual advances toward teenage girls, including a 14-year-old, in the 1980s, when he was in his 30s. The judge, who lost the election..."
"Beware of this scoop from CNN's Dana Bash -- not because she isn't credible as a journalist, but because the sourcing is totally opaque. Why would anyone within Trump's upper echelon leak this detail and intentionally draw blood from their just-announced teammate? And who would be in a position to know this information, but also have an incentive to run off and gossip to CNN that Trump supposedly came thisclose to dropping Pence and heading in another direction? Here's Bash's tweet, which is making the rounds:"
"The U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to 13.3 percent in May, down from a record high in April, indicating the nation's economy is recovering faster than expected from the coronavirus lockdown.
The Labor Department said in its Friday report that employers added a stunning 2.5 million jobs in May -- the biggest increase on record. The economy shed a combined 22.1 million jobs in April and March, meaning there are an estimated 21 million Americans currently out of work.
Economists surveyed by Refinitiv expected the report, conducted in mid-May, to..."
"Tuesday’s big electoral wins have handed the reins of Congress to Republicans for the remainder of President Obama’s term, but immediately raise the question of whether the next two years will bring more acrimonious gridlock – or some compromise on key issues ranging from immigration to energy.
In his victory speech Tuesday night, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is expected to ascend to majority leader, said some things won't change next year. But he stressed that lawmakers and the White House don't have to be in ""perpetual conflict"" and..."
"January 27 has been designated by the United Nations as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The date was chosen because, on January 27, 1945, the infamous Nazi German slave labor and death camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated by the Soviet army.
The camp, actually it was a complex of camps and work sites, was the destination for more than 1.3 million people arrested, deported, and enslaved by Hitler’s regime. Beyond imagination, an estimated 1.1 million were murdered there, of whom one million were Jews from across Europe and one hundred thousand were..."
"A group of protestors smashed a window and stormed Hong Kong's legislature building Monday amid another round of massive demonstrations in the city on the 22nd anniversary of the return to Chinese rule.
The crowd, comprised of mostly young protesters, could be seen on video using a cargo cart and large poles as battering rams against the glass panel.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended every 16- and 17-year-old in the United States get a COVID-19 booster shot, provided their last vaccination was done at least six months ago.
“Although we don’t have all the answers on the Omicron variant, initial data suggests that COVID-19 boosters help broaden and strengthen the protection against Omicron and other variants. We know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and I strongly encourage adolescents ages 16 and 17 to get their booster if they are at least 6..."
"In June 2007, then-Sen. Barack Obama told a mostly black audience of ministers that the country's leaders ""don't care about"" New Orleans residents, suggesting the city was neglected in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina because of institutional racism, according to an unedited video reported on by The Daily Caller"
"In what could be a new warning sign for President Trump’s 2020 re-election bid, a new poll indicates that for the first time since his 2016 election victory, more voters say the economy’s getting worse rather than better.
Thirty-seven percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday said the economy’s getting worse, with 31 percent saying conditions are getting better.
That’s a switch from Quinnipiac’s June poll, when by a 39-23 percent margin, those questioned said the economy was improving."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced overnight that she plans on taking measures to potentially curb President Trump’s ability to conduct military operations against Iran.
Pelosi and other Democrats have been critical of Trump’s decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, claiming he did not properly notify Congress in advance and warning about the risk of escalation in the region. Trump has also threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani’s death.
“This week, the..."
"President Donald Trump's repeated calls for easier monetary policy may not be what's driving the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates on Wednesday.
But Trump's policies have set the table for it.
His aggressive tactics on trade, including 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods that prompted retaliatory duties on U.S. exports, have made companies uncertain about the future and more hesitant to invest.
The Fed's beige book, a collection of economic anecdotes from around the country, now regularly features an escalating and eclectic collection of trade-related impacts.

"Progressive policies are great: Thats the gist of what President Obama will suggest during Tuesdays State of the Union speech, according to various leaks, analyses and outright guesses.
The focus on a “course correction and return to a focus on progressivism, as The Daily Caller describes it, comes amid a long-term economic lag that is being answered by Democrats and the White House with a call for more tax increases. By comparison, Mr. Obama highlighted in his last major speech Ã¢â‚¬â€ Januarys inaugural address Ã¢â‚¬â€ on social policy and..."
"According to a new poll, Carly Fiorina is the Republican presidential candidate of choice after Thursday night’s debates.
The nationwide poll of more than 17,000 people from the Association of Mature American Citizens — a conservative organization for those 50-years-old and up — asked who won Thursday night and included candidates in the official GOP debate and the earlier, second-tier debate.

"With heavy hearts, the Biden family—and their closest friends and loved ones—laid to rest Beau Biden, 46, on Saturday. He was Biden's eldest son, and the first child of an incumbent president (or vice president) to die while in office in roughly five decades. He was also an Iraq War veteran, former Attorney General of Delaware, and a rising star in the Democratic Party, rumored to be running for governor in 2016. He died on May 30th of brain cancer.

"While the U.S. population grew from 2010-2020, it was at a slower rate than in any decade in nearly a century, according to new census data.
Census data unveiled on Monday revealed that the U.S. population on April 1, 2020, was 331.5 million, an increase of only 7.4% from 2010.
The only decade dating back to the 1910s that experienced a slower increase in population growth was the 1930s, during the Great Depression, where it increased by 7.3% from 1930-1940, according to the Washington Post. Slowed population growth is a..."
"In a “fact check” published on Saturday, USA Today claimed to “confirm” rumors that President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign was selling merchandise emblazoned with a “Nazi symbol,” the “Imperial Eagle.” By Sunday night, however, after being fully embarrassed on social media, the paper walked back their claims.
The “fact check” came in response to claims made by two Twitter accounts, Bend the Curve, a left-leaning anti-Semitism watchdog account, and The Lincoln Project, a Republican anti-Trump political action group. The two organizations both noted that Trump’s campaign was selling shirts featuring..."
"USA Today was dragged over the weekend after publishing a “fact check” claiming the Trump campaign sold shirts featuring a Nazi symbol of an eagle, and later clarified that “the eagle is a longtime US symbol, too.”
The paper published a “fact check” claiming “Trump's campaign website recently unveiled a T-shirt that has come under fire because of design similarities between its logo and a Nazi symbol” and coming to the conclusion that the claims are “true.”
“The claims that a Trump campaign T-shirt has come under criticism for using..."
"Defense Secretary James Mattis, the last of a team President Trump dubbed “my generals,” will step down early next year amid deepening rifts with the White House on crucial foreign policy matters, marking the departure of an original Trump Cabinet member and creating a leadership void at the Pentagon at a critical time for the president at home and abroad."
"Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard cast the lone “present” vote Wednesday evening on both articles of impeachment against President Trump and defended breaking from her party, slamming the process as tainted by partisanship.
After reading the impeachment report, the Hawaii congresswoman said in a statement that she “came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no.”
“I could not in good conscience vote against impeachment because I believe President Trump is guilty of wrongdoing,” Gabbard said. “I also could not in good conscience..."

"A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered a lower court to allow the case against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to be dismissed, as requested by the Justice Department -- likely ending the years-long legal saga stemming from the Russia investigation.
The abrupt ending came in a 2-1 ruling and order from judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
This was the result of an appeal from Flynn's lawyers asking for a so-called writ of mandamus -- essentially an order telling a government official..."
"Job openings soared to a record high at the end of April, the labor Labor Department said Tuesday, adding to fears about unfulfilled demand for workers.

"Katie wrote about it this morning. It’s confirmed, folks. The FBI had a spy embedded with the Trump campaign. She added the bureau did not have enough evidence to launch a criminal investigation, so they executed a counterintelligence probe instead in July of 2016. The code name was “crossfire hurricane.” This was the investigation signed off by FBI agent Peter Strzok. Sztrok was a top counterintelligence agent before being transferred to human resources after his extramarital affair with bureau lawyer Lisa Page was made public and the two’s texts, which..."

The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low, while the labor force rate was also little changed at 63.2 percent.

"President Joe Biden vowed to take executive action to enact police reform “in the coming weeks,” after Republicans on Capitol Hill killed a Democratic police reform bill Wednesday.
Biden released a statement Wednesday acknowledging that there is no longer a path forward for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which had already passed through the House. Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Democratic California Rep. Karen Bass introduced the legislation earlier this year, but failed to garner enough Republican support in the Senate.
“The murder of George Floyd is..."
"An independent panel of medical experts overseeing AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine trial accused the pharmaceutical company of cherry-picking favorable data, The New York Times reported.
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) alleged that AstraZeneca misrepresented the results of its coronavirus vaccine trial when it announced Monday morning that the vaccine had 79% efficacy at preventing symptomatic coronavirus, according to the NYT. The panel wrote a sharply-worded letter to the British pharmaceutical company and U.S. health officials hours after the results were released, triggering the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious..."
"The Senate voted to advance President Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure package on Wednesday, only hours after a bipartisan group of lawmakers finalized the deal. 
In a 67-32 vote, the chamber advanced the bill in a crucial test vote. The legislation cleared the 60-vote hurdle with 17 Republicans joining all 50 Senate Democrats.
The pace was quicker than the usually plodding Senate as lawmakers prepared to leave Washington for a month-long summer break.
“I’ve said for weeks that we intend to move two things in July,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said of the infrastructure bill..."
"Britain has a new Prime Minister. Britain's Conservative Party has chosen Boris Johnson.
He's a fan of America and has defended President Trump. He's also vowed to make Brexit happen in three months, but his first challenge will be the escalating naval crisis with Iran.

"Republican leaders in the House and Senate on Wednesday immediately dismissed President Barack Obama’s speech about his effort to resolve the VA healthcare scandal — including the top Senate Republican, who said Obama’s remarks make it clear he cared more about the Obamacare website than the health of veterans.
“When the website for Obamacare wasn’t working, President Obama publicly and repeatedly pledged to get it working,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “I’m disappointed he has not pledged as loudly and as repeatedly to do the right thing for..."
"Officials in California voted to approve a plan on Thursday to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035.
The new rule would mandate that 100 percent of all new cars sold in California by 2035 must be zero-emission, according to the reports. The plan would set a target of 35 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in the state by 2026 being zero-emission. By 2030, that target would increase to 68 percent.

There will a half-dozen support planes along for the trip, Marine One helicopters, and a 25- to 30-vehicle motorcade belching exhaust into the air."
"Lots of recriminations and pearl-clutching on the Left yesterday and today after Bernie Sanders channeled Marco Rubio and called Hillary Clinton unqualified to be president. This, after Clinton tied Sanders' heterodoxies on gun rights to the Sandy Hook massacre of elementary school children. A very tame race is getting a bit heated, as Leah noted earlier. Watch:"
"U.S. negotiators reportedly lowered the bar for their own goals during talks over Iran's nuclear program in response to resistance from the Tehran team. And, on the heels of a framework deal being announced in Switzerland, France's top diplomat on Friday admitted his country had initially held out for firmer terms.
The emerging reports indicate the U.S. team, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, gradually backed down over the course of the talks as Iran's delegation dug in. The Wall Street Journal, citing current and former U.S. representatives..."
"On the menu today, Iowa’s Democrats give America a night it will never forget, for all the wrong reasons, while Republicans have a delightfully boring and predictable caucus night.
The Night the Iowa Caucus Died
For Iowa Democrats, the night of February 3, 2020 will forever rank among the greatest disappointments, frustrations, and purely enraging humiliations of their lives. As of 6:35 a.m. Eastern this morning, the Iowa Democratic Party simply . . . cannot tabulate the votes!
The delay is baffling, as anyone should be able to do this..."
"We live in a time of heedless iconoclasm, and so one of the country’s oldest traditions is under assault.
Thanksgiving is increasingly portrayed as, at best, based on falsehoods and, at worst, a whitewash of genocide against Native Americans.
The New York Times ran a piece the other day titled, “The Thanksgiving Myth Gets a Deeper Look This Year,” bristling with hostility toward the day of gratitude and noting that “the holiday arrives in the midst of a national struggle over racial justice.” (The paper is admirably consistent — a..."
"The fake University of Farmington, set up by the Department of Homeland Security, that resulted in the arrest of 250 foreign students this year and prompted outrage from leftists, was a concept embraced by the Obama administration, which engaged in similar operations.
Leftists experienced a collective freakout this week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the arrest of dozens of foreign nationals committing visa fraud by enrolling in the fake university. It was “part of a sting operation by federal agents who enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India,..."
"President Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with ""Axios on HBO"" that aired Monday night, refused to praise late civil rights icon and Rep. John Lewis, citing Lewis' decision not to attend his inauguration and State of the Union speeches.
Interviewer Jonathan Swan repeatedly challenged Trump on topics ranging from the increasing number of coronavirus cases when he held his indoor and largely maskless rally in Tulsa, Okla., to Afghanistan to mail-in voting. Swan also asked Trump his opinion of Lewis.

"A program implemented by the National Security Agency to help the U.S. and its allies track the computers and networks used by North Korean hackers was critical in gathering information that led Washington to conclude Pyongyang was behind last year's cyberattack on Sony Pictures.
The New York Times reported late Sunday that the NSA began placing malware in North Korean systems in 2010. Originally, the purpose of the surveillance was to gain insight into North Korea's nuclear program, but the focus shifted after a large cyberattack on South Korean banks..."
"Ninety-four percent of Americans who died from COVID-19 had other “types of health conditions and contributing causes” in addition to the virus, according to a new CDC report.
Using provisional data on coronavirus-related deaths from the week ending Feb. 1 through Aug. 22, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded last week that “for 6 percent of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.”
“For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death,” the report said."
"The Orlando massacre is sickening and frightening. It's sickening on its face: Dozens of innocent people were shot to death by a remorseless, merciless fanatic on Saturday night, executed for the 'crime' of carousing with friends at an establishment that caters to a clientele despised by their killer. It's frightening because this horror was not perpetrated by masked men shouting slogans in an unfamiliar tongue thousands of miles away."
"Three states have gone to court to get an amendment added to the Constitution. House Democrats plan a vote in support of this scheme. What the Left is attempting to do here is to subvert Article V of the Constitution — the part that spells out the proper way to amend the Constitution — in order to make it easier for liberal judges to impose their policy preferences on the nation.
The purpose of the Equal Rights Amendment is to put seemingly innocuous language into the Constitution — declaring men..."
"Each time the pro-life movement celebrates a victory, it seems it then has to face another setback. That is no truer than the past year.

"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging Western governments to bar Russians from entering their countries — declaring that they ought to “live in their own world until they change their philosophy.”
The leader of the besieged country made the request in an interview on Monday with the Washington Post as the Pentagon announced another $1 billion aid package to Ukraine.
Zelensky told the newspaper that “the most important sanctions are to close the borders — because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land.”

"High stakes were matched by some of President Trump's harshest campaign rhetoric yet at a rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Monday night, with just hours to go until voters there head to the polls in a pivotal toss-up special election that will decide the winner of a long-contested -- and long-vacant -- House seat.

The consumer price index climbed 7.9% on an annual basis, according to data released on Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Month-over-month, inflation rose 0.8%.
The year-over-year reading is in-line with estimates and compares with an annual 7.5% jump in January, marking the fastest increase since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.6%.
Gas jumped 6.6% in February and accounted for almost a third of price hikes. Food rose by 1%."
"Inflation continued to surge last month — with prices rising more than expected and at the fastest pace in more than 30 years as companies grapple with a snarled supply chain and a nationwide labor shortage, the feds announced Wednesday.
The Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index, which measures a basket of goods and services as well as energy and food costs, jumped 6.2 percent in October from a year earlier.
That’s up from September’s 5.4 percent year-over-year rise in prices and is the biggest 12-month rise since 1990."

"When President Trump suspended the issuance of new H-1B work visas for high-skilled foreigners, he explained it as a way to bolster job prospects for unemployed Americans. But if companies can’t bring talent to the U.S., they respond by shifting resources and research abroad, according to a study released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Britta Glennon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, examined data on 2,263 U.S. multinational companies. When the cap on H-1B visas dropped precipitously in 2004, multinational firms that were more reliant..."
"Slowing private payroll growth in June, an indicator of broader labor market performance, will play a key role in whether the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates later this month.
Non-government employers added 102,000 jobs, according to a Wednesday report from payroll-services provider ADP that economists view as a gauge of overall hiring. While a sharp rebound from gains of 41,000 in May, it's still well below the average of 224,000 for the first four months of 2019.

"In a rebuke to Gretchen Whitmer, the Republican-led Michigan state House of Representatives repealed a 76-year-old law that gave the governor broad emergency powers used to lock down much of the state during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a 60-48 vote mainly along party lines, the Emergency Powers Act of 1945 was officially scuttled. The state Senate had already voted to kill the act last week.
Though the legislation does not take effect immediately it was a clear shot at Whitmer, whose strict shut-down policies stirred protests last year, but also made her..."

" President Biden, in 2017, wrote a college recommendation letter for the son of a Chinese executive who did business with Hunter Biden, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.
The president has repeatedly denied discussing Hunter's business ventures with his son. 
Fox News Digital obtained emails between Hunter Biden and his business associates involved in his firm Rosemont Seneca’s joint venture with Chinese investment firms Bohai Capital and BHR. 
Hunter held a 10% stake in BHR as recently as last year, the White House previously acknowledged. Hunter's attorney told the New York Times in..."
"The US recorded more than 1 million COVID-19 new cases Monday — a daily record for any country since the pandemic began.
The 1,082,549 COVID-19 cases reported by Johns Hopkins University comes as the highly contagious Omicron variant rages across the country.
The startling figure is the largest single-day tally of any nation ever reported and nearly double the previous US record of 590,000 cases set just four days ago, Bloomberg News reported.
The massive caseload is also more than double the highest total reported by any nation during the ongoing pandemic that..."
"On Monday, Parkland survivor and outspoken conservative Kyle Kashuv announced that Harvard University had withdrawn his admission from the school over the revelation of racist, offensive, idiotic posts written on a private Google document with friends when he was sixteen years old. Never mind that Kashuv apologized publicly for the comments; never mind that his public behavior has evinced no racism whatsoever.
Forgiveness must be withheld."
"Earlier today, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Gill v. Whitford — better known as the “Wisconsin gerrymandering case” — and the plaintiffs lost, at least for now. Wisconsin will not have to redraw its legislative districts. But the court didn’t rule for Wisconsin on the merits. Instead, it held that the plaintiffs hadn’t established Article III standing in the case. They hadn’t established a concrete, particularized, individual harm. Instead, they were arguing that they had suffered harms because they were Democrats, and Democrats as a whole were underrepresented..."
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is vowing to continue the truck inspections that have snarled traffic at the Texas-Mexico border until there is action from both President Biden and Mexican officials to stem the ongoing migrant crisis at the southern border.
Abbott spoke Wednesday as he signed a memorandum of understanding with the governor of Nuevo Leon that would see inspections stopped at the bridge in Laredo in return for what he called ""enhanced border security enforcement measures"" at the ports of entry and along the Rio Grande from Nuevo Leon."
"President Biden is expected to announce the American Families Plan during his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday that has been framed as a complement to earlier massive investments during the COVID-19 era, but critics will likely seize on the plan as an attempt to extend major parts of the earlier relief packages.
The legislation is an effort to build on the American Rescue Plan, which was the $1.9 trillion behemoth passed in March. Republicans were opposed to the earlier plan because they argued that only nine percent of..."
"In the interest of providing much-needed aid to Ukraine, avoiding a government shutdown, and sending as much pork home to their home districts as possible, members of Congress acted on a bipartisan basis this month and passed an omnibus spending bill six months into the fiscal year.
As badly as they behaved in doing this, they at least had the good sense to purge from this 2,700-page monstrosity President Joe Biden's request for $22.5 billion (later $15.6 billion) in additional funds for COVID relief."
"The Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, according to a bombshell new report from Politico.
A draft decision from Justice Samuel Alito obtained by the outlet states that “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”"
"President Trump said he disagrees with the ""send her back"" chant that broke out during his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, which was directed at Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar.
Asked why he did not stop the audience in Greenville, Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office, ""I think I did — I started speaking very quickly.”
He added, ""I was not happy with it — I disagree with it."""
"If the Jan. 6 House select committee’s infamous track record is any indication, it would have already leaked new smoking-gun evidence in their possession heading into Thursday’s prime time hearings. But there was no leak because there is no smoking gun.
Instead, last Friday, the illegitimate Jan. 6 committee — choking from a lack of relevancy — was handed a lifeline as the politicized Biden Justice Department indicted former Trump adviser Peter Navarro for allegedly being in contempt of Congress. It was unbelievably fortunate and coincidental timing for a committee desperate to..."
And an awful speech by John Kerry. Secretary of State John Kerry used the word “conscience” over and over again as he attempted to explain and justify the Obama administration’s decision not to veto a one-sided U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. He added that the U.S. could not “stand idly by” while Israel torpedoed any hope for a two-state solution. The Obama administration knows all about standing “idly by” – that was its all-but-explicit policy toward other troubles in the Middle East. Obama came into office with one foreign-policy...
"A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation designed to prevent a repeat of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election.
One of the two bills proposed on Wednesday would update the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to “ensure that electoral votes tallied by Congress accurately reflect each state’s vote” and to replace unclear language clarifying the roles of federal and state officials in certifying presidential elections. The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act would also establish guidelines for a peaceful transfer of power by providing federal resources..."
"The suspect in the Highland Park, Illinois, Fourth of July mass shooting was flagged by police as a ""clear and present danger"" in 2019, authorities said Tuesday.

"The government is days away from shutting down, and the Senate may not have the votes to pass the initial version of its funding bill as top Democrats press ahead on a deal with Sen. Joe Manchin that may fail Tuesday.
Manchin, D-W.Va., agreed to help Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pass Democrats' social tax and spending bill last month. In exchange, Schumer promised Manchin a vote on an energy permitting reform to speed new projects. They are combining that with a government funding bill that must pass by Friday night or else..."
"Texas state representative Jake Ellzey defeated fellow Republican Susan Wright in a runoff election for the state’s sixth congressional district, after former President Trump endorsed Wright.
Ellzey won with just over 53 percent of the vote on Tuesday, with Wright taking 46.7 percent. Just 39,000 voters cast their ballots, or fewer than 8 percent of registered voters in the sixth district.
Wright, a GOP activist, was running to fill the seat of her late husband Ron Wright, who died of COVID-19 earlier this year. In addition to Trump, Wright was endorsed by the Club..."
"Tammy Giuliani, owner of Stella Luna Gelato Café in Ottawa, Canada, was forced to shut down her business after an onslaught of threats was made because of her donation to the Ottawa trucker convoy protesting against coronavirus restrictions.
Giuliani donated $250 to the Freedom Convoy via fundraising platform GiveSendGo. After the site suffered a data breach, Giuliani's contribution was made public, and her restaurant began to receive phone calls threatening vandalism and violence.

"President Donald Trump will be declassifying U.S. intelligence findings that China paid non-state actors in Afghanistan to attack American soldiers, Axios reported.
The findings were briefed to Trump on Dec. 17, two senior administration officials told Axios.
Trump has sought to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and increase maximum pressure campaigns on China before he would leave office next month.
While China has maintained a mostly quiet diplomatic role in Afghanistan affairs, Axios has reported China has invited Taliban officials to Beijing for peace talks, but ""Chinese-made weapons and financing have..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a scorching floor speech on Tuesday, accused Democrats of rooting for a ""national crisis"" for political gain as he appealed to lawmakers to move on from the Russia controversy now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report is complete.
""Case closed,"" McConnell, R-Ky., declared. ""Case closed.""
Coming as Democrats clash with Attorney General Bill Barr over his handling of the report while using the findings to fuel their own investigations, McConnell suggested the political debate has shifted from the real problem of Russian interference in..."
"These were little more than the mendacious ravings of a demagogue. President Joe Biden delivered his “voting rights” speech in Atlanta today, telling a crowd:
The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation. Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadow, justice over injustice? I know where I stand. I will not yield. I will not flinch. I will defend your right to vote and our democracy against all enemies foreign and domestic. And so the question is where will the..."
"A former aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has accused the 63-year-old Democrat of several years of sexual harassment, detailing allegations she first made in December in an essay posted to an online publishing website.
Lindsey Boylan, who worked for New York state’s economic development agency and is now running for New York City’s Manhattan borough president, described on Medium.com incidents of an unsolicited kiss, an invitation to play “strip poker,” and “going out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms, and legs.”

"Senators were on track to approve Loretta Lynch to be the new attorney general, defeating an early filibuster attempt Thursday morning, with a final vote scheduled later in the afternoon on what Democrats said was a major civil rights milestone.
Ms. Lynch, a federal prosecutor in New York, would replace Eric H. Holder Jr. and would be the country’s first black woman to reach the top law enforcement post."
"President Biden fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul on Friday amid an ongoing dispute over his leadership of the independent agency responsible for administering retirement and disability benefits.
Saul was one of the few remaining federal appointees from former President Donald Trump’s administration. The White House said he was fired after refusing a request for his resignation. Deputy Social Security Commissioner David Black was also asked to resign and he complied.
The Washington Post was first to report Saul's dismissal. He questioned the legality of Biden's decision in an interview with the newspaper and said..."
"Glenn Beck said on his radio program Tuesday that “Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States.”
Beck said he received information from a friend of his, who is also friends with the “Hillary people,” about Clinton’s campaign strategy in 2016. Beck said that when he heard it, he said, “Oh my gosh, she’s going to win the presidency.”
Beck said Clinton’s “people” told his friend: “The right is so stupid. They just don’t get it. You guys are going to all be fighting on Benghazi and..."
"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a new pandemic low last week, dipping below 300,000 for the first time since March 2020. 
Figures released Thursday by the Labor Department show that applications for the week ended Oct. 9 fell to 293,000 from a revised 344,750 a week earlier. It marked the best level of jobless claims since March 14, 2020, when there were 256,000 applicants just as COVID-19 began to shut down the nation's economy. 
Continuing claims, or the number of Americans who are consecutively receiving unemployment aid,..."
"The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dropped below one million last week for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, likely as the expiration of a $600 weekly jobless supplement discouraged some from filing claims.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 963,000 for the week ended Aug. 8, compared to 1.191 million in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the lowest level since mid-March when authorities started shutting down non-essential business to slow..."
"President Biden began meeting with family members of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan to discuss his continuing commitment to bringing them back home safely, the White House said Friday.
Griner's wife Cherelle, her agent Lindsay Colas, Whelan's sister Elizabeth and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan were participating in the meetings, which began at 4:51 p.m. ET.
""The primary goal of the meetings today is to be able to update the families and keep them completely apprized of where we are in the process and to..."
"The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected former President Donald Trump’s request to quash subpoenas for White House records relating to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.
Trump attempted to invoke executive privilege to stop the House Select Committee on the January 6th Attack from accessing a trove of documents relating to Trump’s activities on Jan. 6 and those of his top confidants. The Court’s brief decision was unsigned and Justice Clarence Thomas was the only member to note his dissent.
Wednesday’s decision signals a new phase for the committee’s..."
"The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has adopted a new rule ahead of Thursday’s second and final presidential debate and will silence the microphone of the candidate who does not have the floor during the uninterrupted two-minute periods at the start of each segment.
The Commission cited their prior announcement to consider “additional structure” to future debates following the first presidential debate with moderator Chris Wallace. The first debate saw several interruptions from both candidates and Wallace. While Joe Biden (D) set the tone by interrupting first, Wallace later stated..."
"The horrific mass shooting at two New Zealand mosques that left 49 people dead was live-streamed on Facebook and shared across social media, sparking a scramble by tech giants to remove the sick footage.
The gunman reportedly broadcast 17 minutes of the attack.
“Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the live stream commenced and we quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video. We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re..."
"Sen. Lindsey Graham voiced his frustrations with previous Supreme Court confirmation hearings on Tuesday during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the high court.
The South Carolina Republican relitigated controversial moments from the confirmation hearings of judicial nominees, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom Graham said was treated poorly when she was questioned about her Catholic faith by committee member Sen. Dianne Feinstein."
"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said Thursday it will allow Texas’s heartbeat abortion law, which allows private citizens to sue providers who perform abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, to remain in effect while it considers an appeal of a judge’s order blocking the new law.
The court issued a 2–1 order siding with the state of Texas, refusing the Justice Department’s request to reinstate an earlier court ruling that had blocked enforcement of the law. The order was backed by Judges James C...."
"Hillary Clinton will appear tonight at her first official campaign event of this cycle – and perhaps her first since 2008 – and it’s a doozy. Hillary will appear at the home of the most famous bitter ender from her failed 2008 bid, uber-rich Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who was a principle PUMA and notorious Barack Obama trash talker. Other wealthy satellites of Planet Hillary, including Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel"
"The White House and Republican leaders in Congress face long odds in trying to revive trade legislation after a telling defeat engineered by President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats.
Obama's ambitious trade agenda is in serious doubt, as is his quest for a capstone second-term achievement.
Without the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend, Obama has little chance of securing the Pacific Rim pact that his administration has worked toward for years.
Friday's rebuff highlighted the strained relations between Obama and congressional Democrats,..."

"It's tax day in America, and if Democrats had gotten their way in 2017, the vast majority of Americans would be paying higher taxes this year. Every single Congressional Democrat voted against the GOP-passed tax reform law that slashed tax burdens for approximately 80 percent of all households --- including an even higher percentage of middle-income families. The Left has deliberately and repeatedly lied about this reality, with minimal and perfunctory fact-checking from the media. As a result, only a fraction of the country realizes that their overall federal tax..."
"Poland will build a fence along its border with Belarus and deploy more soldiers to the area to stop migrants from entering the country.
More than 900 soldiers will be sent, and an 8-foot-tall barrier will be constructed on the border, Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak announced Monday.
""We are dealing with an attack on Poland ,"" he said during a news conference at the border. ""It is an attempt to trigger a migration crisis.""
The Polish government will also offer humanitarian assistance to migrants stuck at the border for over two weeks.

"Economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics are predicting that annual inflation will remain above 2% over the next three years as a result of rising wages and strong demand for goods and services. 
NABE panelists project that the overall consumer price index will rise 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to September's forecast of 5.1%. CPI inflation is expected to remain elevated by the end of 2022 at 2.8% year-over-year, compared to September's forecast of 2.4%.

"Vladimir Putin is stepping up his war on the World Wide Web. In late May, claiming that it was key to Russia’s counterterrorism efforts, Putin signed a decree dramatically expanding his government’s power to regulate — and limit — access to the Internet for the country’s nearly 150 million inhabitants.
The edict, an update to the Kremlin’s 2014 counterterrorism strategy, gives Russian authorities greater control than ever before over the dissemination of information on the Internet. The ostensible goal of the measure is to curb language that could incite hatred..."
"A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Northern California near Napa Valley Sunday, injuring 89 — 3 critically — and causing extensive damage, including fires sparked by burst gas lines, in the largest tremor to rock the Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta quake in 1989.
Leslie Gordon of the U.S. Geological Survey says the tremor struck just before 3:30 a.m. Sunday local time, about 10 miles northwest of American Canyon, which is about 6 miles southwest of Napa."
"Iranian protests are in their third week. What began in outrage over a woman murdered in police custody has spread across the country. Protests have captured the popular imagination. Videos go viral of women cutting their hair, burning headscarves, or singing. Chants of ""Death to the Dictator"" are undeniable. That Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei must rely on the Lebanese Hezbollah to quell unrest suggests desperation.
Wishful thinking is no strategy, no matter the hunger for change. The price of liberty will be high. In 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini promised Iranians an ""Islamic democracy""..."
"British voters streamed to schools, churches and pubs Thursday for a say in their country's future, voting for lawmakers in an election expected to produce no clear victor and lead to days of frantic haggling for power.
Polls put Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives and Ed Miliband's Labour Party in a dead heat. Neither looks able to win a majority of Parliament's 650 seats.
Many voters are turning elsewhere — chiefly to the separatist Scottish National Party, which will dominate north of the border, and the anti-immigrant U.K"
"President Biden canceled a trip to Chicago planned for Wednesday, and will remain in Washington, D.C., amid stalled negotiations over Democrats’ infrastructure legislation, the White House said on Tuesday.
Biden “will now remain at the White House tomorrow to continue working on advancing” a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and additional $3.5 trillion spending plan, a White House official told pool reporters. Biden was initially set to discuss “the ongoing importance of getting people vaccinated” in Chicago, the official said.
The announcement came amid continued gridlock among Democrats over passing the..."
"The White House is weighing a plan to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower in a bid to boost youth voter support just months before millions of Americans hit the ballot boxes for the fall midterms, according to a new report. 
The debt forgiveness, if enacted, would give Democrats a chicken-in-every-pot-style appeal to voters as they head into an election that could see the party lose one or both congressional majorities."
"Despite rumblings of boycotts ahead of his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with roaring applause and standing room only attendance as he entered the U.S. Senate Chamber.
Before addressing the threat of a nuclear Iran, Netanyahu tried to clear up the misconception his visit was political after the White House condemned his invitation from House Speaker John Boehner, which was extended without President Obama’s consent. He also thanked Congress for their support of Israel’s Iron Dome."

The Russian invaders’ artillery gave them a significant advantage as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his troops continue to fight for “literally every meter” of the strategically important city, according to the BBC.
The Russians destroyed multiple bridges to the city, which will be cut off completely if a final bridge is taken out.
Russian efforts to take the city and nearby Lysychansk are viewed as pivotal..."

"Elizabeth Warren released a long-awaited ""Medicare for all"" funding plan after coming under pressure by Democratic rivals about how to fund such a system without middle-class tax increases.
The plan, released Friday, would raise $20 trillion in taxes on employers, financial firms, giant corporations, and the top 1% of earners, including by cracking down on tax evasion. The estimate from the Warren campaign, that the federal government will need to spend $20 trillion more to get ""Medicare for all,"" is $14 trillion lower than many outside analysts have predicted, but..."

That’s not the case. The Trump White House is on the right side of this; the polling shows it. The fans’ reactions have shown it. The NFL owners..."

"President Obama on Thursday downplayed the prospect of any imminent U.S. airstrikes in Syria as he stressed that military advisers are still reviewing options for confronting Islamic State militants in the region.
At the same time, the president bluntly ruled out U.S. military action for dealing with another international crisis -- mounting evidence of Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine. ""We are not taking military action to solve the Ukrainian problem,"" Obama said.

"There were nearly 190,000 migrant encounters at the southern border in June, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Friday — yet another rise in what were already sky-high border numbers, and bringing the total of encounters in fiscal year (FY) 2021 to more than 1 million.
CBP said that 188,829 migrants were encountered at the southern border, an increase from the 180,034 encountered in May. It is also a sharp rise since when President Biden took office — there were 78,442 encounters in January."

"The Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office, Murfreesboro Police Department, and the Tennessee State Police ensured a peaceful “White Lives Matter” rally held in this growing Nashville suburb on Saturday with an overwhelming presence that kept a white nationalist group and counter protesters completely separated."
"The House Judiciary Committee told a federal appeals court Monday that it still wants former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify as it could potentially lead to the introduction of “additional articles of impeachment” against President Donald Trump over his contacts with Ukraine.
In a brief submitted to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the panel’s counsel Doug Letter argued its subpoena of McGahn, who departed the White House last year, is not moot despite the House’s approval of two impeachment articles — abuse of power and obstruction of..."
"Gov. Jay Nixon is ordering the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson, where nightly scenes of unrest have erupted since a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black 18-year-old.
Nixon announced what he called a systematic withdrawal of Guard officers on Thursday. He says they've effectively protected the city while other agencies worked to restore trust between law enforcement and residents."
"President Trump announced on Wednesday that conditions have been met between Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) for what he called a "" permanent ceasefire"" between the two sides and that the United States is lifting sanctions on Ankara that were implemented following the invasion of northern Syria.
Speaking at the White House, Trump said that while a ""permanent ceasefire"" will be tough to maintain in the volatile region, he hopes that it will last and end the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds.
""I do believe it..."
"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, on an overseas trip to the United Kingdom, said there needs to be a balance in considering parental concerns over vaccinations as the U.S. deals with a recent spread of measles.
Asked if he would urge Americans to vaccinate their children, Mr. Christie said that “we vaccinate ours, and so, you know that’s the best expression I can give you of my opinion.”
“You know it’s much more important what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official,” he said,..."
"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation Thursday, marking the end of his time at the top of UK politics.
After resisting calls to step down for nearly two days, Johnson admitted to the world’s media gathered outside No. 10 Downing Street in London that “it is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader and a new prime minister.”
“The process of that should begin now. the timetable should be announced next week,” added Johnson, who went on to thank British..."
"The Justice Department will conclude that there is a “pattern of police bias and excessive force” at the Ferguson, Missouri, police department, but is unlikely to directly charge former Officer Darren Wilson in the death of teenager Michael Brown, several news outlets reported Tuesday.
The full report is expected to be released this week, possibly as soon as Wednesday. The department has been investigating Ferguson law enforcement agencies following the August death of Brown during an altercation with Mr. Wilson.

"Disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the board of the film studio he co-founded have reached a tentative $25 million settlement with several of the people who accused him of sexual misconduct, according to a report.
Under the terms of the deal, Weinstein would not have to fork over any money himself to the accusers nor would he have to admit any wrongdoing, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing lawyers involved in the negotiations.
In October 2017, Weinstein was accused in civil lawsuits filed by more than 30 women..."
"Vice President Kamala Harris insists the US southern border is “secure” — despite the number of illegal migrant arrests on pace to surpass a staggering 2 million this month for the first time ever.
In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Harris acknowledged the immigration system “still needs to be fixed” before pinning the blame on the Trump administration for the border surge that has happened since President Biden took office.
“The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular, over the last four years before..."
"U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland provided testimony to Congress Wednesday affirming a quid pro quo for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to win a meeting and phone call with President Trump.
But Sondland, a pivotal witness in the House impeachment investigation, maintained he did not have direct evidence those conditions were directly tied to critical security aid.
Sondland, in his prepared remarks to the House Intelligence Committee, said that conditions were set for the Ukrainian president to be granted a phone call and meeting with Trump.

"Texas government officials can continue to investigate parents who transition their children to the opposite sex for possible child abuse, the state’s supreme court ruled Friday.
The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) determined that child sex change surgeries constituted child abuse in August 2021 upon prompting by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and the DFPS began investigations of families for potential child abuse over treatments their transgender children were receiving in February. An appeals court had previously blocked these inquiries throughout the state, but the Texas Supreme Court ruled the lower court had..."
"The Republican National Committee issued a rebuke of Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, taking the remarkable step in part because of their participation in the House select committee formed to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
The censure resolution was adopted by an overwhelming voice vote, along with four other resolutions in the Friday general session of the RNC’s Winter Meeting in Utah, where the committee's 168 members gathered. There was no debate on the resolution ahead of adoption, and there were only a handful of “no” votes. It marks the..."
"The TV ad war for the 2012 presidential contest, its total spending expected to swell to $1.1 billion, is set to start anew now that both party conventions are over and the two-month sprint to the general election is under way. Just over a third of that amount has been spent so far, according to the Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks campaign ad spending."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) revealed Friday morning a set of proposed changes to the House rules for the next Congress, which convenes Sunday at noon, including changes that would enshrine gender-inclusive language and cease the use of so-called non-inclusive words in the text of the House rules.
The proposed changes, which will be voted on shortly after the House enters session, would swap out the words father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, husband, and wife for the words parent, child, sibling, parent’s sibling, and spouse in a..."
"The Democratic majority in the House has proposed sweeping changes to language used in the chamber, eliminating gendered terms including ""mother"" and ""husband.""
The proposed rule package seeks to “honor all gender identities” by striking words including “seaman,” “chairman,” “father,” “mother,” “sister,” “husband,” and “wife” from use and replacing them with gender-neutral terms including “seafarer,” “chair,” “parent,” “child,” and “sibling.”
The resolution, proposed Friday by Rep. James McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, will be voted on after the 117th Congress is sworn in on Sunday.
If passed,..."
"Israel’s prime minister on Monday warned the five countries that have resumed negotiations over the defunct 2015 Iran nuclear deal not to be taken in by Tehran’s “nuclear blackmail.”
“Such a murderous regime should not be rewarded,” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a recorded statement in which he pleaded with world leaders not to allow “hundreds of billions of dollars [to be] poured right into their rotten regime.”
“Iran deserves no rewards, no bargain deals and no sanctions relief in return for their brutality,” Bennett said, according to the Jerusalem Post. “I call upon..."
"Europe's efforts to secure enough power for winter were handed a fresh blow today after Gazprom scrapped its own deadline to resume gas supplies via the Nord Stream pipeline as Vladimir Putin continues to weaponise the flow of energy into the continent.
The Russian energy giant said on Friday that all natural gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 would remain cut off 'indefinitely' after an apparent oil leak within the main turbine at Portovaya compressor station was discovered. 
No timeframe was given for the resumption of gas supplies into Europe, despite the..."
"After a year of barely cracking 1% support in national polls, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ended her presidential campaign. That the Hawaii congresswoman finally conceded that two delegates from American Samoa were not enough to clinch the Democratic nomination was not surprising. That she decided to issue a glowing endorsement of presumptive nominee Joe Biden in the process of her withdrawal absolutely was.
As a matter of pure ideology, Gabbard's endorsement constitutes an enormous practical concession that Biden is the de facto nominee. Whereas Biden is one of the most pro-war..."
"“What we have seen already from Vladimir Putin’s regime in the use of the munitions that they have already been dropping on innocent civilians, in my view, already fully qualifies as a war crime,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday.
A prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said he was investigating possible war crimes, examining missile strikes on residential buildings in Kharkiv and other cities.
President Biden said “it’s clear” that Russian forces are targeting civilians. He stopped short of accusing Putin of war crimes, but there’s certainly a case..."
"A comprehensive report by the Senate Intelligence Committee definitively declared that individuals tied to Al Qaeda groups were involved in the Benghazi attack, challenging recent claims that the terror network was not a factor.
The report was released Monday, nearly one year after then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under congressional questioning over the nature of the attack, shouted at lawmakers: “What difference, at this point, does it make?”"
"Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney leads President Barack Obama by 5 points among likely voters in the latest Gallup Daily Tracking Poll.
That's down a point from Romney's 6-point lead among likely voters on Monday – and is 2 points lower than his 7-point lead on Sunday. The 7-point lead was the largest of the campaign, Business Insider reports.

"Democrats have succeeded in sending the largest-ever bill aimed at countering climate change to President Joe Biden’s desk for signature.
The Inflation Reduction Act bill will pour roughly $370 billion into energy security and climate change programs over the next decade, including efforts aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40% of 2005 levels before the year 2030.
Its passage cements a major legislative victory for Democrats, who have fought to push through climate legislation for more than a decade — and lawmakers from all corners of the party have praised the bill."
"It is a very simple proposition. Our Constitution vests all executive power — not some of it, all of it — in the president of the United States. Executive-branch officials do not have their own power. They are delegated by the president to execute his power. If they object to the president’s policies, their choice is clear: salute and enforce the president’s directives, or honorably resign. There is no third way."
"Following a backlash from GoFundMe’s decision to shut down the “Freedom Convoy” fundraiser, citing unspecified “evidence” that the protest was no longer peaceful, the fundraising website has backtracked when it comes to refunding donors.
When first announcing it was shutting down the Freedom Convoy, GoFundMe told donors they would need to use a “dedicated refund form” to request their money back, otherwise the funds would be sent to a “credible and established” charity verified by GoFundMe. On Saturday morning, however, GoFundMe changed the decision and said the funds would be..."
"As we approach the end of 2020, our nation’s mental health is the worst it has been in decades. That’s not my opinion — it’s the findings of a recent report from Gallup, which has asked Americans about the state of their mental health since 2001.
This year, nearly one-fourth of Americans rated their mental health as ""fair"" or ""poor,"" the most significant decline in our country’s psychological well being on record.
The sad truth is these findings won’t surprise anyone who has lived through 2020. A global pandemic, social..."
"Tens of thousands of people rallied in Vienna on Saturday in protest against restrictions introduced to halt the spread of coronavirus in Austria, including mandatory COVID-19 vaccines and home confinement orders for the unvaccinated.
Around 1,400 police officers were on duty to oversee the protest, which attracted an estimated 44,000 people, and followed a similar demonstration in the Austrian capital last week.
Police said three people were arrested for offences including the use of fireworks and disregarding the requirement to wear masks. Journalists covering the event, which began in Heldenplatz square, were attacked with snow balls..."
"President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats are dismissing concerns over skyrocketing inflation, saying trillions of dollars on social programs and alternative energy projects should be passed regardless of the price tag.
Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) said Monday a ""serious inflation problem"" would not change his party's plan to push forward with a multitrillion-dollar spending package. The Democrat argued that voters would rather fight climate change than address rising consumer prices.
""It is hard to argue that 50 years from now the question will be how did this Congress manage..."
"The media convinced themselves that their foamy-mouthed anger with Donald J. Trump was shared by the American people as a whole. The people responded with a giant nuh-uh. President Trump will not go in the books as a Jimmy Carter or even as a George H.W. Bush: Despite his having presided over perhaps the bleakest American year in my lifetime, his reelection was an attractive proposition for a massive slice of voters. Even assuming the narrow Joe Biden victory that now appears likely, the media should prepare themselves a shame..."
"Beep, beep, beep. It’s the familiar sound of food scanned and placed into bags at your local grocery store. You just went in for a few things and meant to keep it under $100. But you walk away with a new case of sticker shock and fewer bags than $100 used to buy.
Inflation has hit every link of the food chain, such as diesel that fuels tractors in the field, and the trucks that deliver food from farm to the food processor, to the warehouse, and then to the..."
"COVID cases are collapsing in front of our eyes. Daily cases are now one-tenth the number of daily flu cases in the middle of a mild flu season, with a now-identical case fatality rate. That’s because the few Americans testing positive are often young, feel fine, and underwent testing as a screening requirement for playing sports or attending gatherings.
The US positive rate is now at a record low, below 3%. Projections for the coming weeks and months are even more favorable. That’s because roughly 80% to 85% of adults are now immune..."
"The novel coronavirus has infected nearly 100,000 people worldwide — spreading to around 90 countries and even slipping past the walls of the Vatican.
The tiny city-state within Rome confirmed its first case Friday, but wouldn’t say who was infected.
The Vatican has insisted that Pope Francis — who canceled audiences last week over a “slight indisposition” — has only a cold. He has tested negative for the coronavirus.
Vatican officials said they are working with Italian authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Italy as a whole remained the..."
"Things are moving fast in American politics, but see if you can remember back five months to last fall. At the time, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the most likely Democratic nominee.
She had big leads in both Iowa and New Hampshire. She had overtaken establishment designated front-runner, Joe Biden, in the national polling."
"Congressional negotiators on Tuesday announced a tentative budget deal that would avoid a partial government shutdown, but also begin to unravel hard-fought spending cuts.

"Four congressional Democrats sent a letter to the owners of Dominion Voting Systems and cited several problems that “threaten the integrity of our elections,” including “vote switching.”
In a December 2019 letter to Dominion Voting Systems, which has been mired in controversy after a human error involving its machines in Antrim County, Michigan, resulted in incorrect counts, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, and Amy Klobuchar and congressman Mark Pocan warned about reports of machines “switching votes,” “undisclosed vulnerabilities,” and “improbable” results that “threaten the integrity of our elections.”"
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) spoke intimately to millions of viewers in Instagram on Monday night to tell her a very personal story about her experiences during the Capitol Hill riot on Jan. 6, and the lingering trauma she has experienced.
Ocasio-Cortez described the experience of hiding from Capitol Hill rioters in her office's bathroom. ""The yells of these men, or just one man, ""she said, fighting through tears, ""yelling 'Where is she? Where is she?'"" It turns out that the man was a Capitol Hill Police Officer, and he was..."
"The story of Jussie Smollett and the implausible hate crime attack against him is now familiar to nearly everyone.
Smollett, a little-known actor on a long-running Fox television show, claimed to have been walking down the street minding his own business at 2 a.m. in downtown Chicago when he was attacked by two white Trump supporters wearing red ""Make America Great Again"" hats who made reference to his race (he is black), his sexual orientation (he is gay), and the obscure television show on which he appeared. The attackers allegedly..."
"Republicans have indicated that Joe Biden’s prospective nomination of Neera Tanden to the Office of Management and Budget would not pass the Senate with a GOP majority.
Tanden, a former Hillary Clinton aide and current president of left-wing think tank Center for American Progress, has a history of comments criticizing various Republican senators, whose approval she would need to head OMB."
"Children have been out of school long enough. Their return to the classroom is absolutely necessary for their success in learning and moving forward in their educational endeavors come this fall. As a father of two adolescent children, I wholeheartedly applaud and agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation which strongly states ""the coming school year should start with the goal of students physically present in school."" Remote learning should not be considered unless parents make their own decision to choose to home school their children.

"Police in Moscow arrested more than 750 people during a demonstration outside city hall on Saturday, where they were calling for fair elections after the upcoming city council elections on Sept. 8 excluded opposition candidates from being on the ballot, according to a Russian organization that monitors political arrests.
OVD-Info said 779 people were detained. Moscow police earlier said 295 people had been taken in, but did not immediately give a final figure."
"A special Texas House investigative committee probing the Uvalde school massacre found multiple failures occurred leading up to the horror and involved everyone from law enforcement to social-media platforms, a report said Sunday.
Other entities to blame included the school itself, Robb Elementary, and the shooter’s family, CNN said, noting it had an early copy of the probe’s finding.
The panel was also set to officially release surveillance footage of the school’s hallway during the May 24 attack, which left 21 people dead. The Austin American-Statesman published the surveillance footage Tuesday after it was leaked..."
"The political-journalism world has decided that this week will be focused upon the one-year anniversary of the January 6 Capitol Hill riot, led by the New York Times editorial board declaring that, “Jan. 6 is not in the past; it is every day.”
Because I’m going to swim against the current here, go back and read what I wrote on January 7 of last year.
I called for Trump’s immediate impeachment and removal from office for his slow response to the violence against the legislative branch. I declared that “Despite their self-identification as patriots..."

"One of the two openly gay hoteliers who hosted Republican Senator Ted Cruz at a Manhattan event last week, has caved to the Gaystapo with the kind of sniveling, dishonest and humiliating apology demanded by the Gaystapo if you don’t want your life ruined.
“I am shaken to my bones by the emails, texts, postings and phone calls of the past few days. I made a terrible mistake,” wrote Ian Reisner on his Facebook page over the weekend.
Reisner went on to"
"Senate lawmakers are still untangling snags in the structure of their highly anticipated gun reform deal, even as its proponents push to turn their agreement into law by the time Congress leaves for its July 4 recess.
Lawmakers still have significant work to do before the agreement can become law.
And members of Congress from both the Right and the Left found reasons to object to the proposals before they became part of a legislative text.

"The U.S. will welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and others seeking to escape from Russia's invasion, and will impose new sanctions on Russian individuals and companies, the White House said.
According to senior administration officials, the Biden administration is looking into multiple methods for those fleeing Ukraine to enter the U.S., including the refugee admissions program, as well as parole and immigrant and non-immigrant visas.
The officials said that President Biden's cap of 125,000 refugees for Fiscal Year 2022 remains in effect, but that those who enter via processes other than the refugee..."
"Maybe he’s embracing the only job he expects to keep.
Chris Cuomo on Tuesday used his SiriusXM show to speak about his brother’s resignation as governor of New York despite being banned from discussing it on CNN — which is weighing his future as a network host amid calls for his ouster.

"The House voted 230-199 to remove Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) from the Education and Budget committees on Thursday evening.
Democrats pushed for Greene’s removal because of numerous past statements and social media posts in support of conspiracy theories, bigotry, and the execution of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). Greene has expressed skepticism over whether the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred; whether shootings at Sandy Hook elementary school and Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School occurred; and stated that the 2018 midterm elections were part of “an Islamic..."
"An analysis of studies released last month by Johns Hopkins University indicated that lockdowns in the spring of 2020 reduced COVID-19 mortality by only 0.2% in the U.S. and Europe, Fox News reported.
Johns Hopkins University economics professor Steve Hanke, Lund University economics professor Lars Jonung, and Jonas Herby, special adviser at Copenhagen's Center for Political Studies,  analyzed various studies regarding how school shutdowns, business closings and mask mandates affected the COVID-19 death rate.

"The aura of “expert” has lost its luster during Covid, as our supposedly bigger brains have been proved wrong repeatedly.
Two of these have been Ezekiel Emanuel and Anthony Fauci. Both were enthusiastic proponents of societal lockdowns as a means of preventing deaths and the spread of Covid. We now know from a Johns Hopkins blockbuster meta-analysis that “shutting it down,” in Donald Trump’s awkward phrase, did very little to prevent deaths.
It’s a long, arcane, and detailed analysis, and I can’t present every nuance or statistic here. But I think these are..."
"Can right-wing populist sentiment be banished from American life by the brute force of social-media censorship? We’re about to find out. After Wednesday’s mob invasion of the Capitol that disrupted the counting of electoral votes, big tech firms have moved, aggressively and in unison, against Donald Trump and his supporters. The companies say they want to marginalize the violent fringe, but their censorship will grow it instead.

"Democrats hope Pat Ryan’s unexpected win in a special election to fill a vacant House seat in New York’s 19th Congressional District is a sign that the Republican Party’s “red wave” will be reduced to a puddle come November.
Top analysts Wednesday downgraded the Republicans’ outlook in the midterm elections and said Democrats may even hang on to their slim majority after Mr. Ryan’s surprise win over Republican Marcus Molinaro.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which provides analysis of elections and campaigns, took notice of Mr. Ryan’s win and lowered its forecast..."
"Former President Donald Trump celebrated “ALL WINS” from his favorites in primary races on Tuesday evening – a tongue-in-cheek statement that may have included his sarcastic “endorsements” of Democrats.
The former president, who endorsed a handful of candidates in the 2022 midterm season, gushed about the wins on his social platform Truth Social.
“Looks like a fantastic evening of ALL WINS – Great Candidates!!!” Trump wrote Tuesday evening.

An internal ABC investigation found that the employee had improperly accessed the footage of Robach, but did not determine whether the employee leaked the footage directly to Project Veritas, which published the video on Tuesday, or shared the footage with someone else who passed on the footage to the right-wing opposition research group.
ABC passed on the findings of its investigation to CBS..."
"The emergence of Tara Reade's accusation of sexual assault against presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden has prompted the swift and sudden collapse of the #MeToo movement's central tenet—that all women who come forward with such allegations deserve to be believed.
In fact, some who speak for the movement aren't merely retreating on this point: They are pretending that feminists who wielded the #MeToo hashtag never claimed that all women should be believed. This is a transparent attempt to rewrite history and should be treated as such."
"Georgia governor Brian Kemp issued an executive order Wednesday overruling mask mandates put in place by local governments in the state to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, calling such rules “unenforceable.”
Kemp’s order, which extended the state’s COVID-19 restrictions through July 31, prohibits local municipalities from enforcing mandatory mask orders that are more restrictive than his statewide order that only encourages face coverings, effectively voiding orders issued by at least 15 local governments across the state, NPR reported.
His previous order, set to expire on Wednesday, had banned local municipalities..."

"Thursday’s 7-2 Supreme Court decision allowing a Peace Cross war memorial to remain on public land in Bladensburg, Md., near the nation’s capital is a landmark victory for religious freedom. This is good news for America.
Thankfully, the days of activist courts illegitimately weaponizing the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause to attack religious symbols on public land are over.
At last, the Bladensburg World War I Veterans Memorial – what everyone can now safely call the Peace Cross – is safe from the wrecking crew. Importantly, so are other memorials honoring..."
"In a recent impromptu interview with Fox News correspondent Peter Doocey, Georgia Senate candidate Jon Ossoff garnered applause from leftists by turning an inquiry about fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock's serious baggage into a scurrilous attack on Republican Kelly Loeffler. The GOP has been highlighting Warnock's arrest for interfering with a police investigation into alleged child abuse at a camp he ran, as well as video of tearful statements from his ex-wife to police officers who responded to a domestic incident call earlier this year. Rather than addressing the substance of..."
"They opened the online flood-Gates.
When Bill and Melinda Gates announced they were getting divorced Monday, the ever-sympathetic social-media masses were quick to pay their respects — with a tsunami of mocking memes.
The philanthropist couple had tweeted the shocking news in a joint statement on their separate accounts yesterday afternoon.
“After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,” they wrote.
The announcement concluded, “We continue to share a belief in that mission and will..."

"The Oscars just delivered more than a slap on the wrist to Will Smith: The academy’s board of governors has banned this year’s Best Actor winner from attending the awards ceremony for the next decade after he assaulted comedian Chris Rock at the 2022 ceremony.
The academy’s 54-member board convened for a reportedly “contentious” Zoom meeting on Friday morning to discuss “possible sanctions” against the actor — who will, as it turns out, be allowed to keep his trophy."
"Twitter said on Tuesday afternoon that it plans to close a deal with billionaire Elon Musk.
Twitter shares soared 22% in late afternoon trading on the news.
Earlier in the day, Musk revived his proposal to acquire the social media giant for his original offer of $54.20 per share.
The company originally accepted Musk's $44 billion offer in April. However, the billionaire notified Twitter in July that he was planning to terminate the deal after claiming the company breached its obligations by misrepresenting the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform. Twitter..."
"An Iranian oil tanker has been hit by two explosions off the coast of Saudi Arabia.
Tehran said a supertanker called Sabiti, owned by The National Iran Oil Company, was struck by two missiles 60 miles from the port of Jeddah around 5am Friday.

“The RNC has not been supportive. They were always supportive when I was a contributor. I was their fair-haired boy,” the business mogul told The Hill in a 40-minute interview from his Manhattan office at Trump Tower on Wednesday. “The RNC has been, I think, very foolish.”"
"New York City aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels, beginning with a plan to retrofit public and private buildings.
Every municipal building that uses significant amounts of energy, about 3,000 structures, will be improved by 2025, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement today. The city will give private landlords incentives and, later, mandates to ensure their buildings pollute less. About three-quarters of the city’s emissions result from power used for heating, cooling and operations.

"The Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg surrendered to Manhattan prosecutors on Thursday as he prepares to face charges related to alleged tax fraud.
The Manhattan district attorney's office is expected to unseal indictments filed by a grand jury around 2 p.m., though the exact charges are not yet known. Weisselberg will be arraigned later today at a lower Manhattan courthouse.
Previous reports alleged that the charges will likely revolve around company perks allegedly given to employees that were not properly taxed. The company's top executives were reportedly given private school tuition,..."

The monument is set to be moved to the Virginia Museum of History and Culture in Richmond after residing for 111 years in Washington.
The governor established the Commission for Historical Statues in the U.S. Capitol earlier this year to look into the removal and replacement of the monument. The commission was created following a wave of Confederate statue removals nationwide sparked by protests about racism and police..."

"Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse last week refused to apologize for his family's membership in a reportedly all-White beach club in his home state of Rhode Island, calling beach clubs ""a long tradition"" and saying he hopes the club will admit minority members soon. 
The senator's office on Monday denied that the club has discriminatory policies and said it does have minority members. 
Whitehouse, D-R.I., was asked about his family's membership in Bailey's Beach Club, officially known as Spouting Rock Beach Association, by GoLocalProv in a video that was posted on Saturday. The interviewer cited comments Whitehouse made in 2017 that..."
"""Jumped the shark” is an overused expression straight out of 1970s situation comedy. It is the most charitable interpretation of the moment President Donald Trump pressed “Tweet” on Friday morning. After nearly four months of the once jaw-dropping novelty of presidential tweeting (the equivalent, in dog years and media exhaustion, of five sit-com seasons), the routine has grown stale, the former reality-TV star apparently out of “don’t touch that dial” ideas."
"""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman and “Full House” alum Lori Loughlin were allegedly among the 50 charged in what is said to be the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department — but the star-studded suspects aren't the only details that have intrigued the public.
Bizarre details from a nearly 270-page complaint started to trickle out Tuesday, sparking a variety of reactions online.
California resident William Rick Singer was pinpointed as the ""ringleader"" of the scandal, allegedly helping wealthy parents get their children admitted to some..."
"After a month of sheltering in place, hundreds of millions of Americans will soon emerge from the new “normal.” Georgia, Colorado, and Alaska (among other states) are giving their residents some freedom to return to their old lives, with many “non-essential” businesses resuming operations. Plenty of public health advocates are concerned and have raised legitimate questions about the timing of such policies. But, done right, a cautious re-opening of America can lay the groundwork for renewed prosperity and lead to better health outcomes than continued, blanket stay-at-home orders. And a..."
"China and the World Health Organization (WHO) could have acted sooner to combat the coronavirus, a WHO panel on the origins of the disease in China reportedly announced Monday.
The WHO-backed Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) announced the finding in its latest report on the timeline of the pandemic, according to WION News. The WHO reportedly convened the IPPPR in July 2020 to investigate the timeline of the coronavirus pandemic.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been heavily critical of the probe, with the White House describing the..."
"Three Democrats were officially sworn in as U.S. Senators on Wednesday, hours after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, giving Democrats a majority in the Senate.
California Democrat Alex Padilla will take Vice President Kamala Harris’s Senate seat, Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff will take David Perdue’s seat, and Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock will take Kelly Loeffler’s seat. The two Georgia Senate runoff victories secured Democrats’ majority in the Senate. Harris swore the three Senate Democrats in.
The Senate will now be split 50-50, with Harris, giving Democrats the tie-breaking vote.

"Margaret Keenan, 90, reportedly said she felt “privileged” when she became the first person in the United Kingdom to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine early Tuesday in Coventry, England.
The BBC reported that the vaccine was administered at 6:30 a.m. GMT.
Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine were expected to be in place for the start of the immunization program on Tuesday, a day that Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II."

"President Biden on Friday called Chinese President Xi Jinping to request help cutting off Russia with sanctions and a ban on military supplies that could be used in Ukraine — but the call happened as China’s military provocatively sailed an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.
The video call lasted nearly 2 hours and ended at 10:53 a.m., the White House said.
It was not immediately clear if Xi had agreed to any steps to penalize Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government for its 23-day-old war in Ukraine amid heavy bombardment of major cities..."
"The final vote on Speaker John Boehner’s 1,603-page, more than $1 trillion omnibus spending bill is in jeopardy after members almost killed the bill on the rule. A total of 214 members voted for it, less than the majority of members in the House, but since all members weren't voting, the 212 against the rule wasn’t enough to kill it.
Time for voting had run out minutes before, and briefly the nays—those against the rule—had the majority. At least one Republican had switched a vote from being against the..."
"U.S. officials are on high alert for signs of a possible missile launch from North Korea in the coming days that officials have referred to as a “Christmas gift.”
A significant launch or nuclear test would raise the end of North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on missile launches and tests. It would also be a major blow to one of President Trump’s major foreign policy goals to get North Korea back to the negotiating table to eliminate its nuclear weapons."
"Senate Republicans plan to move quickly to consider the nomination of Rep. John Ratcliffe to succeed outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr on Monday said he talked to Ratcliffe Sunday to congratulate on President Trump’s decision to nominate him to the post.

"The Biden administration sold roughly one million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a Chinese state-controlled gas giant that continues to purchase Russian oil, a move the Energy Department said would ""support American consumers"" and combat ""Putin's price hike.""
Biden's Energy Department in April announced the sale of 950,000 Strategic Petroleum Reserve barrels to Unipec, the trading arm of the China Petrochemical Corporation. That company, which is commonly known as Sinopec, is wholly owned by the Chinese government. The Biden administration claimed the move would ""address the pain Americans are feeling at the..."

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday became the first Republican senator to publicly say he will object to the certification of the presidential election results when a joint session of Congress meets in one week to formally certify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory over President Trump.
Roughly a dozen Trump supporters in the House – led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama – have said they will challenge the slate of electors from six battleground states where Biden narrowly edged Trump in last month's election. But the challenge..."
"Georgia’s secretary of state this week announced he is set to remove some 100,000 names from voter rolls, the first major voting list maintenance following the 2020 election.
The names are being removed because of a National Change of Address form submitted to the U.S. Postal Service, election mail being sent to them bouncing back; or having no contact with elections officials for at least five years.

"President Joe Biden will unveil a $6 trillion budget proposal on Friday that would push federal spending to its highest sustained levels since World War II.
Biden’s budget plan asks the federal government to spend $6 trillion in the 2022 fiscal year and for total spending to hit $8.2 trillion by 2031, according to documents first obtained by The New York Times.
Should Biden’s budget be accepted by Congress, the federal government will spend more as a share of the economy each year than at any other time since World War II, with..."
"Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said Monday that President Obama has embraced a passive foreign policy that retreats from the bipartisan consensus that has governed for generations, and said that under Mr. Obama the United States no longer shapes events on the global stage.
Speaking at the Virginia Military Institute, Mr. Romney said in his campaign’s first major address on foreign policy that the world wants a strong America to underpin a stable world order, but he said with Mr. Obama in the White House, U.S. allies have been..."

Mrs. Clinton called for an end to racial profiling, alternatives to incarceration for low-level offenses and body cameras on police officers nationwide to help fix a justice system that she said was tilted against black men."
"Although Boris Johnson may have defused a ten-megaton bomb of neo-Marxism in Britain and assured the final passage of Brexit, his Conservative victory is hardly a victory for conservatism. On the far side of the Atlantic, as over here, fiscal responsibility has taken a lethal beating.

"U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 221,303 migrant encounters at the southern border in March, according to a Friday court filing by the agency, in the highest monthly total since President Biden assumed office.
The previous monthly high was 213,593 encounters recorded in July 2021, according to U.S. CBP data. Because some migrants attempt to enter the U.S. several times, the number of encounters can include multiple attempts by the same migrant.
Of the encounters recorded in March 2022, 209,906 were apprehended by the Border Patrol after crossing from Mexico into the U.S. illegally outside..."
"The Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a ban on taxpayer funding for religious schools, in a narrow but significant win for the school choice movement.
In the 5-4 ruling, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court essentially backed a Montana tax-credit scholarship program that gave residents up to a $150 credit for donating to private scholarship organizations, helping students pay for their choice of private schools. The state's revenue department made a rule banning those tax-credit scholarships from going to religious schools before the state's supreme court later..."
"Each year at this time, we fall prey to an assortment of opinions from our media overlords reminding us that we best not talk politics around the Thanksgiving dinner table, or at worst, “how to survive” if the topic is broached. Other articles give tips us how to politely offer alternative topics, while Politico, NBC, GQ, and even Bravo have decided Trump has already ruined your holiday.
But what do progressive media outlets have against us talking about the political issues that affect our families with… our actual families?

"When Benjamin Netanyahu addresses Congress on Tuesday, the Israel prime minister will call for a halt to President Barack Obama’s emerging nuclear deal with Iran, a step viewed by some as a bold act of principle and others as crude electioneering.
Since accepting Republican House Speaker John Boehner’s invitation in January, Netanyahu has clashed repeatedly with Obama, who said he would not be welcome at the White House during the trip. The 65-year-old leader refused appeals from Democrats to cancel the speech, saying the threat to Israel from a..."
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report details ten “incidents” in which President Trump sought to curtail or otherwise affect the direction of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Mueller’s report outlines the president’s attempts to intervene in the special-counsel probe to bring it to a premature conclusion or to affect the public perception of it by manipulating government officials’ statements. It stops short, however, of making a prosecutorial determination regarding whether Trump obstructed justice — a decision it indicates is best left to Congress.

"Congress spent the weekend insisting that it will reach a deal to raise the federal government’s borrowing limit by Thursday but making scant progress even as all sides tried to reassure itchy financial markets ahead of the stock market opening Monday.
Most of the action Saturday and Sunday was negative: Republican senators filibustered Senate Democrats’ proposal for a 15-month debt-ceiling holiday, and those Democrats in turn said they couldn’t accept Republicans’ compromise to reopen the government and extend the debt limit while making minimal changes to Obamacare."
"Frank Lautenberg, the last World War II veteran serving in the United States Senate, died of natural causes this morning at the age of 89:

"Senator Elizabeth Warren got a first taste of what it is like to be the front-runner on the debate stage Tuesday when her rivals ganged up on her and questioned whether her tax-the-rich rhetoric was too “punitive” for an already polarized nation.
The more moderate 2020 Democratic hopefuls took aim at Ms. Warren’s far-left agenda and plans for a wealth tax to finance a host of new benefits from tuition-free college to universal childcare.
“We need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think that Sen. Warren..."
"Republicans heading to the polls Tuesday for the final primaries ahead of November's midterm elections are poised to reveal the forces driving the party as it seeks to reclaim power in Congress.
The Senate primary picking a challenger to Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) is a classic case of populist insurgent versus conservative pragmatist. Don Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, and New Hampshire Senate President Chuck Morse both vow to oppose President Joe Biden’s agenda and place a GOP check on Democratic power in Washington. But while Bolduc promises to..."

"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) overrode its vaccine advisory panel early Friday and said people as young as 18 who have certain jobs or living situations may get a COVID-19 vaccine booster.
The recommendation means millions of more Americans may get a booster shot, even though experts during a meeting said there was not enough data to support boosters for many younger people.

"Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler confirmed Wednesday what many industry experts had already widely speculated: that he will recommend the strongest rules for the Internet that the agency has ever proposed.
The proposal to reclassify the Internet under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 would allow the FCC to regulate it as a public utility like phone service, barring Internet service providers from prioritizing Internet speed for some sites over others, among other controls."
"More than 1.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, further evidence of the devastation the coronavirus outbreak has unleashed on the U.S. economy.

"Democrats have labeled their major election overhaul the “For the People Act” — but when pollsters talk to the people themselves, many say they would rather take a pass.
As the Senate prepares to vote on the legislation Tuesday, Americans are deeply conflicted.
Tell them the legislation is about “voting access,” paving the way for easier registration and more convenient opportunities to cast ballots, and Americans are enthused. But tell them the legislation also overrides states’ voter-ID laws or spawns a new taxpayer-funded financing system for federal campaigns, and that warm feeling..."
"Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, said Friday that he was “sickened” by President Trump’s behavior as detailed in special counsel Robert Mueller’s newly released report.
The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee shared his reaction on social media after reviewing the sprawling report summarizing the special counsel’s investigation into the 2016 race and related matters.

"The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District announced Friday it has suspended its entire district police force, months after a shooting at Robb Elementary School left 19 students and two teachers dead, ABC News reported.

The Uvalde school board previously voted unanimously in August to fire district police chief Pete Arredondo over the botched police response.
On Friday, the district said it..."

"Preparing to withdraw U.S. ground forces from Syria, President Trump should pay attention to what happened after former President Barack Obama's hasty 2011 withdrawal from Iraq. Because Obama's withdrawal led to the increasing influence of Iran over Iraqi politics and thus invited Shia sectarian policies targeting Sunnis. In turn, these policies helped foster the rise of ISIS and led to Obama being forced to return forces to Iraq."
"The belief that Roe v. Wade (1973) is set to be overturned, based on a leak of Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Monday, is leading to questions about whether other well-known court precedents are at stake, particularly on LGBT issues. Will a heavily conservative Supreme Court rethink Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that made same-sex marriage recognition the law of the land? Would a conservative court go so far as to toss out Lawrence v. Texas, the 2003 decision that overruled state-level sodomy laws and essentially recognized a right to sexual autonomy and privacy among..."

"The U.S. military has plans to keep 1,000 troops in Syria, a change that comes months after President Donald Trump called for a complete withdrawal, according to The Wall Street Journal.
But mulitple media outlets, including Fox News and CNN are reporting that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford is calling the report ""factually incorrect."" Dunford says ""no change"" is being made to troop numbers.
Trump’s December 19 surprise announcement that American forces would leave Syria “now” ran into stiff opposition among members of his own party and led to..."
"The U.S. launched a sweeping cyberattack against the Iranian military last week in direct response to Iran’s downing of an American surveillance drone, U.S. officials told the Associated Press over the weekend, confirming that President Trump personally approved the retaliatory measures.
The response was aimed at Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the nation’s military that the White House officially labeled a terrorist organization earlier this year. The cyberattack targeted computer systems that control the Corps’ rocket and missile launchers, administration officials said."

"President Biden’s first time hearing directly from voters since taking office will be in a state he won by less than 1 percentage point, as he seeks to build support for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus package, a test of his promise to govern and “unify” the country.
The president will pitch the need for a fifth pandemic relief bill in a CNN town hall on Tuesday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a state that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 before it flipped for Biden by a 0.6 percentage point margin..."
"About one-fifth of New York City’s firefighters were unavailable to report for duty on Nov. 1, most of them because they weren’t in compliance with the city’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement. The fire department (FDNY) suspended training and maintenance and still ended up understaffed, though it maintained that operations hadn’t been affected.
As of Nov. 1, when the mandate for city workers went into effect, about 23 percent of the city’s 10,000 to 11,000 firefighters remain unvaccinated. Many of them likely applied for medical or religious exemptions and wouldn’t have faced being put on..."

"The House and Senate will convene at 1 p.m. Wednesday for a joint session of Congress to certify President-elect Joe Biden's electoral win, and a group of GOP lawmakers intends to raise objections to the results.
The traditional tally of the electoral results from each state is the final stage in the selection of an American president. It's normally a lackluster procedure, but President Trump has changed that by calling on his GOP allies in Congress to fight for him until the bitter end."
"Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's decision to retire next year leaves no clear successor in his home state of Nevada, where a popular Republican governor appears reluctant to change jobs and the pending loss of Reid's clout in Washington is causing anxiety over who might replace him.
As of Friday, the list of potential candidates came down to Gov. Brian Sandoval and everyone else. The political centrist who was easily re-elected last year is likely to face intense pressure from national Republicans and business interests to pick up where Reid..."
"President Donald Trump floated a false theory about presumptive Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris from the White House briefing room podium on Thursday.
Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis propagated the suggestion on ABC that Harris’ birth somehow disqualifies her from holding the presidency. Trump said he had “just heard” about the idea when asked to respond to the theory.
Harris was born in Oakland, California to immigrant parents and is qualified to hold the presidency. The new birtherism claim discussed by Ellis suggests that being born..."

The former NSA contractor was among 75 foreign nationals given Russian citizenship with the stroke of Putin’s pen.

"President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday called on Americans not to gather with extended families for Thanksgiving, saying it was a “patriotic duty” to limit the spread of COVID-19.
Biden said during an at times campaign-like speech in Wilmington, Del., that he and his family were setting an example by not celebrating the holiday as a large group.

"The Supreme Court this week will hear arguments in the most consequential abortion case since Roe v. Wade. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, presents the court with the opportunity to overturn Roe and correct one of greatest acts of judicial arrogance in history.   
The conventional wisdom is that overturning Roe would cause massive societal upheaval and indelibly damage the court’s legitimacy. In fact, the reality is just the opposite. Overturning Roe will only strengthen the court’s integrity, while perpetuating Roe’s constitutional error under outside pressure would confirm criticisms that the justices are behaving..."

"The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a Louisiana law requiring that individuals who perform abortions at clinics have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital is unconstitutional, as it places an undue burden on women seeking abortions.
The court ruled 5-4 in the case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, with Chief Justice John Roberts once again casting a deciding vote by siding with the court's liberal justices.
The majority opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, noted that the Louisiana law is ""almost word-for-word identical"" to a Texas law the..."
"White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Friday that President Joe Biden intends to sign executive orders instituting increased gun control.
“Yes,” Psaki flatly stated in response to a question on the subject during Friday’s press briefing. “I can’t give you an exact time frame in part, because they have to go through a review process, which is something that we do from here.”"
"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday confirmed that President Biden intends to sign executive orders on gun control.
Psaki replied “Yes” to a journalist’s question about whether reporters should “be expecting executive orders from the president on gun measures.”

"Today, as we seem so divided by our disagreements, we would do well to remember Reverend King’s words.
These are tough and divisive times. We’ve lived through a pandemic, riots, social unrest, and an often-toxic winner-takes-all political culture. There are those who seek to divide us by race, religion, political tribe, or even vaccination status. Civil disagreement — the quaint notion of viewing ideological opponents as decent neighbors who happen to disagree in good faith — is in short supply. No one seems to extend grace or the presumption of good..."

"Well Arkansas has officially become the state with the most restrictive abortion law and has made a case for life. The new law is a near-ban on abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy.

"The number of new applications for unemployment benefits fell by 28,000 last week to 187,000, the lowest level for initial claims since September 1969.

"Notwithstanding the landslide rejection of Obama and his policies in the mid-term election, I don’t think this will produce big changes in policy over the next two years.
Simply stated, supporters of limited government do not have the votes to override presidential vetoes, so there’s no plausible strategy for achieving meaningful tax reform or genuine entitlement reform.
But that doesn’t mean that there won’t be important fiscal policy battles. I’m especially worried about whether we can hold on to the modest fiscal restraint (and sequester enforcement) we achieved as part..."

"An ongoing behind-the-scenes skirmish between the White House and state governors on how best to handle Ebola cases is becoming even more convoluted as several states announce they are following New York and New Jersey in ordering quarantines and other precautions that go well beyond federal guidelines -- and run contrary to Obama administration recommendations.
The many, varying state policies already are sowing confusion, and creating a patchwork of policies. In the case of a nurse returning from Africa, for instance, who complained about her treatment at the hands..."
"Former FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday said he doesn’t recall hearing that Hillary Clinton conjured a campaign to smear President Trump as a Russian colluder — but he does recall a discredited claim that Trump viewed a “golden shower” in a Moscow hotel.
Comey pleaded ignorance of Clinton’s alleged role in stirring the Russia controversy while testifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he doesn’t remember a Sept. 7, 2016, “investigative referral” to him that was revealed Tuesday."
"The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) declassified information indicating that former President Obama's administration knew of allegations that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was attempting to tie Trump to the Russia and distract from her email scandal before the 2016 presidential election. DNI John Ratcliffe informed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that the prior administration obtained Russian intelligence in July of 2016 with allegations against Clinton, but cautioned that the intelligence community (IC) ""does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian..."
"Twitter’s incoming CEO Parag Agrawal suggested last year that the company should “focus less” on free speech during an interview with Technology Review.
Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced Monday that he is stepping down as CEO and will be succeeded by Agrawal, who is the platform’s current chief technology officer.
Last year, Technology Review editor-in-chief Gideon Lichfield asked Agrawal how Twitter balances its efforts to combat misinformation with wanting to “protect free speech as a core value” and to respect the First Amendment. 
“Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but..."
"President Trump is optimistic Senate Republicans will approve a resolution Thursday that will serve as a vehicle for his administration's tax reform proposal.
""Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today, first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes, but who knows?"" Trump tweeted Thursday morning."
"Here are some of the public figures and institutions that Americans hold in higher esteem than the media according to Gallup:
Hospitals, Their child’s school and daycare centers, State governments, Their employer, CDC and NIH, Mike Pence, Donald Trump, Congress.
Only one institution that Gallup asked about, the media, had negative approval rating — sitting 19 points behind its archenemy Donald Trump. And there are likely many other people and places that the public has more trust in than journalists.
This reality is a disaster for a liberal democracy, and..."
"America’s top general on Tuesday vehemently defended his Jan. 8 phone call with Chinese military leaders, telling lawmakers that he was “certain” then-President Donald Trump wouldn’t order an attack on Beijing and wanted to convey that reassuring message to his Chinese counterparts.
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, pushed back on the narrative that he went around Mr. Trump out of fear the president might order an attack on China during his final days in office.
Some..."
"He's the man at the center of the world's most intriguing bout of diplomatic wrangling. Yet few can claim to have seen him.
Edward Snowden, more than a week after fleeing Hong Kong, supposedly remains in the Moscow airport's ""transit zone"" -- a place that to the rest of the world may seem more like the twilight zone with every passing day.
Reporters swarmed the airport last week after Russian officials said the infamous NSA leaker was still there, while claiming he technically was not on their territory..."
"I mean, are they this desperate? Is the liberal media that nervous about Trump winning again? Because it would seem that they are throwing all the things against the wall to slow the momentum. The Atlantic is the first batter up, peddling a totally unverifiable story that President Trump has mocked and denigrated those who have served and died for this country. Yeah, they actually thought this would stick. The U.S. Military loves Trump, by the way. I don’t really see the point behind this story other than some pathetic..."
"Former President Donald Trump knew the riot by some of his followers at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 would be violent but failed to stop the attempted coup, House Democratic impeachment managers argued Wednesday as they opened the prosecution of Mr. Trump in his Senate trial, a session that included gripping new security video of the deadly attack.
Using Mr. Trump’s tweets and public speeches against him, the Democrats laid out a timeline of the former president’s responsibility for inciting the riot through repeated claims of election fraud. They..."
"A group of 64 House Democrats pressed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to address the federal debt limit, arguing in a letter Monday that Republican opposition amounted to ""dangerous malpractice"" that could cripple the U.S. economy.
In the letter, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and his colleagues said Democrats backed efforts to raise the debt ceiling three times under former President Donald Trump. The lawmakers said McConnell should support a suspension of the limit to ""avert a manufactured crisis,"" noting he had warned as recently as last week that the U.S...."
"Yonhap also found no evidence of Kim enduring any medical hardships ongoing at North Korea’s embassy in Beijing and Chinese government sources told Reuters they, too, had no evidence of a medical emergency in Pyongyang.
Late Monday night, CNN – an American left-wing news network with a long history of publishing poorly-sourced or false news reports – published a story titled “U.S. Monitoring Intelligence that North Korean Leader Is in Grave Danger After Surgery.” The story cited anonymous officials “familiar” with news about Kim’s health who stated only that the..."
"President Biden’s current “predominant” COVID-19 symptom is a sore throat, and he is using an asthma inhaler for his cough, his doctor said Sunday.
The president, who contracted the uber-contagious BA.5 variant, “completed his third day of Paxlovid last night,” Dr. Kevin O’Connor wrote in a letter released by the White House, referring to the anti-viral drug treatment.
“His symptoms continue to improve significantly.
“His [runny nose], cough and body aches have diminished considerably,” O’Connor said. “His voice remains deep. … His oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room air.
“His symptoms will..."
"Former President Donald Trump used a rally speech in Conroe, Texas, on Saturday night to issue a warning to activist prosecutors who are continuing to pursue him in an attempt to discover unnamed crimes, more than a year after he left office.
Trump recounted all of the various efforts to investigate him since before he took office, including the “Russia collusion” hoax and other investigations, all of which found nothing except for an ongoing claim about “fringe benefits” in his business.
“This has been going on as long as you’ve known me...."
"President Joe Biden sought to deploy fiery rhetoric of his own as he addressed the country for the third time in two weeks amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's groundwork for a Ukraine invasion.
“Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belongs to his neighbors?” Biden asked from the White House's East Room. ""This is flagrant violation of international law."""
"More than 1,100 former Department of Justice alumni signed a petition calling on Attorney General William Barr to resign. They take issue with the fact that he instructed the U.S. Attorney’s Office to reverse their recommendation for Roger Stone to serve between seven and nine years in prison. According to the petition, Barr did not uphold the department's principle of ""apply[ing] the law equally to all Americans.""
We, the undersigned, are alumni of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) who have collectively served both Republican and Democratic administrations. Each..."
"In the Rose Garden yesterday evening, President Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order in the American cities if mayors and governors fail to do it.
In his brief speech, Trump said the appropriate things about the George Floyd case (he called it a “brutal death”) and about the legal process underway in Minneapolis (“justice will be served”). He was also right about the biggest victims of disorder being people living in poor communities, about the mix of Antifa and looters causing the mayhem, and the need..."
"Every Republican can be happy that there will not be a runoff election in North Carolina’s Senate race. While not all are thrilled that the nominee is state House Speaker Thom Tillis, the moderate favorite of the GOP establishment, his convincing win shows party unity and avoids an expensive, damaging 10-week runoff election. Democrats, meanwhile, can be uniformly glum that the GOP settled on a nominee quickly and one who sounds an awful lot like Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who has twice won handily in the light-red state. But rather..."
"Democratic presidential candidates have been blitzing the state of Iowa in a frenzied finish before voters cast their ballots in tonight's first-in-the-nation caucus. Four candidates are locked in a tight race.
The Democratic hopefuls have been hosting multiple events and covering hundreds of miles desperate to win over those last-minute votes. Thousands of Iowans and political tourists crammed into large venues to hear directly from candidates one last time ahead of Monday's vote.
After being stuck in impeachment hearings in Washington all week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) made up for..."
"Three White men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery were found guilty of federal hate crimes charges Tuesday in a Georgia courtroom.
The jury of eight White people, three Black people and one Hispanic person deliberated for less than five hours after a one-week trial.
Prosecutor Christopher Perras argued that Travis McMichael, his father, Greg McMichael, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan acted out of ""pent-up racial anger"" when they chased and killed Arbery, 25, after spotting the Black man on a jog near their homes in Satilla Shores, outside of Brunswick.
The men were..."
"The Senate voted 50-49 to pass Democrats’ $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package on Saturday, after a marathon session of voting on various amendments.
The bill was passed via budget reconciliation rules, which allow a simple majority to approve legislation in place of a filibuster-proof 60-vote threshold. The Biden administration had been pushing to pass the legislation before the week of March 14, when pandemic-related federal unemployment assistance is scheduled to expire."
"Here’s what we know about the omicron variant — next to nothing.
But that hasn’t kept officials — in liberal states and cities, of course — from once again declaring Draconian measures to address the COVID-19 virus, including mask mandates for every resident and business and requirements to provide proof of vaccination.
On Monday, California officials announced a statewide universal indoor masking mandate to last until Jan. 15. The same day, Philadelphia announced that proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be required to dine indoors at bars, restaurants, indoor sporting events..."
"Despite pledges by Republicans to take down ObamaCare, some still indicate there are parts in the president's controversial health care overhaul that could be preserved if the party ever got its wish of repealing the law.
Since the beginning, conservatives in Congress have been extremely vocal about their dislike of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.
Yet, as demonstrated by a recent proposal from House conservatives, they say they wouldn't just repeal the law -- they would replace it with one of their own."
"The House Jan. 6 select committee voted Tuesday night to recommend that Steve Bannon, a one-time top adviser to former President Donald Trump, be held in contempt of Congress over his refusal to cooperate with an ongoing investigation into the Capitol riot.
The panel’s unanimous recommendation will advance to the full House for another vote, which will occur Thursday. If approved, the measure will advance to the Justice Department, whose officials will make the final decision on whether to prosecute Bannon. The former Trump adviser could face a fine or a jail term of..."
"In a speech in Boston, First Lady Michelle Obama left behind talk of exercise and school lunches, exchanging it all for bald politics by claiming that under her husband the US economy is now better off ""by almost every economic measure.""
The First Lady appeared at the Strand Theater Friday to stump for Martha Coakley's campaign for Governor of Massachusetts. Coakley needs help badly, as even in blue, blue Massachusetts, the race between Democrat Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker is essentially a toss up.
In her remarks, Obama..."
"Russia is reportedly planning to purchase millions of artillery rounds from North Korea, an event some analysts take as a sign Western sanctions have crippled the Russian war effort, according to The New York Times.
Recently declassified American intelligence documents show that Russia is in the process of obtaining short-range rockets and artillery shells from North Korea and may complete additional transfers of North Korean military hardware in the future, the NYT reported. Officials said that Western sanctions and export controls had succeeded in hindering Russia’s ability to procure defense equipment,..."
"The U.S. government appeared to file proposed redactions to the sworn affidavit accompanying the FBI search warrant of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago property earlier this month.
The court docket notes a filing by the Department of Justice under seal. The department faced a noon E.T. deadline set by the judge.
The Justice Department has previously warned that releasing detailed information in the affidavit would jeopardize its ongoing investigation into documents stored on former President Donald Trump’s private property, and possibly endanger witnesses interviewed by the government."
"Speculation about a White House bid for Vice President Biden intensified Saturday when he made an unscheduled weekend trip from his Delaware home to his Washington residence, reportedly to see Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Democrats in past months have called for the Massachusetts senator to seek the party nomination, convinced that her progressive, Wall Street-reformer message was good enough to defeat front-running Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Warren has so far decline. However, Clinton’s slipping polls numbers amid an email controversy has rais"
"Prosecutors in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse so far have a case that comes down to this: What if the things our witnesses say they saw and thought during that fateful night of rioting last year are all wrong?
If this were a legitimate murder trial, and not one instigated by Democrats and the media for political purposes, that’s the kind of argument that a defense team would be making. It’s a concept otherwise known as “reasonable doubt.”
But in a very weird turn of events, it’s lawyers for the state of Wisconsin who are..."
"Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade County after the Champlain Towers South apartment building collapsed in Surfside.
County Mayor Daniella Levine had also declared a state of emergency and asked the governor do the same in order to receive streamlined state resources for the recovery effort, which was still underway as of Thursday evening, hours after the collapse.
President Biden also said earlier in the day that the federal government and FEMA were prepared to provide further assistance once DeSantis formally declared the emergency."
"The Biden administration said Monday that hospitals must ensure patients can receive abortions when deemed medically necessary in emergency situations in spite of bans in many states on the procedure in most cases.
The Department of Health and Human Services said a federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, stipulates that physicians must perform an abortion in an emergency regardless of state law.
""Under the law, no matter where you live, women have the right to emergency care — including abortion care,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Today, in no uncertain..."
"The tentative Iran nuclear agreement that the Obama administration celebrated as a major step forward just one week ago was thrown into serious doubt Thursday, as the U.S. and Iran fell into a public dispute over exactly what was agreed.
The fight called into question whether any understanding exists at all, and whether there’s any way to bridge their vast public differences by June 30, the target date for a final agreement."
"Despite Joe Biden being projected as the next president-elect, President Trump is pushing forward with legal challenges as vote tallies continue, and Republican leaders have largely avoided weighing in on the latest developments.
Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, estimated his team will have four or five lawsuits over alleged voter fraud in battleground states by the end of the week and said Trump is right not to concede on Sunday.
""It really would be wrong for him at this point it be wrong for him to concede,"" Giuliani told ""Sunday..."
"White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that the 2020 G-7 summit will be held at one of President Trump's properties, despite opposition to Trump steering funds to his own business.
The summit will be held at the Trump National Doral Miami, Mulvaney told reporters at a White House briefing. He said the Trump property was the best possible facility and that Trump's business would not earn a profit.
""They are doing this at cost ... it will be dramatically cheaper for us to do it at..."
"Billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos blasted off to space in his company Blue Origin’s first manned flight on Tuesday, over a week after Richard Branson reached sub-orbital space in his own craft.
Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket launched on the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, aiming to reach about 66 miles above the Earth’s surface. Also on board the rocket were Bezos’s brother Mark, aviation pioneer Wally Funk, and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen, who was initially scheduled to board Blue Origin’s second space flight.
The New Shepard is fully automated, meaning..."
"After Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) proposed an amendment Tuesday to the rules for President Trump’s impeachment trial in order to subpoena witnesses and documents from the White House, it failed in a party-line vote.
All 53 Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate voted against Schumer’s amendment, which asked for any records created by former national-security adviser John Bolton, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Mulvaney aide Robert Blair regarding the White House’s dealings with Ukraine.
The current rules proposed by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.)..."
"The Biden administration on Tuesday said it wants to cap the amount of nicotine allowed in cigarettes as part of an effort to stem addiction and reduce smoking-related deaths.
The initiative — which is sure to face pushback from the tobacco industry — was announced as part of the White House’s list of planned federal regulatory actions, released twice a year.
“This proposed rule is a tobacco product standard that would establish a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and certain finished tobacco products,” the administration said.
Noting that “tobacco-related harms” primarily result..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that companies cannot patent parts of naturally-occurring human genes, a decision with the potential to profoundly affect the emerging and lucrative medical and biotechnology industries.
The high court's unanimous judgment reverses three decades of patent awards by government officials. It throws out patents held by Salt Lake City-based Myriad Genetics Inc. on an increasingly popular breast cancer test brought into the public eye recently by actress Angelina Jolie's revelation that she had a double mastectomy because of one of the genes involved in this..."
"President Trump, who as a candidate often criticized the government’s jobs’ reports during the Obama administration as “phony,” became a believer on Friday.
The Labor Department, now part of the Trump administration, reported Friday that employers added 235,000 jobs in Mr. Trump’s first full month in office, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 4.7 percent."
"Something on television caught the attention of Stacy Langton, a mother of six living in northern Virginia, when she was cooking dinner for her family in mid-September 2021.
“Write a sex scene you wouldn’t show your mom; write an X-rated Disney scenario,” read the TV news reporter, showing prompts given to students of a writing class at a public high school in Hudson, Ohio.
“What the heck is going on?” Langton said to herself.
All her children went to Catholic schools before high school, so she didn’t have much experience with public..."
"The Biden administration will begin allowing Central American asylum-seekers who had been forced to remain in Mexico into the United States to have their claims heard.
The Department of Homeland Security announced Friday that starting Feb. 19, the thousands of migrants who had been forced to wait in Mexico for months under the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols will be allowed into the U.S. for processing. Approximately 25,000 asylum-seekers have open, undecided cases and will be brought in.
“As President Biden has made clear, the U.S. government is committed to..."
"A twice-convicted felon who allegedly voted while on probation was arrested and charged in Houston earlier this week. 
Convicted felons are not eligible to vote in Texas until they are ""fully discharged"" of their sentence, including probation.
""I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion,"" Hervis Rogers told KPRC 2 back in March 2020, during the Democratic primary on the campus of Texas Southern University. ""I wasn’t going to let nothing stop me,"" he added.
Rogers had a Harris County voter registration card and even waited in line to cast his ballot for seven hours. ..."
"The Dow fell by more than 400 points after the opening bell on Monday, extending Wall Street’s losing streak as investors took stock of rising yields on government bonds as well as economic slowdowns in China caused by the ongoing pandemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 420 points, or 1.28%, while S&P 500 was trading lower by 1.64%. The Nasdaq fell 2% after trading opened on Monday."
"President Biden announced his administration will meet its goal of administering 100 million COVID-19 shots in his first 100 days on Friday, the 58th day of his term.
In an address on Thursday, he said the latest statistics showed that 99.2 million vaccinations had been delivered so far.
He credited his use of the wartime Defense Production Act, a deal between pharmaceutical rivals, and the success of pop-up mobile vaccination sites for reaching the target early but urged people not to let down their guard.
""This is a time for..."
"It's almost the perfect tweet for press coverage of the Trump administration. A Trump administration official makes a claim, poorly articulated, and a reporter wryly and snarkily reduces that argument to a stupid and overly simplistic format. The Hill — maybe the worst offender in this regard -- tweets out that reductive and misleading formulation, and it goes viral."
"Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney may have exchanged a tactical defeat for a strategic victory in Mondays foreign policy debate, losing on points to the president by most accounts but scoring a solid performance that left major pundits declaring he had passed “the commander in chief test in resounding fashion."
"Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration recommended on Wednesday that children ages 5 to 11 receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The FDA's advisory committee announced the decision after a study found that the benefits for children who receive inoculation far outweigh the potential risks of cardiac arrest symptoms, according to the Washington Post.
The panel voted unanimously to support the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children. Next, a group of advisers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to have a conference on Nov. 2 regarding the use of the vaccine for children, after..."
"OPEC+ pledged on Thursday to increase oil production further after resisting repeated calls by the Biden administration and other nations to do so to tame high prices.
The cartel, which includes nonmember Russia, committed to raising its collective production by 648,000 barrels per day beginning in July, a roughly 200,000-barrel-per-day increase from its recent monthly production increase targets.
The group's announcement said members took into account reopening from lockdowns ""in major global economic centers,"" likely referring to China. It also said it expects global refinery intake to increase following maintenance."
"Israel's attorney general has formally charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a series of corruption scandals.
Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued an indictment today charging Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and bribery. He was scheduled to address reporters later.
Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases, saying he is a victim of a political witch-hunt.
Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit disclosed his decision at a news conference at 7.30pm local time, a Justice Ministry statement said."
"When someone as sparklingly witty as Robin Williams commits suicide -- as the actor, once named the funniest person alive by Entertainment Weekly, apparently did last night -- our first reaction is disbelief at the incongruity. Perhaps it shouldn't be. Psychologists believe that some styles of humor can mask a greater susceptibility to depression. In fact, a certain sense of humor may be a symptom of a widespread, often untreated disease that disables and kills.

"During a Thursday interview on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) reacted to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) saying he favors allowing states to declare bankruptcy instead of a bailout from the federal government.
Scalise argued that instead of bailing out states that were having financial problems prior to the coronavirus pandemic, states should show they are “properly” spending the relief money from the CARES Act.
“Let’s keep in mind, we’ve spent trillions of dollars to try to keep our economy held together, to keep small..."
"President Biden Thursday reached the 100th day of his presidency, an unofficial benchmark often used to reflect on how well a president is adjusting to his new office and whether he is fulfilling his campaign promises.
Biden's administration has gotten off to a fast start on a number of fronts. He proposed approximately $6 trillion in spending in three massive packages, issued a flurry of executive orders and has backed a variety of other causes, from D.C. statehood to voting bills.
The new president has had mixed results on..."
"As this great nation celebrates its 245th birthday, it is time to fight back, hard, against the critical race theory and 1619 Project lies claiming that the founding was motivated largely by racism and slavery.
When even the National Archives, the repository of the original Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, wastes huge amounts of time and money in a mendacious initiative adopting the 1619 Project’s slander of the founding and of the nation, it is clear that the battle for the truth of our nation’s origins must be joined.
The truth remains, as it was..."
"President Obama and other world leaders on Thursday hailed what they said was a breakthrough accord setting the stage for a historic agreement that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, even though Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium under the agreement and the schedule for easing international sanctions remains to be negotiated.
After 12 years of deadlock over Iran’s disputed nuclear activities — and a sleepless marathon of negotiations in Switzerland over the past week — Iranian and Western"
"U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest pace since August 2008.
The Labor Department said Tuesday that the consumer price index rose 0.9% in June, faster than the 0.6% increase in May. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting a 0.5% gain.
Used car prices spiked 10.5% last month, accounting for more than one-third of the increase. Additionally, energy prices climbed 1.5% month over month and food prices rose 0.8%.

"The White House appears to be framing a selling point to Americans skeptical of getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine shot as an annual booster like the flu shot. 
In a briefing Tuesday, Biden administration health officials discussed the matter while also outlining the rollout of a new booster shot, Stat News reported. 
""It is becoming increasingly clear that looking forward with the COVID-19 pandemic, in the absence of a dramatically different variant, we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual..."
"The NAACP and 27 other liberal groups on Thursday warned Democratic leaders not to back off of plans for higher taxes because higher taxes would improve racial justice.
The groups, which included the Movement for Black Lives and the National Immigration Law Center, made their case for large tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate‘s tax committees.
“We write to make clear how important it is to communities of color that Congress enact a robust budget..."

Trump announced the proposal alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during remarks in the East Room of the White House."
"During an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Anthony Fauci said a Covid-19 vaccine requirement for domestic air travel “should seriously be considered.”
Fauci argued that the justification for such a sweeping rule has grown amid the rise of the Omicron variant and given the precedent of recent restrictions that bar the unvaccinated from employment, patronizing certain business, and other activities.
“If you’re talking about requiring vaccination to get on a plane domestically, that is just another one of the requirements that I think is reasonable to consider. . . . There’s requirements..."
"The first debate of the 2020 presidential election on Tuesday night was fiery from beginning to end.
President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden attacked each other in starkly personal terms for more than 90 minutes as moderator Chris Wallace worked to get both candidates, but especially Trump, to follow the debate rules the candidates had agreed to.
The conversation ranged from the coronavirus crisis to the Supreme Court vacancy to health care. It's not clear how much substance voters could get out of the debate, however, as it..."
"Let's get you up to speed on this idiotic flap: As you're already aware, Mitt Romney has declined to publicly release more than two years of tax returns. He's not legally obligated to do so; nor are Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid, neither of whom have chosen to live up to the levels of ""transparency"" they're demanding of Romney. Frustrated by the Republican presidential candidate's refusal -- and clearly unperturbed by his own hypocrisy -- Reid began circulating a totally unsubstantiated rumor this week, suggesting that Mitt Romney is a..."
"President Joe Biden will sign two more executive orders on Monday to mark International Women’s Day with a focus on “gender equality.”
The president will sign an order to establish a “Gender Policy Council” in the White House to help focus on gender issues such as sexual harassment, equal pay for other genders, ways to combat “gender-based violence,” and “gender equality” issues across the world.
In 2019, former President Barack Obama created a White House Council on Women and Girls during his administration to focus on women’s issues.
But Biden’s..."
"A free speech rally organized by conservative activists in San Francisco on Saturday turned violent after alleged Antifa counter-protesters attacked the demonstrators.
Members of Team Save America organized the event at the United Nations Plaza to protest against Twitter, which they say suppresses free speech.

Politico reported that a group of four lawmakers—both Democrats and Republicans—have acknowledged being associated with companies that have received PPP loans. The businesses, according to Politico, are either run by the lawmakers’ families, or have their spouses in senior positions."
"The Supreme Court ruled Monday that states can penalize presidential electors that go rogue and do not vote for the candidate who won their state, also known as faithless electors.
The decision was unanimous from the high court and a blow to a Democratic-aligned movement to chip away at the Electoral College.
The court in Chiafalo v. Washington and Colorado Department of State v. Baca evaluated legal challenges to state laws that required electors to follow the will of their state’s voters."
"Prince Andrew had his bid to get a civil case which alleges he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre dismissed by a U.S. judge on Wednesday.
The BBC reports his lawyers said the case should be thrown out, citing a 2009 deal she signed with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But a New York judge ruled the claim could be heard.
Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.
The motion to dismiss the lawsuit was outlined in a 46-page decision by Judge Lewis A Kaplan of the United States District Court for the Southern..."
"Chinese police ""beat"" citizens who gathered to protest against having their bank accounts frozen due to COVID-19 policies on Sunday, according to protesters.

The official Google Trends social media account tweeted that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had the greatest increase in searches on their online engine.
Ten of the Democrats that met the qualifications for the debate battled it out in the first of two debates in Miami, Florida."
"On the menu today: The late comedian George Carlin used to joke: “Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?” There’s probably a perspective at work in how people respond to the ongoing pandemic — you most likely know someone who seems to be paranoid and overreacting, and you probably also know someone who seems to be taking unwise risks.

"Earlier this year, the Associated Press announced a guideline change encouraging news reporters to call out racism. This might sound reasonable enough, but several media outlets just proved it’s the start of a troubling trend in journalism.
“Do not use racially charged or similar terms as euphemisms for racist or racism when the latter terms are truly applicable,” the Associated Press announced in a series of tweets. “If racist is not the appropriate term, give careful thought to how best to describe the situation. Alternatives include racially divisive, racially sensitive,..."
"Send five? send none? send one? With House Speaker John Boehner expected to announce the Republican members of the newly established Benghazi Select Committee today, House Democrats are fretting over a politically crucial call on whether to boycott the panel’s investigation or participate on some level.

"After two years of investigation and thousands of subpoenas and witness interviews, Special Counsel Robert Mueller confirmed that that the Russian government sponsored efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, but didn't find that the Trump campaign or the American people colluded with them, Attorney General William Barr said Thursday.
Further, after reviewing the ""facts and legal theories"" outlined in the report, Barr said in a press conference before the report's release, he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that the evidence developed for the report was not..."
"Thousands of Haitian migrants who were camping out at the small Texas border town of Del Rio have been released into the US, a new report said — even as the Biden administration has warned that those who cross into the country illegally will be sent back home.
In recent days, Haitians have been freed on “a very, very large scale” and given notices to appear at an immigration office within 60 days, a US official told the Associated Press.
Another US official who spoke to AP corroborated the release of a large..."
"It is still unclear what exactly Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) Jan. 6 committee is trying to accomplish, but a bipartisan group of 16 senators proved this week the body’s work is not necessary to reach real, productive, commonsense electoral reform.
Negotiated by Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Joe Manchin (D-WV), the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act is perhaps most praiseworthy for what is not in it. Specifically, all of the highly partisan and harmful provisions of the Democrats' preferred electoral legislation — The For the People Act, which would have banned voter..."
"U.S. employers hired less workers than expected last month as supplemental unemployment benefits expired. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 workers in September as the unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting the addition of 500,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate to slip to 5.1%.

"The U.S. economy continued to see healthy job growth in May, indicating the labor market is still strong despite growing fears of a recession amid sky-high inflation and an increasingly aggressive Federal Reserve. 
Employers added 390,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, beating the 328,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 3.6%, the lowest level since February 2020.

"Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey held onto his Senate seat, defeating a rising star from the Kennedy dynasty in the deep blue state’s Democratic primary Tuesday.
Rep. Joseph Patrick Kennedy III, who currently represents the state’s 4th Congressional District, called Mr. Markey to concede the race about two hours after polls closed, according to multiple reports.
It marked the first time in history that a member of the Kennedy family lost an election in the Bay State. Mr. Kennedy, 39, is the grand-nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the late..."
"St. Louis authorities confiscated an AR-15 used by Mark McCloskey, who made headlines with his wife Patricia last month when they defended their historic mansion from protesters who had broken down a gate to trespass on their private road.

"It's a disastrous week for UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but it may get worse yet. May scrapped a vote for the Brexit deal she helped craft in Brussels on Tuesday once it was clear she did not have the support to see it through. She admitted it would be soundly rejected, even by members of her own party. Conservative MPs are particularly irate that the drafted Brexit agreement includes an unpopular Irish border ""backstop."""

""It is with extreme sadness that we can confirm that 1 student at the STEM School was killed in..."
"America’s private employers added just 235,000 jobs in August, significantly undershooting market expectations and fueling speculation that the weak signal in the labor market recovery may lead the Federal Reserve to delay tapering of stimulus.
The Labor Department’s jobs report, released Sept. 3, shows that non-farm payroll employment rose by 235,000 in August, down from 943,000 jobs added in July and far below the FactSet-provided consensus forecasts of 750,000.

"Biden's bombshell weed announcement is both bigger and smaller than it might seem. On Thursday afternoon, President Joe Biden announced that he would be pardoning some federal convictions for marijuana possession and urged states to do the same. He also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra to initiate a review of how marijuana is classified under federal law. ""Sending people to jail for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives – for conduct that is legal in many states,"" Biden tweeted. ""Today,..."
"CBS News moderators got slammed for failing to keep Tuesday night’s Democratic primary debate on track, as the event descended into chaos.
The seven candidates on stage in Charleston, South Carolina, spent much of the debate steamrolling each other, yelling out answers and going over their 75-second time limit to answer direct questions.
Viewers were quick to pile on the moderators — Gayle King, Norah O’Donnell, Margaret Brennan of “Face the Nation” and correspondents Major Garrett and Bill Whitaker — for struggling to keep control.

"The Biden administration has ordered federal immigration enforcement agencies to nix the use of terms like “illegal alien” and “assimilation” when referring to illegal immigrants, in favor of more “inclusive language,” according to a report on Monday.
The new directive was included in a memo sent to the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection as part of an effort by the Biden White House to build a more “humane” immigration system, the Washington Post reported, citing copies it obtained.
According to the document, “alien”..."
"Two federal health officials warned the Biden administration on Thursday that the COVID-19 booster plan the White House outlined earlier this summer might not be possible because of insufficient data, The New York Times reported Friday morning. 
The officials, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and FDA acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, made the comments in a meeting with White House pandemic coordinator Jeffrey Zients. From The New York Times: 
Among the reasons for delaying is that regulators need more time to decide the proper dosage for a possible third Moderna shot. The..."

"Critics flamed the Los Angeles Times editorial board over the weekend for arguing that California's last remaining nuclear power plant needed to be closed in the name of doing even more to fight climate change. 
In a Sunday editorial, the board criticized those advocating for the plant to remain open despite the plant operator's 2018 decision to shut down, and implored California's state government to get other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, in place to prevent an increase in the use of natural gas following the plant's closure...."

Dawn Wooten, a licensed practical nurse, said the rate of the procedure at the Georgia facility was a red flag, said one particular gynecologist was at the center of the operations, and said some of the women didn’t understand why they were getting it.
She called the doctor “the uterus collector.”"
"New York’s nursing-home death toll from COVID-19 may be more than 50 percent higher than officials claim — because Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration hasn’t revealed how many of those residents died in hospitals, state Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.
In a damning, 76-page report, James also said that some unidentified nursing homes apparently underreported resident fatalities to the state Department of Health and failed to enforce infection-control measures — with more than 20 currently under investigation."
"House Speaker John Boehner showed he was a ""real leader"" by pushing through a vote on a clean debt ceiling bill, Rep. Peter King said Wednesday.
""He was a real leader,"" the New York Republican told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""I stand by what John Boehner did.""
With narrow Republican support, the House on Tuesday approved a debt ceiling increase without conditions. The bill allowed an extension of the federal government's borrowing authority for one year.

"Thousands of anti-war Russian protesters took to the streets on Wednesday as hundreds of others packed their bags and fled following President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a partial military mobilization.
The move marks the biggest escalation since the invasion began seven months ago and was made following a series of humiliating setbacks as well as calls from pro-war nationalists who demanded that more resources be devoted to defeating Ukraine. The partial draft would force about 300,000 Russians into military service.
By early afternoon, more than 1,300 anti-war protesters had been detained in more than a dozen cities..."

"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday that the company will halt all political advertising on its platform, both on behalf of political issues and individual candidates. “A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet,” said Dorsey. “Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people.”
The policy will not apply to voter-registration drives. Will it apply to Black Lives Matter or Greenpeace? Will Twitter bar Planned Parenthood from advertising its abortion services? How will Senator Elizabeth Warren, who..."
"As Labor Day marks the traditional close to summer, President Biden's poll numbers are taking a hit.
Facing a barrage of bipartisan criticism for weeks over his handling of the turbulent U.S. withdrawal and evacuation from Afghanistan, and with a surge in new COVID cases due to the spread across the country this summer of the highly infectious delta variant, the president’s approval ratings are slipping.
Biden’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid 50s since taking office in late January. But his numbers started sliding last month, as the crisis in Afghanistan dominated media coverage..."

"Brexit came down to the wire but it arrived Thursday, with a new trade deal between the United Kingdom and European Union. Arguments about whether this is a good or bad deal for either side matter less than the fact that British voters have finally received what they voted for in 2016.
Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 and has been in a transitional period applying most EU economic regulations. The new deal governs trading rules when the transition ends on Dec. 31. The agreement provides for zero-tariff,..."
"Senate Republicans on Friday thwarted an effort to create an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, blocking legislation they believed would ultimately be used as a political weapon against them by Democrats.
Most Republicans refused to back the measure, depriving the Democrats of the 60-vote threshold needed to begin debate on the bill.
It was the first GOP filibuster of major legislation since the Democrats reclaimed the Senate majority in January.
Six Republican senators backed the proposal to cut off debate on the bill..."

In a 2-1 ruling, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that mail-in ballots in Minnesota must be received by Nov. 3 in order to be counted. The court ruled that Minnesota secretary of state Steve Simon violated the Constitution when he attempted to extend ""the deadline for receipt of ballots without legislative authorization.""

Documents gradually started being released online just after the noon deadline, including an exhaustive explanation for why so much of the official affidavit would be in parts completely blacked out.
The eagerly awaited release came after the department had tried to fight it, insisting it comprised key details that were “highly likely to compromise future investigative steps” into whether the 45th president illegally kept classified..."
"The United States confirmed more than 83,000 new coronavirus infections Friday, the highest total of the pandemic.
The weekly average number of new cases reported each day has risen steadily since the first week of October, from about 43,000 to more than 61,000 as of Friday, COVID Tracking Project data shows. The previous record-high weekly average was exactly a month ago, with more than 67,000.

"Donald Trump on Thursday reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination for president, completing an unlikely rise that has upended the political landscape and sets the stage for a bitter fall campaign.
Trump was put over the top in the Associated Press delegate count by a small number of the party’s unbound delegates who told the AP they would support him at the convention. Among them is Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard.

"The White House said Americans should feel confident in the election system despite a Kremlin-linked entrepreneur’s apparent admission that Russia interfered in U.S. elections and will continue to do so.
While Yevgeny Prigozhin’s remarks on the eve of the U.S. elections on Tuesday are concerning, they come as not “new or surprising,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.
“It’s well documented and in the public domain that entities associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin have sought to influence elections around the world including the United States,” she said. “It’s not surprising that Russia would be highlighting their attempted efforts..."

"House Democrats released a report Tuesday outlining the case for impeachment against President Trump, drawing on evidence from past testimony to illustrate the president’s abuse of power.
“President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign,” the 300-page report argues.
Democrats also highlight the repeated efforts by the White House to refuse subpoenas and withhold information as unprecedented. “It would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of..."

"House Democrats are pondering impeaching President Trump for inciting last week's Capitol riot. But before that, they are trying another route, with a nonbinding resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to lead a palace coup.
Citing Section 4 of the Constitution’s 25th Amendment, Democrats propose and the House will soon vote on a measure calling for just that — for Pence to assume power, ousting his boss. This is a gimmicky attempt to shirk congressional responsibility, and it represents a threat to the constitutional order that is different from,..."

"It may be the Omicron variant — not any particular government policy or public health strategy — that ultimately “shuts down” the COVID-19 pandemic, according to experts.
There’s ample evidence that Omicron is a milder strain of COVID-19 than previous versions, such as Delta. Several doctors and health experts who spoke with the Daily Caller said that a more infectious, less deadly form of COVID-19 spreading rapidly throughout the population could ultimately result in a post-pandemic state of widespread natural immunity.

"It’s another Fauci flub.
The National Institutes of Health has stunningly admitted to funding gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at China’s Wuhan lab — despite Dr. Anthony Fauci repeatedly insisting to Congress that no such thing happened.
In a letter to Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) on Wednesday, a top NIH official blamed EcoHealth Alliance — the New York City-based nonprofit that has funneled US funds to the Wuhan lab — for not being transparent about the work it was doing.
NIH’s principal deputy director, Lawrence A. Tabak, wrote in the letter that EcoHealth’s “limited..."

"The United States is a land of propositions. One of those propositions is that no man — not even the president — is above the law. Another proposition is that those who temporarily wield power must not use it to harass or disadvantage their political opponents. Occasionally, these propositions can come into tension. Monday night’s FBI search of Mar-a-Lago provides us with one of those occasions.
There is nothing wrong per se with the investigation or prosecution of political figures. Indeed, that the most powerful and popular people in the country may be..."

Florida senator Rick Scott has an advanced degree in winning Hispanic voters as a Republican.
It has buoyed him in all his races, most recently his victory in his 2018 Senate race after serving two terms as governor, so he seems a logical person to ask about President Donald Trump’s eye-popping improvement among Hispanics in Florida.

The outcome, which was widely expected, could prompt House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to subpoena Trump's tax records as the opening salvo to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Neal set a final 5 p.m. EDT deadline for the IRS and Treasury to..."
"The White House on Friday announced a $13 billion aid package for Puerto Rico, three years after the territory was hit by Hurricane Maria.
""Under the leadership of President Trump, FEMA will award almost $13 billion to help rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical grid system and spur recovery of the territory’s education system—the largest obligations of funding ever awarded,"" the statement from the White House said, adding that it includes a federal share of $11.6 billion for the projects.
""Together, these grants exceed the total Public Assistance funding in any single..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she won’t agree to a narrow bill to bail out the struggling airline industry, telling reporters it would have to be part of a much bigger package.
Pelosi, a California Democrat, contradicted reports that she held talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a measure that would provide $25 billion to the airlines, which have seen a steep decline in business due to the coronavirus and the subsequent stalling of the economy.
“It’s not going to happen,” Pelosi told reporters who asked about the talks...."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday told the Des Moines Register editorial board that he would not testify in a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump.
""The reason I wouldn't is because it's all designed to deal with Trump doing what he's done his whole life, trying to take the focus off him. The issue is not what I did, not a single person, not one, not a single person, even that thug Guiliani and his (inaudible) compatriots, have said I did anything other than my job,""..."
"""Look across that region today, and what do we see? The slaughter of brave dissidents in Syria. Mobs storming American embassies and consulates. Iran four years closer to gaining a nuclear weapon. Israel, our best ally in the region, treated with indifference bordering on contempt by the Obama administration,"" Ryan decried during his address at the 'Values Voter Summit' in Washington Friday morning."
"The newest health care and climate spending bill from Democrats includes an $80 billion boost to the Internal Revenue Service that is intended to help the agency crack down on wealthy tax cheats. However, Republican critics say that a bigger IRS could ultimately hurt lower-income Americans.
Providing the IRS with an influx of funding has been a top priority for President Biden. It has emerged as one of the most prominent financiers of the Inflation Reduction Act that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., unveiled last week.

"The Biden administration has announced another round of military support for Ukraine as it fights off the Russian invasion.
The Pentagon has approved an additional $775 million in aid, which includes ammunition, surveillance drones, and anti-mine vehicles.
The news was leaked to the press late Thursday, with the additional funding authorized through the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows President Joe Biden to authorize the transfer of excess weapons. It was the 19th equipment drawdown for Ukraine since August 2021.
The United States and other Western countries have poured billions into supporting Ukraine since the war began in February,..."

"The purveyors of fake news at CNN are convinced, just as they were four years ago, that they have this presidential election in the bag. Donald Trump is done, and Joe Biden is headed for a landslide, just like Hillary Clinton was.
At this point, they have zero credibility left.
As before, CNN’s confidence is severely misplaced — and we’re going to prove it. The best evidence they can present are polls that suffer from exactly the same flaws as the ones that indicated a landslide victory for Clinton in..."
"Trading halted briefly on Wall Street Monday morning after a rout of stock prices caused a selloff of more than 7% due to fallout from the coronavirus.
The 15-minute halt followed rules implemented after the stock market plunge of 2008-09.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,800 points after the opening bell. The markets also are being affected by plunging oil prices.
Trading resumed after the 15-minute “circuit breaker,” and the selloff continued.
Markets in Europe were also down about 7% on Monday."
"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Sunday called Dr. Anthony Fauci an ""unelected technocrat who has distorted science and facts in order to exercise authoritarian control over millions of Americans"" after Fauci blasted Cruz for suggesting he be investigated for statements he made about COVID-19.

The lawmaker also called for the Justice Department to investigate Fauci for making false statements to Congress.

Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon said he believed the so far unidentified officer intended to reach for a Taser but mistakenly grabbed her service weapon and deployed a single bullet. Both the chief and Mayor Mike Elliott declined to release the officer's name at this time but said the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension should be releasing information about all..."
"President Biden will finally hold his first press conference on March 25, according to the White House.
It will bring and end to weeks of questions about why he is the first president in a century not to hold a solo question-and-answer session in his first 50 days. And it comes as analysts warned that the delay only raised expectations and the risk of an embarrassing ""gotcha"" moment.
Officials defended his actions, saying he took questions more than 40 times in other settings and that he had been focused on..."
"Two Democratic senators have backed off their threats to block President Biden’s non-minority nominees after getting reassurances from the White House that Asian American and Pacific Islander voices will be prominently heard in the administration.
The White House indicated late Tuesday it will add a senior level AAPI liaison.
A spokesman for Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Illinois Democrat, said the administration is committed to elevating AAPI voices, including “appointing an AAPI senior White House official to represent the community,” securing confirmation of AAPI appointments, and advancing policy proposals “that are relevant..."
"While all eyes were on the Nevada Caucuses, people in Super Tuesday states started receiving their absentee ballots. In places like California, voters are encouraged to vote absentee. It's been a way to garner greater political involvement and participation.
Adam Housley, a former correspondent for Fox News, said he received two ballots: one for non-party preference (NPP) and one for the libertarian ticket. What makes the scenario even more troubling? Housley said he has never registered as a libertarian.

"More than 2 million refugees from Ukraine have fled to neighboring countries in response to the Russian invasion, according to United Nations officials.
The latest tally comes well into the second week of the Russian invasion and follows previous efforts to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from the southern port city of Mariupol who were struggling amid the Russian attack.

"In the wake of reports that the Clinton Foundation may have been hacked, Hillary Clinton’s embattled foundation announced on Thursday that, if Clinton is elected, her foundation will no longer accept the kinds of foreign and corporate donations at the heart of the Clinton Cash scandal.
The new pledge is a stunning tacit admission of wrongdoing, but it comes too little too late and raises the obvious question: If it would be wrong for Hillary’s foundation to accept foreign cash as president, why wasn’t it wrong for Hillary’s foundation..."
"Monica Lewinsky, now 40 and 17 years removed from her affair with then-President Bill Clinton, is speaking out -- offering what could be uncomfortable details as Hillary Clinton is thought to be preparing a White House run.
Lewinsky has penned an account for Vanity Fair, excerpts of which were published Tuesday. In it, she recalls the humiliation she endured and accuses the Clinton administration and others of making her a ""scapegoat."""
"The momentum that helped carry the massive immigration overhaul through the Senate last month is beginning to fade, as House Republicans slam the brakes on the debate while rejecting the Senate's bill entirely.
The discontent in the House Republican caucus was evident in a closed-door meeting late Wednesday. Cheers erupted when GOP leaders said they would not take up the Senate-passed bill."

"While the full field of Republican presidential candidates resumed campaigning Friday, it was Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who emerged from last night's Fox Business debate the apparent main challengers to front-runner Donald Trump -- though New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's feisty exchanges may have left some thinking what was once a 17-candidate scramble, now is a four-man showdown.
Or, maybe five, as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who managed to get in a few shots at Trump, picked up the endorsement Friday morning of former candidate Sen. Lindsey..."
"“He knows the truth, I know the truth,” Michael Cohen told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos this morning, “many people know the truth.” In an exclusive interview on Good Morning America, Cohen declared that the real purpose behind the payoffs to Donald Trump’s mistresses was to protect his presidential campaign. “I knew what I was doing was wrong,” Cohen admits, and so did Trump:"
"You can always count on woke progressives to live up to the worst caricatures of their ideas. Democrats on the New York City Council have now removed a statue of the founder of the Democratic Party, Thomas Jefferson, from the City Council chamber in New York City Hall. The statue has been in City Hall since 1834 (eight years after Jefferson’s death), when it was erected to celebrate his advocacy of religious liberty. It is a sign of how proud Democrats are of their decision that they tried to block the press from witnessing..."
"One America News (OAN) is at risk of being completely blacklisted by the corporate left after Verizon Fios, the largest pay-TV network still carrying OAN, effectively blaclisted the conservative channel following pressure from leftist advocacy groups.
A channel carriage contract between Verizon and OAN was set to expire at the end of this month, and Verizon says it will not reach a deal with OAN to renew it.
Verizon’s decision came after relentless pressure from leftist organizations like Media Matters and Free Press, as well as Democrat politicians. It also..."
"Three current and one former members of the Texas Congressional Delegation are under an ethics investigation, along with six others, in connection with an all-expenses-paid luxury trip to the Caspian Sea, financed by an Azerbaijan state-run company. The trip, and other lavish gifts, were allegedly part of an effort to influence U.S. policy.
The ethics investigation is focused on a 2013 junket in which ten members of Congress traveled on the dime of Azerbaijan state-run oil giant SOCAR. In order to pay for the travel, while concealing the nature of..."
"In a somewhat surprising turn of events for the medical tyranny, Los Angeles County has abandoned its plan to reimpose indoor mask mandate as COVID cases and hospitalizations stabilize.
The county entered the ""high"" category two weeks ago when the average daily rate of COVID-related hospital admissions rose above 10 per 100,000 residents. As of last Thursday, the rate was 11.7 admissions per 100,000 residents.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said cases may have slowed, but he supports whatever health officials decide.

Avik Roy, a conservative healthcare policy expert whose work we have cited on many occasions is a big fan of the new proposal, taking to Twitter to declare it a legislative triumph. Agree or disagree -- and I'll do a bit of both below -- the profane, unhinged, substanceless replies from leftists accusing Roy of supporting murder, with more than a dash or two of..."
"Just before Detroit became the largest municipality to ever file bankruptcy, the failed city’s emergency manager, Kevin Orr, pleaded with top White House officials, including senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, for help.

"Only a decade ago, France’s two traditional major parties — the conservative Republicans and the Socialists — won 57 percent of the vote between them in the first round of the country’s presidential elections. On Sunday, both parties together won less than half that — only 26 percent. Emmanuel Macron, the 39-year-old independent who placed first in this year’s round, declared that the nation had “discarded” the two once-dominant parties."

No collusion with Russia, no charges of obstructing justice.

The president and his advisers didn’t have access to the confidential Mueller report, instead reviewing Attorney General William P. Barr’s summary that was also transmitted to Congress.
It said Mr. Mueller found no evidence..."
"Congressional Democrats passed legislation hiking the federal debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion in an all-night sprint to allow President Biden to continue borrowing money to pay for government expenditures until at least early 2023.
Senate Democrats narrowly passed the bill, 50 votes to 49, in the evenly split chamber before the Democratic House majority muscled it across the finish line early Wednesday morning. 
The bill, which Mr. Biden is expected to quickly sign, will push the national debt limit to $31.4 trillion from roughly $29 trillion.

"An ad released in the final hours of the campaign on Monday squarely focused on trying to split Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) from President Donald Trump. “Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, squaring off with President Trump,” a narrator says at the opening of the ad. “Expected to appoint Kelly Loeffler to the open U.S. Senate seat.”
The ad focused on trying to split Trump from Loeffler, by highlighting how Kemp—Georgia’s governor who Trump says he intends to back a primary challenger against in two years—appointed her to the seat vacated by..."
"At some point, annual remembrances of tragic events can get old. The 21st anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks might seem like a good time to let the anniversary go unremarked — never even close to forgotten, of course, but no longer treated as a front-burner topic.
A back-burner treatment, though, would be a mistake.
In addition to wanting to remember those who died and those who acted heroically, there is a very practical reason we should keep the terrorism on 9/11 fresh in our minds. We should do so..."
"The Justice Department has moved to withdraw its case against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, citing “newly discovered and disclosed information,” according to a new court filing.
The move, first reported by The Associated Press, comes less than an hour after the top prosecutor on the case, Brandon Van Grack, submitted his withdrawal from the case. The decision said that the White House interview Flynn gave to the FBI, which ultimately led to his guilty plea, was “conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.”"

Instead, the firearms deemed ‘assault weapons’ are fairly ordinary, popular, modern rifles. This is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes.”

"Ukrainian and Russian forces have engaged in street fighting in the city of Kharkiv (Kharkov) after an “intensive” artillery battle overnight.
Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv is known to many history buffs as the scene of a series of fierce battles between the Red Army and the German armed forces and Waffen SS during the Second World War, marked by large-scale tank clashes and bloody house-to-house fighting.
While much media attention has focused on the fighting near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv (Kiev) until now, Kharkiv — a key city just..."
"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.
Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and..."
"A Virginia state judge has ruled the city of Charlottesville cannot move two Civil War statues that were at the center of the riots in 2017.
After Judge Richard Moore issued his ruling Wednesday, plaintiffs that argued in defense of the statues are requesting $604,000 to cover attorney fees, plus $500 for each plaintiff.
The Charlottesville City Council voted unanimously in 2017 to move the statues after a Unite The Right rally for white supremacists led to riots and clashes between protest groups, in which one person was killed.
Moore..."
"Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a $1.2 billion tax relief bill on May 6 to help Floridians—especially families with children—fight what he called “Biden-flation headwinds.”
“This is actually the largest tax relief in the history of the state of Florida,” DeSantis said in Ocala, dwarfed by a wall of disposable diapers and surrounded by families with small children. “The tax relief you’re going to see is breaks for really critical needs like gas, diapers, disaster supplies, tools for skilled trades, and recreational activities. Families are going to be able to save for..."
"Rush Limbaugh, the monumentally influential media icon who transformed talk radio and politics in his decades behind the microphone, helping shape the modern-day Republican Party, died Wednesday morning at the age of 70 after a battle with lung cancer, his family announced.
Limbaugh's wife, Kathryn, made the announcement on his radio show. ""Losing a loved one is terribly difficult, even more so when that loved one is larger than life,"" she said. ""Rush will forever be the greatest of all time.""
The radio icon learned he had Stage IV lung..."
"The capital city of Lebanon experienced a massive explosion Tuesday afternoon, according to preliminary media reports.
Videos of the explosion in Beirut have been circulating online, and some of the videos show a ring moving away from the site while a large plume of orange-tinged smoke subsequently erupts into the air.
According to the Associated Press, the massive explosion appears to have occurred near the sea port, which connects the capital city to the Mediterranean Sea.
Videos circulating from purportedly after the blast show destruction in the city,..."
"President Trump said he stopped a planned U.S. military strike against Iran 10 minutes before it was to be launched Thursday night because the likely Iranian casualties were “not proportionate” to Tehran’s shooting down of an unmanned Navy drone.
“We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die,” Mr. Trump tweeted Friday, adding that a general told him 150 people would likely be killed.
“10 minutes before the strike I stopped it,” the president said. “I am in no..."
"Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated during an attack on his home, the country’s interim prime minister announced Wednesday.
The country’s first lady, Martine Moise, was hospitalized following the attack, though more details about her condition were not immediately available.
“The country’s security situation is under the control of the National Police of Haiti and the Armed Forces of Haiti,” Claude Joseph, the interim premier, said in a statement from his office. “Democracy and the republic will win.”
The interim premier characterized the assassination as a “hateful, inhumane, and barbaric act,” though he..."
"Conservative Twitter users slammed Democrats for having once claimed that updated Georgia election laws were ""Jim Crow 2.0"" after state election officials reported this week that early voting numbers this year smashed turnout in the 2018 midterms. 
In 2021, President Joe Biden, fellow Democratic lawmakers and major media outlets attacked a new Georgia election integrity law as an attempt by GOP officials to suppress the vote, particularly among the African American community. 
The Democrats were so pointed in their attacks on the legislation that Biden referred to it in March 2021 as..."
"President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order establishing the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative – a move the administration says will improve access Latinos have to educational and economic opportunities.
In a speech in the White House Rose Garden before signing the order, Trump touted the initiative as expanding school choice for Hispanics and one that would improve access to charter schools for students.
The initiative is also meant to create more career pathways for Hispanic students as well as boast investment in economically distressed communities, including Opportunity Zones,..."
"The Obama administration sought several cuts in funding for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other critical medical supplies -- although some of the reductions were relatively small, and most came after Republicans implemented a new law to restrict federal discretionary spending, records reviewed by Fox News show.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign has recently stepped up its attacks on President Trump's pandemic preparedness, drawing what could be one of the most consequential battle lines of the presidential race amid the coronavirus crisis. A..."
"President Joe Biden announced Thursday he plans to increase the cap on the number of refugees allowed into the US after his predecessor Donald Trump slashed it dramatically while in office.
Biden aims to raise the refugee cap to 125,000 — a stark rise from Trump’s 15,000 refugee limit last year — starting Oct. 1, according to The Washington Post.
“I’m approving an executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need,” the president said in a speech at..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is facing a Democratic reckoning as voters and politicians alike conduct a postmortem on what caused Democrats to shrink their majority in the House of Representatives.
Ahead of Tuesday’s election, House Democrats were poised to expand their majority in the lower chamber of Congress. Instead, voters chose to give House Republicans five new seats.
With hopes of a “blue wave” dashed, Pelosi’s ambitious legislative goals for the 2021 congressional calendar are in jeopardy as she faces the ever-increasing likelihood of a Republican-held Senate.
“It’s a dumpster..."
"A federal judge on Friday released a heavily redacted version of the FBI affidavit used to justify the search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, and we can’t help but wonder is that it? This is why agents descended on a former President’s residence like they would a mob boss?
It’s possible the redactions in the 38-page document release contain some undisclosed bombshell. But given the contours of what the affidavit and attachments reveal, this really does seem to boil down to a fight over the handling of classified documents. The..."
"On Thursday, responding to the U.S. Navy’s stated intention to remove naval officer Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin after President Trump had restored Gallagher´s rank to Chief Petty Officer last Friday, Trump fired back, tweeting, “The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!”
After Trump ordered the U.S. Navy to cancel demoting Gallagher’s rank from Chief Petty Officer to Petty Officer First Class, Navy commanders started to strip Gallagher of his..."
"Facebook knowingly chooses to prioritize its profits over the safety of its users, Frances Haugen, a whistleblower and former Facebook employee, said in an interview with “60 Minutes” on Sunday.
“The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” Haugen told Scott Pelley on “60 Minutes” Sunday night. “And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money.”
Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, leaked..."
"The Biden administration is working to end hunger and “diet-related diseases” by hiring more minority nutritionists, according to a White House plan released Monday.
The administration says that hiring more non-white registered dietitian nutritionists will help minority communities that experience higher rates of “food insecurity,” obesity and type 2 diabetes, according to the White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. The Health Resources and Services Administration will begin collaborating with Minority Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in 2023 to recruit and train a diverse crop of nutrition..."
"This is the eleventh consecutive week of initial claims above 1 million. Prior to March, initial claims had never risen as high as 700,000.
Economists had forecast 1.565 million claims. Last week’s claims were revised up slightly to 1.897 million from 1.877 million.
Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27. Each subsequent week has seen claims decline.
Continuing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ending May 30 fell 339,000 to 20,929,000. The previous week’s level was revised down by 219,000 from 21,487,000 to 21,268,000...."
"A top House Democrat and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) sued former President Donald Trump and attorney Rudy Giuliani over their respective speeches to supporters on Jan. 6.
“While the majority of Republicans in the Senate abdicated their responsibility to hold the president accountable, we must hold him accountable for the insurrection that he so blatantly planned,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in a statement. “Failure to do so will only invite this type of authoritarianism for the anti-democratic forces on the far right that..."
"All eyes in the political world will be focused Tuesday on the governor’s race in Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin is polling dead even or ahead of Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a blue state.
But the off-year Election Day will feature a number of other noteworthy contests that could provide clues as to the electorate’s mood ahead of the midterm elections next year.
Here are seven other races and ballot questions to watch:
Minneapolis City Question 2
Voters in Minneapolis will decide Tuesday if they want to abolish their police department and..."
"Attorney General Bill Barr has authorized a Justice Department probe of allegations of “voting irregularities” — despite little evidence of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election, a report said Monday.
The Associated Press reported the move by Barr Monday evening, but did not provide specifics on what the probe would focus on or what allegations they would investigate.
President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have repeatedly made broad allegations of voter fraud in a number of states, but have not provided evidence for their claims."
"A co-chair of the influential Congressional Progressive Caucus on Tuesday threw his support behind pursuing impeachment of President Trump, giving the movement another bump.
Rep. Mark Pocan, Wisconsin Democrat, said he was swayed by Mr. Trump’s obstruction of Congress’s efforts to conduct investigations into the president and his team.
“Regrettably, the president’s most recent actions and continued disrespect for the Constitution are forcing us down the road to impeachment,” Mr. Pocan said in a statement.
Mr. Pocan’s comments come as the impeachment debate among Democrats is heating up, with House..."
"President Barack Obama will call for increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans by raising the capital gains rate and eliminating a tax break on inheritances, then using the revenue to fund new tax credits and other cost-saving measures for the middle class.
The president’s proposals are likely to be cheered by the Democratic Party’s liberal base, but the tax increases are all but certain to be non-starters with the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill.
Obama will announce the tax proposals Tuesday night in his State of the Union address...."
"I wanted to like Paul Ryan. Before he was nationally known, Rep. Ryan visited me at ABC, and we went to lunch. He was terrific. He was a rare politician, one who actually cared about America's coming debt crisis and the unfairness of entitlements. He even talked about F.A. Hayek's ""The Road to Serfdom""! If only more politicians thought that way."
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk purchased a 9.2% stake in Twitter Inc. according to a Monday filing from the SEC.
Twitter's shares jumped more than 25% in price following Monday's news. Musk now controls nearly 73.5 million shares of the company, making him the largest shareholder, and individual stocks were priced at $49.81 on Monday morning.
Musk's purchase comes roughly a week after the billionaire criticized Twitter for a lack of commitment to free speech.
""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines..."
"The U.S. Senate on Friday struggled to pass a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would avert a looming federal government shutdown, postponing a vote until Monday when procedural hurdles begin to evaporate.
Negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to speed the process along collapsed during late-night talks in the nearly abandoned U.S. Capitol.
Barring any agreement to act in a more streamlined way, the Senate is on track to hold a procedural vote at 1 a.m. eastern time Sunday aimed at clearing the way for passage on Monday.
The breakdown in..."
"For all the reports of national Democrats drawing targets on enough Republican-held seats to recapture control of the House in 2014, the odds are strong that Republicans will hold on to their majority in the last mid-term election of the Obama administration.
The arithmetic favors the Republicans in the upcoming campaign, in which voters decide the fate of all 435 House members.
The current make-up of the House is 233 Republicans, 200 Democrats, and two vacancies. Upcoming special elections to fill the vacancies in Alabama and Massachusetts will almost give..."
"White House officials are asking the governors of four states to reverse their executive orders requiring the quarantine of medical workers returning from Africa. Governors Chris Christie (R-NJ) and Mario Cuomo (D-NY) reacted by standing by their decisions and blamed the federal government for not having strict enough guidelines.
The move by the White House comes after the governors of Illinois and Florida joined with Christie and Cuomo in"
"It is almost surely the case that President Joe Biden’s Afghan withdrawal was propelled by political considerations rather than any pressing moral or foreign-policy imperative. Biden, who for 20 years has taken whatever the most popular position happened to be on Afghanistan (so, all of them), believed he could get a quick, much-needed political victory.
You can still witness the cynical polling-centric takes from Biden defenders like MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who only this morning, a few hours before American troops were being murdered by suicide bombers at the Kabul airport, was telling his co-host Mika Brzezinski,..."
"Judge Bruce Schroeder shut down the Kyle Rittenhouse prosecutor’s questioning for a possible “grave Constitutional violation” Wednesday after the prosecution allegedly abridged Rittenhouse’s right to remain silent.
Prosecutor Thomas Binger was questioning Rittenhouse on his use of deadly force before he began asking Rittenhouse whether he has had the opportunity to listen to witness testimony, read articles about the case, or watch videos of the fatal interactions.
Rittenhouse agreed with the prosecution that he had intentionally used deadly force against Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber. Binger then asked whether Rittenhouse intended to kill..."
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday formally announced that Texas will build its own border wall, as he accused the Biden administration of abandoning its responsibility to protect the southern U.S. border.
""Today we are announcing that Texas will build a border wall in our state to help secure our border,"" Abbott said at a press conference. 
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday formally announced that Texas will build its own border wall, as he accused the Biden administration of abandoning its responsibility to protect the southern U.S. border.

"Kyle Rittenhouse, the baby-face teenage vigilante charged over the deadly Kenosha shootings, was a bullied high school dropout with two all-consuming fixations — cops and guns.
The 17-year-old accused killer dedicated his social media to his two obsessions, right from the cover of his now-deleted Facebook profile that had him posing with a high-powered rifle.
“Duty. Honor. Courage. Blue Lives Matter,” read a banner on his profile picture, a counter to the Black Lives Matter movement to instead show solidarity with under-fire cops."
"The US economy added 245,000 jobs in November — barely more than half the number economists expected — as the coronavirus’ resurgence hampered the labor market’s recovery from the pandemic.
The unemployment rate barely dropped to 6.7 percent last month from 6.9 percent in October amid the record-setting spike in infections, which has led to renewed lockdown measures in some parts of the country, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday."
"President Biden is prepared to announce executive actions to combat the threat of climate change, say lawmakers who have spoken to the president and are urging him to act unilaterally now that Congress’ negotiations on green energy legislation have fallen apart.
Mr. Biden is expected to announce steps he will take to reduce carbon emissions as soon as Wednesday when he visits the shuttered Brayton Point power plant in Somerset, Massachusetts, to talk about what he is calling a climate crisis.

"A third woman has gone public with allegations that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) made unwanted advances toward her, and has provided photos and text conversations with friends to back up her claims.
The New York Times reported Monday that Anna Ruch — a former Obama administration employee and Biden 2020 campaign staffer — says upon meeting Cuomo at a wedding in Sept. 2019, he placed his hand on the small of her bare back, which was exposed because of the design of her dress.
The outlet reported:

"United States Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles on Monday pushed back on reports he was fired by President Donald Trump.
""My departure from the U.S. Secret Service has been announced and is effective in May. No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my 'firing.' I assure you that this is not the case, and in fact was told weeks ago by the Administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security,"" he wrote in an email to employees, which was obtained by..."
"The economy added far fewer jobs than expected in April, just 266,000, and the unemployment rate rose slightly to 6.1%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
The jobs numbers indicate that the pandemic recovery is not proceeding nearly as fast as was hoped. Forecasters had anticipated that the economy would add nearly 1 million nonfarm payroll jobs and that the unemployment rate would drop from March’s 6% down to 5.8%.
""This might be one of the most disappointing jobs reports of all time,"" said Nick Bunker, who leads North..."
"The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee urged his colleagues to remain focused on the credentials of the president’s nominee to be the next Attorney General.
“She is the nomination for attorney general and that is why I’m focusing on her,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat.
Mr. Leahy’s comments came in apparent response to Republican focus on controversies at the DOJ including the ATF gunwalking scandal and defense of the presi"
"YouTube suspended Republican Senator Rand Paul for seven days on Tuesday night for posting a video disputing whether masks stop the spread of COVID.
'Most of the masks you get over the counter don’t work. They don’t prevent infection,' Paul of Kentucky said in the video which has been taken down.
'Trying to shape human behavior isn't the same as following the actual science, which tells us that cloth masks don’t work,' he added.
A YouTube spokesperson said Paul's claims in the three-minute clip violated their policy on COVID medical misinformation.

"Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba‘s Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution.
The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement Friday in a speech at the opening of the Eighth Congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.
He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.”

"Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, pleaded guilty to tax fraud charges Thursday as part of a deal that will require him to testify about the financial practices of the Trump real-estate empire that he helped run.
The executive and the company of former president Donald Trump were charged in July of last year with a 15-year tax fraud scheme, and were accused of collecting more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation, according to the Associated Press.

"After 146 years, the curtain is coming down on ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" The owner of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus told The Associated Press that the show will close forever in May.
The iconic American spectacle was felled by a variety of factors, company executives say. Declining attendance combined with high operating costs, along with changing public tastes and prolonged battles with animal rights groups all contributed to its demise."

"New York is showering taxpayer funds on a group that sends drag queens into city schools — often without parental knowledge or consent — even as parents in other states protest increasingly aggressive efforts to expose kids to gender-bending performers.
Last month alone, Drag Story Hour NYC — a nonprofit whose outrageously cross-dressed performers interact with kids as young as 3 — earned $46,000 from city contracts for appearances at public schools, street festivals, and libraries, city records show.
Since January, the group has organized 49 drag programs in 34 public elementary,..."
"President Obama's pledge to work with Congress on ""appropriate reforms"" for parts of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs came under scrutiny Friday from some Republicans and skeptical Democrats.
Surveillance programs that allow the government to collect basic information about phone calls and email communications have been under scrutiny since NSA leaker Edward Snowden revealed classified programs in June. The government has defended these programs as necessary to prevent terror attacks."
"While many of us turn to the government for answers to the COVID-19 pandemic, others rightfully seek solutions from the private sector. Last week, the Hoover Institution's Russ Roberts asked his many twitter followers to help ""create a list of voluntary (non-coercive) actions taking place right now to reduce COVID-19 spread or impact."" The answers are too inspiring not to share.
First, many of Roberts' followers shared a list the benefits offered by their employers that help to alleviate workers' financial hardships or ensure their health is protected. For instance,..."
"It’d be fitting if Democrats undertook a radical procedural step to pass a radical piece of legislation.
That’s what the Left is pressuring Senate Democrats to do by eliminating, or significantly curtailing, the filibuster to pass H.R. 1, the sweeping voting proposal that is one of the most execrable bills to pass the House in a very long time.
H.R. 1 would federalize the conduct of elections and codify what were supposed to be emergency voting procedures during the pandemic, in frankly partisan legislation sheathed in the rhetoric of “voting..."
"Rattled by recent polling showing Mitt Romney drawing roughly even with President Obama among female voters, Democrats are making yet another hard play over ""ladyparts."" American Crossroads is answering back with an ad blitz of their own, also targeting women. It seems conservatives view women as more than just uteruses. Weird, right?"
"Polling stations across Scotland are reporting huge turnouts in today’s referendum vote. The ballot boxes opened at 7am this morning and around 97 percent of the Scottish adult population have registered.
At Hermitage Park Primary School there were a steady stream of voters from the moment they opened. Campaigners from both the ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ sides were flooding the streets in one last attempt to persuade the undecided population: believed to have been 8 percent last night.
In advance of today’s vote experts had predicted a turnout of..."
"Well, Nancy Pelosi sure got an explosive reaction.
Not long after the House speaker accused President Trump of a ""cover-up,"" the president hastily assembled reporters in the Rose Garden to forcefully deny her charge, denounce the Mueller investigation once again and rip the press as well.
He had just stormed out of a meeting with Pelosi and Chuck Schumer about pursuing an infrastructure plan. Trump, in his impromptu remarks and in response to questions, made clear that he couldn't negotiate with the Democratic leaders in light of Pelosi's slam and..."

The 51-minute film shows a clip of Mr. Trump at a rally in December where he called for the U.S. to ban all Muslims from entering the country as his supporters cheered, according to reports from the SITE Intelligence group.
The image of the real estate mogul was sandwiched between two clips of al Qaeda leader..."
"The White House is contending opposition to its tax enforcement proposals, targeting amounts as small as $600, is based on banks being too lazy to deal with the extra paperwork.
The tax enforcement measures are aimed at helping pay for President Joe Biden's social welfare and climate spending package. The focus is on the wealthy rather than people with small bank accounts, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
""It should not be lost on anyone that the loudest opposition to these proposals and the biggest ad spending against..."
"House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the House ""absolutely"" will take up the new Senate budget plan -- even if he has to rely on mostly Democrats to pass it -- and that he expects the partial government shutdown to end by Thursday.

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took responsibility Monday night for any security failures leading up to the consulate attack last month in Libya that killed an the American ambassador, but she seemed to push back against claims of a cover-up, blaming the ""fog of war"" for the Obama administration's shifting explanations for the attack."
"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin received a 270-month prison sentence Friday for second-degree unintentional murder in the death of George Floyd last spring.
Minnesota District Court Judge Peter Cahill said a 22-page sentencing memorandum would explain his reasoning on the sentence in greater detail.
""Most of it’s going to be in writing, 22-page memorandum – to emphasize the fact that determining the appropriate sentence in any case and in this case is a legal analysis,"" he said. ""It’s applying the rule of law to the facts of an individual and specific case. As opposed..."
"The Department of Defense is in communication with Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX, over its contribution of Starlink mobile internet systems, which have been an invaluable asset for the Ukrainian military, but come with a massive cost.

"President Joe Biden’s administration has secured the purchase of an additional 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine, the White House announced Thursday.
The administration announced in January that it was “working to purchase” an additional 100 million doses each from Pfizer and Moderna. That effort is now successful, raising the total number of doses at the nation’s disposal to 600 million doses through the summer of 2021. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses per person, however, meaning the vault of doses is enough to cover 300..."
"Last week, Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell forced Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff’s hand. If the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee didn’t release the transcripts of 53 interviews from the committee’s Russia collusion investigations, then he’d do it himself. The transcripts, many of them from nearly three years ago, were declassified and ready for public viewing since June.
As the grand impresario of collusion, Schiff has filled print and broadcast media since January 2017 claiming that he has seen “more than circumstantial evidence” of a Trump-Putin conspiracy. Obviously..."
"Newly released documents show he knew all along that there was no proof of Russia-Trump collusion.
Americans expect that politicians will lie, but sometimes the examples are so brazen that they deserve special notice. Newly released Congressional testimony shows that Adam Schiff spread falsehoods shamelessly about Russia and Donald Trump for three years even as his own committee gathered contrary evidence.
The House Intelligence Committee last week released 57 transcripts of interviews it conducted in its investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The committee probe started in January..."
"A newly declassified U.S. intel report on the origins of the novel coronavirus reveals that one intelligence agency has assessed with moderate confidence that the virus emerged from a lab-leak, while four others assessed with low confidence that COVID-19 originated from natural exposure to an infected animal.
The report says that the intelligence community “remains divided on the most likely origin of COVID-19” and that “all agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident.”"
"President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed Sunday to extend economic sanctions against Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine, amid signs that the president was trying to repair relations with his German host.
The two leaders met in Bavaria before the annual summit of leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. The White House said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Merkel agreed that sanctions “should be clearly linked to Russia’s full implementation” of a Ukrainian peace accord and Russian respect for its neighbor’s sovereignty.
European leaders will meet..."
"The top House Republican said Tuesday he won’t support creating a commission to investigate a pro-Trump mob’s attack on the U.S. Capitol in January, blaming Democrats for dithering and politicking and saying he doesn’t want to hurt ongoing criminal cases.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s opposition undercuts some in his own party, including Rep. John Katko, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee who had struck an agreement on the commission. Mr. Katko had won concessions from Democrats, including making the panel evenly bipartisan.
But Mr. McCarthy offered a host of..."
"Republicans are getting very optimistic about new trends emerging in early voting results in key states, which mostly shows Democrats casting more early ballots but not at the pace that Obama set in his victory in 2008 over Republican John McCain by 7 percentage points.

"President Joe Biden's ""60 Minutes"" declaration ""the pandemic is over"" is drawing a response Monday, but not quite a joyous one.
""The pandemic is over,"" Biden said Sunday. ""We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lot of work on it, but the pandemic is over.""
Health experts are saying the pandemic is not actually over yet, while Republicans are saying Biden and Democrats need to move to unwind their strict COVID-19 public policies and protocols then, if it indeed was over.
""With the pandemic officially over,..."
"A bipartisan group of ten senators has agreed to come to the negotiating table to attempt to pass legislation aimed at curbing gun violence in the United States after a series of recent mass shootings shocked the nation.
On Tuesday, an 18-year-old gunman entered an elementary school fourth-grade classroom in Uvalde, Texas and opened fire with a legally purchased AR-15, killing 19 children and 2 teachers. The shooter was later killed in an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement. A little over a week prior, a gunman stormed a supermarket in a black neighborhood in Buffalo,..."
"President Donald Trump isn't taking ""no tanks"" for an answer on the Fourth of July.
He said Monday that a display of U.S. military tanks will be part of a special event he's headlining July 4 in Washington, D. C., and photographers have spotted at least two M1A1 Abrams tanks and two Bradley Fighting Vehicles on flatcars in a railyard at the southeastern edge of Washington.
Military police were guarding the vehicles, which were visible to passers-by on nearby paths.
A U.S. official told the AP that the military vehicles..."
"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a new pandemic low last week as the job market continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
Figures released Thursday by the Labor Department show that applications for the week ended Nov. 13 fell to 268,000 from a revised 269,000 a week earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had projected the number of first-time filings to decline to 260,000.

The strain makes vaccines at least 40 per cent less effective against transmission than they are against Delta, according to experts, but scientists believe jabs still prevent it causing severe disease and hospitalisations. 
Britain, the US and EU all banned flights from southern Africa coming into their countries yesterday after the discovery of the strain, which originated in the region.

"A large faction of House liberals is threatening to derail President Joe Biden’s economic agenda by voting against a critical infrastructure bill Democrats hope to pass this week.
More than half of the 95-member House Progressive Caucus will vote against the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that Speaker Nancy Pelosi planned to bring up for a vote later this week. The group is insisting that the House and Senate first pass a $3.5 trillion social welfare spending bill that is not yet written and lacks full support among Democrats."
"We no longer have to transport ourselves to a magical alternate reality to ponder what a love child between Richard Nixon and Dick Cheney would look like. Given a Justice Department memo obtained by NBC News, we can conclude that child would look like none other than President Barack Obama.

"The Wuhan virus is spreading fear around the globe thanks to a Trump deranged and irresponsible media. This isn’t some superbug, folks. The seasonal flu is still deadlier. Now, that’s not to say you shouldn’t wash your hands regularly or take any of the precautions recommended by health officials that greatly reduce the chance of you getting sick. Regardless, those most at risk are the usual suspects: the elderly and the immunocompromised. A large chunk of the deaths in the U.S. from the WuFlu, which is extremely low compared to..."
"On Wednesday, an email emerged from White House in which national security aide Ben Rhodes instructed UN Ambassador Susan Rice – copying President Obama’s entire political team at the White House – that her goal on the Sunday shows following the September 11, 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi should be to “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.”"
"The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that Democrats can pass two more pieces of legislation via budget reconciliation procedures, bypassing a potential filibuster by Republicans.
The ruling allows Democrats to pass two bills with a simple majority instead of the usual 60-vote threshold required in the Senate. Democrats plan to use the budget reconciliation process to approve the Biden administration’s infrastructure plan, which is split into two bills. The process was previously used to pass Democrats’ coronavirus relief bill. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) announced the..."

"Social Security benefits are set to rise by 8.7% in 2023, the biggest bump in four decades as stubbornly high inflation erodes the buying power of retired Americans, the Social Security Administration said Thursday. 
The increase, known as a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), is the biggest since 1981, when recipients saw an 11.2% jump. It will increase the average monthly benefit by about $140. 
More than 64 million Americans collecting Social Security will receive the bigger payments beginning in January, the administration said.

As Kemp was delivering remarks shortly after signing the bill, he..."

The talks also undermined Egypt’s cease-fire proposal, which Israel had accepted and Hamas rejected (and would have prevented the vast..."
"A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that President Trump’s accounting firm must turn over his personal financial records including eight years of tax returns to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.
The court, though, is keeping the subpoena seeking the records at bay, for now, so the president can appeal its decision to the Supreme Court.
The dispute arose in 2018 after District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. began a criminal probe into the Trump Organization and its business dealings in New York.

The enduring quietude of Lent suddenly breaks, the somber music gives way to “All Glory, Laud, and Honor,” and we, the agents of Christ’s crucifixion, jubilantly welcome him to the city where he is soon to die, actors caught up in a drama whose ending has already been dictated by history and our own innate sinfulness."

Defending gay rights around the world, as he has done at home, Obama said a bill that President Yoweri Museveni has pledged to sign will mark a ""step backward"" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to protect the human rights of its people.

"Donald Trump has long claimed that investigations of him are a partisan “witch hunt.” Manhattan DA Cy Vance seems determined to make Trump’s point for him by indicting the Trump Organization along with its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.
The 15-count indictment throws a kitchen sink of charges, including grand larceny, conspiracy, scheme to defraud,and tax fraud. But the whole thing comes down to paying perks to Weisselberg — such as his parking garage fees, tuition for family members and reimbursement of holiday gratuities — and not reporting them as taxable income, or reporting..."

"George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis has revived the Obama-era narrative that law enforcement is endemically racist. On Friday, Barack Obama tweeted that for millions of black Americans, being treated differently by the criminal justice system on account of race is “tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal.’ ” Mr. Obama called on the police and the public to create a “new normal,” in which bigotry no longer “infects our institutions and our hearts.”
Joe Biden released a video the same day in which he asserted that all African-Americans fear for their safety from..."

"The Supreme Court ruled Thursday to limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s powers to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, dealing a blow to President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.
In a 6–3 ruling along ideological lines, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court sided with conservative states and fossil-fuel companies, adopting a narrow reading of the Clean Air Act.

In 2014 Slate ran a multi-part series about how liberals’ “embrace of busing hurt the cause of integration.” (“Many black Americans did believe in the school bus and the access it provided, and busing might have been a viable tool for those families had it been smartly and surgically applied. It wasn’t. It was presented in a sweeping fashion that denied many blacks the agency they sought.”) The next year, responding to an earlier iteration..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell faced a conservative backlash Wednesday after backing off demands that Congress reverse President Obama’s immigration executive actions as a condition for funding the Department of Homeland Security.
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, voiced support for the new plan after initially staying coy. A day earlier, McConnell, R-Ky., effectively gave them what they wanted – by agreeing to hold a stand-alone vote on a DHS funding bill, with no immigration measures attached.
“We are going to do everything we can to make sure it passes by an overwhelming..."

The bill was modified before its final passage after an agreement was reached between..."
"The acrimony surrounding former White House adviser Steve Bannon's very public break with President Donald Trump has escalated, suggesting a permanent split between the president and the pugilistic strategist who helped put him in the Oval Office.

The eight-year initiative, dubbed the American Jobs Plan, comes on the heels of Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. The White House said it will pay for the latest package by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% — rolling back part of former President Donald Trump's 2017..."

Economists had expected the economy to add 75,000 jobs, with forecasts ranging between 55,000 and 155,000, according to Econoday. That unusually wide range was caused, in part, by differing views of how the General Motors strike would hit employment at suppliers and related businesses.
Unemployment was expected to tick up to 3.6 percent."

As everyone knows, Bill Barr released a brief letter summarizing the top-line conclusions of the Mueller report shortly after he received it. Justice Department lawyers then worked with Mueller staff to make the appropriate redactions, after which the entire 400-page report was publicly released.

“I love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August. Unfortunately, Democrat Governor, @RoyCooperNC is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena,”..."
"A top Environmental Protection Agency official who had led the agency’s weakening of Obama-era climate change rules is resigning.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced Wednesday the departure of Assistant Administrator Bill Wehrum, the chief of the agency’s Office of Air and Radiation. Wehrum had been facing scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups for his past ties to the industry, considering his role in drafting business-friendly regulations."
"Andrew Yang, freshly off the campaign trail, is joining CNN as a commentator.
Apparently, that’s what Yang needed to do to get any speaking time on the network. In the July debate hosted by CNN, Yang spoke for a little less than nine minutes, while Joe Biden spoke for more than 21 minutes, Kamala Harris spoke for 17 minutes, and Cory Booker spoke for 13 minutes. Then, in the October debate on CNN, Yang spoke for about eight and a half minutes, while Warren spoke for almost 23 minutes, Biden..."

"Family members of the US Marines killed in last week’s suicide terror attack at the Kabul airport are slamming President Biden for his behavior at the dignified transfer ceremony over the weekend — with one Gold Star father accusing the commander-in-chief of doing “the most disrespectful thing I’ve ever seen” by repeatedly looking at his watch during the ceremony.
Darin Hoover, the father of Marine Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Biden checked his watch every single time a flag-draped coffin was removed from the hold of the Air Force C-17..."
"The family of a Marine who died in the Aug. 26 terror bombing in Kabul is blaming the Biden administration for the attack.
President Joe Biden met with the family of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum on Sunday, The Washington Post reported. The length of the meeting, only a few minutes, showed a “total disregard to the loss of our Marine,” McCollum’s sister Roice said.
Rylee McCollum, a 20-year old from Wyoming, was one of 13 American soldiers killed by an ISIS-K suicide bomber outside Hamid Karzai International Airport in..."
"The Senate will begin voting next week on a massive infrastructure and social spending package.
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the plan on the Senate floor Thursday. The New York Democrat said the Senate would vote on both a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure measure as well as a budget resolution calling for an additional $3.5 trillion on social spending programs.
“The time has come to make progress,” Schumer said.
Schumer’s announcement came one day after President Joe Biden urged Senate Democrats in a private lunch to back both bills."

"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the face of the White House coronavirus task force, testified Tuesday before the Senate Health Committee on efforts to combat the coronavirus, amid warnings that lifting restrictions keeping people home from school and work could pose unnecessary health risks.
The hearing, which features Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), as well as three other top administration health officials, is the biggest congressional hearing since the coronavirus crisis began. Fauci did not rip on the Trump administration's response to the pandemic..."
"The Biden administration said the fast-moving BA.5 variant of the coronavirus is a stark but manageable challenge, unveiling a plan that relies on frequent testing, antiviral drugs and up-to-date vaccinations while stopping short of an immediate expansion of the booster campaign as drugmakers reformulate their shots.
The new variant and a related one, BA.4, have become dominant in the U.S. and appear to transmit faster than previous forms of the virus and evade prior immunity — even as polling and general behavior suggest Americans would quit worrying about the pandemic...."
"Mexico apprehended about 1,000 migrants after President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on the country over its lax border policies.
About 200 Mexican military police intercepted the caravan walking north along a highway in southern Mexico on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The migrants told officers they planned to travel to the U.S. and claim asylum.
Some migrants resisted and others fled into the forest on either side of the highway, but the vast majority of those in the caravan complied with orders from Mexican officials. Hundreds of migrants..."

"The Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran’s international airport Wednesday was shot down by mistake by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, Pentagon officials told Fox News.
Officials said U.S. intelligence increasingly points at the airliner being accidentally struck by a Russian-made missile, killing all 176 people on board the flight, just hours after Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles targeting two military bases housing American and coalition troops."
"It felt like a gut punch.
That's how South Dakota small business owner Laurie Cox described how she felt when news broke that Canadian developer TC Energy officially pulled the plug on the Keystone XL pipeline.

The decision to call it quits left people like Cox, who owns a two-story hotel that housed pipeline workers in Midland, South Dakota, feeling..."
"President Trump prodded staffers for details about US military aid to Ukraine five weeks before his July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, a heavily redacted batch of internal administration documents reveal.
Emails sent between officials at the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget show that the hold on the aid was placed just hours after the two leaders spoke."
"Prepare to be disappointed.
That should be Democrats' mindset heading into Robert Mueller’s appearance this week before two House committees. The greater the anticipation of the testimony, the more the letdown is apt to be.
That is because the special counsel simply is not going to give them what they crave."
"Senate Democrats passed their massive spending package on Sunday in a party-line vote using budget reconciliation.
The so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” passed the Senate via a simple majority with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. Democrats used the budget reconciliation process, which allows a measure to pass with a simple majority rather than needing to meet a 60-vote threshold.
The legislation is essentially a pared down version of President Biden’s Build Back Better package that was put to rest last year when Senator Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) pulled..."

"Republicans, feeling increasingly confident the Senate will not vote to call new witnesses in the president’s impeachment trial, began plotting a path to acquittal perhaps as early as Friday.
“It does look to me like we are headed toward ending this week sometime,” Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican and a member of the GOP leadership team, said Thursday.
The second phase of the trial was set to conclude Thursday night when lawmakers finished 16 hours of questioning the House impeachment managers and Trump’s defense team.

"President Donald Trump said Thursday that the U.S. Navy has destroyed a drone controlled by Iran, calling the unmanned vehicle's approach of an American ship a 'provocative and hostile' act.
The conflict came in the Strait of Hormuz, the only shipping lane between the Persian Gulf and the open ocean. About one-fifth of the world's oil passes through it.
Trump said at the White House that the USS Boxer, a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship, 'took defensive action' after the drone strayed to within 1,000 yards.

I've already spoken on, I'm not a fan of court packing, but I don't want to get..."
"Donald Trump mostly brushed off the furor over Ted Cruz’s non-endorsement speech Wednesday night, calling the snub “no big deal” even as the senator himself doubled down – though the Republican standard-bearer used the dispute to warn voters that if Democrats win in November, their justices “will destroy us all.”"
"President Biden said it “remains to be determined” whether the police officer who fatally shot Daunte Wright, a black man, during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb on Sunday did so on accident.
Biden’s comments on Monday came after Police Chief Tim Gannon of the Brooklyn Center Police Department described the shooting as “an accidental discharge.” Gannon said the officer had intended to discharge a taser and instead fired a single shot at the man."
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is absolutely right to say the deaths of at least 51 migrants in a tractor-trailer in San Antonio “are on Biden” and to call the president’s border policies “deadly.”
Those migrants died because the traffickers they entrusted with their lives abandoned them in the baking heat and left them to suffocate. Those traffickers depend on a porous border and Biden’s overt gestures of welcome for their customer base. "
"For most U.S. congregations, in-person worship has returned to mid-March levels despite a nationwide rise in coronavirus cases, a new report says.
A study from LifeWay Research, a publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, found 71% of churches led by mainline Protestant or evangelical ministers met for in-person worship as recently as July 19.
On March 15, 95% of U.S. churches were meeting in-person as the coronavirus seeped its way into the Pacific Northwest and New York City."
"President Biden has unveiled another $1.8 trillion government-spending package ahead of tonight’s joint session speech to Congress, bringing the total spending signed or proposed in his first 100 days to about $6 trillion.
Let’s see how we got here.
When Biden took office, he pushed a massive spending package as “COVID relief” even though only about 5 percent of the spending was directly related to fighting the pandemic. That cost $1.9 trillion.
Once that passed, he proposed another bill, pitched as infrastructure legislation, which was mostly made up of provisions..."
"Voters handed control of the Senate to Republicans for the first time in eight years on Tuesday, putting the GOP in charge of Congress for the remainder of President Obama's term.
Republicans swept to victory in a string of contests across the country, retaining every one of the GOP-held seats up for grabs and picking up more than the six seats needed to take control of the Senate. Republicans enjoyed a banner night after mounting campaigns from coast to coast that, almost without exception, sought to cast their opponents..."
"Israeli officials said that researchers have not found any severe COVID-19 cases among vaccinated people infected with the Omicron variant.
The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus strain—which was named Omicron by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week—has prompted fresh global panic as a number of countries imposed travel restrictions on southern African countries, where the variant was first located.
Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, Israel’s head of public health services, noted that the Omicron infection chance is “very high,” but he said that vaccinated people who have been infected with the variant only became..."

"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said that rich countries need to switch from real beef to synthetic, plant-based alternatives as a way to combat climate change.
“I do think all rich countries should move to 100% synthetic beef. You can get used to the taste difference, and the claim is they’re going to make it taste even better over time,” Gates said during an interview with MIT Technology Review. “Eventually, that green premium is modest enough that you can sort of change the [behavior of] people or use regulation to totally..."
"An Omaha bar owner, who was a two-tour veteran and had been cleared by Douglas County District Attorney Don Kleine of charges after fatally shooting a rioter outside of his bar in May, was found dead by suicide on Sunday night, less than a week after a grand jury indicted him.

"For the second time in less than two months, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh joined with Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court’s three progressives (Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) to uphold a state vaccine mandate over a religious-liberty challenge by medical professionals.
This time, it was New York’s vaccine mandate, which initially included an exemption for religious objectors. These objectors included some Catholics and other Christians who oppose abortion. The vaccines are derived in part from abortion — specifically, from fetal-cell lines used in..."
"As the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention blames a ""protocol breach"" for the infection of a Dallas nurse with Ebola, questions are being raised over whether the CDC is capable of providing the adequate training for hundreds of thousands of health care workers -- who are at the front-lines of the fight against Ebola in America."
"The Supreme Court announced Monday it will take up two key cases involving President Trump’s get-tough immigration policy, granting hearings on his border wall construction project and his crackdown on bogus asylum claims.
The asylum policy, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols and more commonly called the “Remain in Mexico” policy, makes people who show up at the border from Central America and further afield return to Mexico to wait while their cases proceed in the U.S.
That eliminated the incentive to make bogus asylum claims, because it denied..."
"Recent admissions from an insider about former President Donald Trump’s challenge to last year’s election results should impel lawmakers of both parties to revise the convoluted Electoral Count Act that governed the proceedings.
Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, wrote in a memoir that he and Trump strategist Steve Bannon had a plan to halt Congress’s certification of election results last Jan. 6 — a plan that actually was hurt, he said, not helped, by the riot that engulfed the U.S. Capitol. The idea was to exploit loopholes in the Electoral Count..."
"The Food and Drug Administration backed Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose coronavirus vaccine as safe and effective on Wednesday as the agency weighs whether to clear the shot for emergency use.
FDA staff affirmed J&J’s finding that the vaccine was 66 percent effective overall at warding off moderate and severe COVID-19 cases and 85 percent effective at preventing the most serious infections.
While not as strong as Pfizer and Moderna’s two-dose vaccines, that efficacy rate could still make J&J’s shot a helpful weapon in the battle against the pandemic. It’s also..."
"Citigroup economists have forecast the chance of a global recession nearing 50 percent as central banks hike interest rates and consumer demand for goods drops off.
“The experience of history indicates that disinflation often carries meaningful costs for growth and we see the aggregate probability of recession as now approaching 50 percent,” economists led by Nathan Sheets said in a report on Wednesday.
“Central banks may yet engineer the soft—or ‘softish’—landings embodied in their forecasts (and in ours), but this will require supply shocks to ebb and demand to remain resilient.”
According to the report, Citigroup..."

Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told Israel’s Army Radio the report was “not correct, not accurate.”

"Congress has a public approval rating of 22%, which makes us wonder what the 22% are watching. It can’t be C-SPAN. If they paid attention to this week’s spectacle involving Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, the 22% are likely to join the other 78%.
Mr. Gosar, a Republican, illustrates the decline of Congress in profile. He tweeted an anime video of the Congressman attacking a character with the face of Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging a sword at a character with President Biden’s face.
Mr. Gosar has since deleted the..."

Standing just feet behind them was an innocent-looking masked man wearing military-style pants and with a bag slung around his back.

"Earlier today, Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that President Trump will sign the compromise government funding bill and “will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.” These are ominous words, indicating that the president is prepared to defy Congress and the plain language of the relevant statutes in a blatant abuse of power. Moreover, because he’s apparently set to invoke “national security,” the stakes are particularly high. Here’s why."
"Social media giant denies ‘systematic’ discrimination. Facebook announced Monday it was sending employees out for retraining and would discontinue some of its practices as it sought to defend itself against charges of political bias against conservatives.

The White House published a 58-page “economic blueprint” in September touting the fastest job recovery in 40 years, the creation of 3.7 million jobs and the unemployment rate standing at a near-50-year low of 3.7%. The report noted that this recovery has significantly outperformed the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections released shortly after President Joe Biden took office. The CBO estimated in Feb. 2021 that the economy would..."
"President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order banning any transactions with ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the video-sharing app TikTok, starting in 45 days.

"New Jersey Democratic governor Phil Murphy is ending his state's school mask mandates, signaling that some Democratic officials are ready to move away from politically fraught coronavirus restrictions.
Murphy announced on Sunday he would scrap the mask mandates on Monday afternoon, though the policy won't take effect until March, the New York Times first reported. As vice chairman of the National Governors Association, his decision will likely influence other state governors. Some have already made the move. Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf (D.) ended his state's school mask mandate in January, even as coronavirus case..."
"White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is considering recommending masks for vaccinated individuals as the Delta variant continues to surge.
Fauci spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union” about COVID-19 and was asked about one projection that suggests cases will continue rising if more Americans don’t get vaccinated. Fauci confirmed that “it’s not going to be good” and declared the country is “going in the wrong direction.” He also warned that the CDC is discussing mask mandates for people..."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence on Monday endorsed Karrin Taylor Robson, who is running against Trump-backed, former TV news anchor Kari Lake in the GOP primary for Arizona governor.
The endorsement further escalated the public rift between Mr. Pence and his former boss, teeing up another high-profile intraparty showdown ahead of the Aug. 2 primary.
Ms. Robson, a real estate developer and former member of the Arizona Board of Regents, is “the best choice for Arizona’s future” who will “keep Arizona’s border secure and streets safe, empower parents and create great schools, and promote conservative values,” Mr. Pence said.
“I..."
"The Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, used Swiss and other hidden bank accounts to transfer around $1 billion from the company to themselves, the New York attorney general’s office claimed Friday.
The family stands to lose billions after a litany of lawsuits claiming that their company marketed the painkiller OxyContin as nonaddictive despite knowing otherwise.
The transfers support allegations by New York and other states that the Sacklers have worked to shield their wealth in the face of mounting legal threats.
Those transfers include $20 million from a Purdue..."
"The U.S. Oil & Gas Association took a hit at President Biden after he tweeted on Saturday that ""companies running gas stations"" should simply ""bring down the price you are charging at the pump,"" telling him that he should ""please make sure the WH intern who posted this tweet registers for Econ 101 for the fall semester.""

"While the Air Force called a crew's stay at President Trump's Scotland resort earlier this year ""not unusual,"" it has ordered a review of its process for choosing overnight accommodations following ethics concerns.
Since April, the House Oversight Committee has been investigating the joint Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard unit's stop at Trump's Turnberry resort in Scotland while on a trip to Kuwait. On Sunday, an Air Force official insisted that all guidelines for selecting accommodations were properly followed, even providing evidence that Trump's resort offered lower room..."
"WASHINGTON — Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a stinging rebuke of the Senate’s $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package on Wednesday, saying the hard-hit Empire State had been shortchanged.
“It would be really terrible for the state of New York,” Cuomo said at his daily press conference, claiming New York State would receive just under $4 billion in funding from the huge package.
Cuomo said the figure was a paltry sum compared to the estimated $15 billion in lost revenue New York budget officials estimate will hit the state budget."
"By most conventional measures, President Biden should be riding pretty high.
He is about to score his first major legislative victory, pumping nearly $2 trillion—a staggering figure—into the economy to deal with the pandemic. A new ABC poll shows 68 percent of those surveyed approving of his approach to the crisis, a figure that includes 35 percent of Republicans. And he says every American will be able to get a vaccination by the end of May.
Yes, but: The Senate and House passed the giant packages without a single Republican..."
"Throughout 2021, the mainstream media has been caught or forced to correct multiple stories that turned out to be misleading or not true. From debunked stories such as the Steele dossier to new concerns over inflation, mainstream outlets badly reported on some of the biggest news stories of the year. 
Here are the top 10 most outrageous examples of the mainstream media reporting false or misleading stories this year. 
In April, videos emerged of a police officer shooting a Black teenager named Ma’Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio, after Bryant lunged at another..."
"The Libertarian Party presidential ticket of former Republican governors Gary Johnson (N.M.) and William Weld (Mass.) succeeded in seeming human, humane, decent, calm, and at least compared to their major party competitors, thoughtful this evening at their second CNN Town Hall.
But I'm not sure they succeeded in seeming very Libertarian, or selling the Party's position as a distinct outlook on politics and government that someone could grasp and understand.
They often seemed to go out of their way to just seem like a centrist, independent mixture of what someone..."
"Former President Donald Trump warned critical race theory is ""flagrant racism"" being forced into ""every facet of our society"" during a speech to conservatives Saturday night in Phoenix.
Trump spoke at Arizona Federal Theatre for the ""Protect Our Elections Rally"" hosted by Turning Point Action, TPUSA's political action committee, where he slammed Democrats for adhering to an ""America last"" ideology.
""We shouldn’t be apologizing to the world,"" he said. ""We’re apologizing for America, just like Obama apologized. Remember, he apologized. They should be apologizing to America for what they’ve done to it. That’s who I think should be apologizing to.

"Russian rockets and artillery strikes hit areas across a river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, officials said Sunday, heightening fears of radiation leaks and possible catastrophe.
Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, was captured by Moscow soon after the war began six months ago. Russia also holds adjacent territory along the left bank of the wide Dnieper River, while Ukraine maintains control of the right bank, including two cities, Nikopol and Marhanets, which are each about six miles from the plant.
Periodic blasts have damaged the power..."
"President Donald Trump on Nov. 12 issued an executive order to stop investments in Chinese companies that are tied to China’s military, citing threats to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
The order came in response to rising concerns over pension and retirement fund flows into foreign companies that support China’s totalitarian regime. It targets China’s military companies, including those designated by the Pentagon in June and August of 2020.
Beijing “is increasingly exploiting United States capital to resource and to enable the development and..."
"As soon as Democrat Joe Biden announced he would nominate South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, media outlets rushed to hail the choice as a historic occasion for LGBT individuals.
Numerous outlets, including Sky News, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, reported that Buttigieg would be the first “openly gay man” to hold a Cabinet post. Except, Buttigieg would not be the first “openly gay” cabinet member, as that honor already belongs to Richard Grenell, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in February to serve as the acting..."
"The acting head of the Transportation Security Administration was reassigned late Monday after a watchdog report revealed undercover agents were able to sneak fake explosives and banned weapons through checkpoints as part of an investigation that revealed a massive, system-wide security failure at America's airports."
"Texans are all too familiar with her story. State Senator Wendy Davis overcame hardship as a divorced teenage mother living in a trailer before eventually getting accepted into Harvard Law school and scoring political victories - at least, according to her campaign team. She and her staff have used this narrative to fundraise in the Texas governor’s race and media outlets like the T"
"Ukrainian authorities warned of possible Russian provocations at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after workers there were reportedly told not to come to work on Friday.
Russian nuclear authorities told employees at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to stay home Friday, a Ukrainian intelligence official told NBC News.
The order has sparked concern that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have plans for a so-called false flag operation, as the war enters its sixth month.
“There is new information, it arrived about half an hour ago, that for tomorrow, August 19, there is..."
"At least half the U.S. workforce is psychologically detached from work and putting in the bare minimum at their jobs, a recent poll found.
Employee engagement has dropped steeply since 2020 and is the lowest it’s been in nearly a decade, with only 32% of employees reporting being engaged at their jobs and 18% actively disengaged, the Gallup poll found. The findings align with the online trend of “quiet quitting,” or putting in the bare minimum at work rather than going above and beyond."
"A federal judge on Monday blocked part of a recently signed Texas law that requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.
District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote Monday that the provision violates the rights of abortion doctors to do what they think is best for their patients and would unreasonably restrict a woman's access to abortion clinics.
Attorney General Greg Abbott filed an emergency appeal of Yeakel's order to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans."
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Friday that he is intends to sign an executive order that will prevent Florida schools from requiring students to mask.
DeSantis, who is a consistently vocal opponent of mask mandates, made the announcement from Cape Coral restaurant Two Meatballs in the Kitchen.
""I want to empower parents to make the best decisions they can for the well being of their children,"" DeSantis said, referring to the fact that he plans to leave the decision on whether children should wear masks or not up to..."
"The Department of Homeland Security released a new regulation on Monday that would severely limit the number of impoverished migrants eligible to enter and remain in the U.S. legally by requiring that visa applicants not be reliant on public services.
Under the expanded public-charge rule, which was added to the Federal Register on Monday, the authorities will consider an immigrant’s use of non-cash government-assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, as a negative factor in determining their eligibility for a green card or temporary visa."
"President Biden has decided to adhere to his initial August 31 deadline for withdrawing American forces from Afghanistan.
“We are currently on a pace to finish [the withdrawal] by August 31,” Biden said in remarks at the White House. “The completion by August 31 depends upon the Taliban continuing to cooperate and allow access to the airport for those who we’re transporting out, and no disruptions to our operations.”"
"President Trump has nominated Herman Cain and Stephen Moore to the Federal Reserve board, choices that Nancy Pelosi called ""ill-suited,"" ""embarrassing,"" and ""the worst.""
Cain, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO, became synonymous with his famous tagline, ""9-9-9,"" when he was running for president in 2012. That is, a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent corporate tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. He told voters he'd implement the plan in his first 90 days as president.
Moore is an economics expert who served as an adviser to Trump's..."
"After 360 requests from Chris Wallace, President Obama finally agreed to appear on Fox News Sunday. The last time President Obama was on Fox News, it was Super Bowl 2014 and he was sitting down with Bill O'Reilly, the topics of discussion being Obamacare, Benghazi and the brewing IRS scandal. This time, the president met with Wallace to comment on his highly criticized foreign policy decisions and Hillary Clinton's email scandal. In regards to the latter, Obama insisted the FBI probe into his former secretary of state's private server would..."
"The economy gained 4.8 million jobs in June, lowering the unemployment rate to 11.1%, the Labor Department said Thursday.
June's job gains were a record and easily beat forecasters' expectations. Nevertheless, the jobs report is clouded by the fact that, even with the improvements, the labor market was in historially bad shape even before coronavirus outbreaks worsened throughout the South and West later in June.
“Looking beyond the June employment data, worrisome signs have emerged in recent days regarding a pullback in store traffic and spending likely linked to the..."
"American basketball star Brittney Griner’s weeks-long detainment in Moscow has been extended for another two months, Russian state media said Thursday.

Citing a Moscow court decision, state news agency TASS reported that Griner’s “period of detention” was being drawn out until at least May 19."
"Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns met in person with top Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar during a low-publicity rendezvous in Kabul on Monday.
Burns, a former diplomat and deputy secretary of state, traveled to the war-torn capital city of Kabul in Afghanistan for undisclosed negotiations with Baradar, according to reports first shared by the Washington Post. While the CIA has remained tight-lipped about the details of the meeting, Burns's position as CIA director and a former high-ranking member of the State Department makes him the highest-ranking U.S. official to meet with the..."
"Stung by criticism from within their own ranks, House Democrats rushed Tuesday to alter their border crisis spending bill, proposing new hurdles the Trump administration must clear as it tries to deal with the surge of illegal immigrants.
The biggest change would be putting a cap on how long Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) can be held at shelters that don’t go through a state licensing process.
That change could upend the way the government, dating back to the Obama years, has cared for the children who show up at the..."
"Two candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump won open Republican primary races for the House of Representatives in Ohio on Tuesday, capping a triumphant night for the former president and his camp.
Max Miller won the Republican primary in Ohio’s Seventh District, and Madison Gesiotto Gilbert will be the GOP nominee in the state’s Thirteenth District. Miller will likely have an easy path to Congress, as his district leans right by 14 points, according to FiveThirtyEight. Gesiotto Gilbert’s district is a toss-up, leaning Republican by only two points.
A former White House aide,..."
"Vaccine distribution is ramping up across the country and COVID infection rates are already dropping significantly.
The doctor leading the charge in the U.S. fight against the virus says things will only improve as more vaccines are available in the coming weeks.

"The Daily Caller contacted all 50 Senate Democrats repeatedly and asked if they would support President Joe Biden in his 2024 presidential bid. Five Senators said “Yes.”
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader and Democratic New York Sen. Chuck Schumer responded to the Daily Caller with a one-word answer: “Yes.”
Spokespeople for Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Jack Reed of Rhode Island responded in the same way: “Yes.”
Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s spokesperson also said the senator would endorse Biden, noting, “Yes, Senator Booker supports President..."
"Republicans are pouncing on President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, launching an ad blitz intended to convince voters the plan is unfair to the working class.
The American Action Network, a conservative organization, will air ads nationwide for the next 10 days featuring actors who portray everyday workers talking about how they have worked extra shifts just to help others get out of debt. The ads will air during college football and MLB games over the next week and a half.

"President Biden formally recognized the Armenian genocide on Saturday, in a statement coinciding with the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day observed in that country.
“Each year on this day, we remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring,” Biden said in a statement. “We honor their story. We see that pain. We affirm the history,” Biden added. “We do this not to cast blame but to ensure that what happened is never repeated.”
Biden..."
"It has to go through Pennsylvania, which is necessary but not sufficient.
He needs to take Pennsylvania, hold onto Georgia and North Carolina, then take either Arizona (for 279 electoral votes) or Nevada (for 274). Biden leads in both of those states. But Trump is gaining in Arizona, and it’s entirely conceivable that he could overtake Biden there (despite Fox and AP prematurely calling it for Biden).
The problem is Pennsylvania, where Trump has been losing ground fast, and Georgia, where he is hanging on by a thread. If he..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday will hear arguments in two cases challenging the Texas abortion law that bans most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy.
The court will hear arguments in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson and United States v. Texas, both of which challenge the Texas abortion law.
On Monday, the court will deliberate on concerns around the structure of the Texas law rather than consider whether the law violates Roe v. Wade.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the abortion ban into law in May. The law took effect in September and..."
"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won his legal battle against being extradited from the UK to face espionage charges — after a judge decided he would likely commit suicide if sent to the US.
District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that it would be “oppressive” to extradite the 49-year-old Australian because of his mental health as he faced up to 175 years in prison for allegedly hacking into US government computers.
She described Assange as “a depressed and sometimes despairing man” who had the “intellect and determination” to circumvent any..."
"The White House said on Tuesday that detained American tourist Jeffrey Fowle had been released from North Korea and was on his way home to be with his family.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States welcomed the move but pressed North Korea to release two other U.S. citizens as well.

"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) defended her support for the filibuster on Monday despite near-unified opposition from the rest of her party, taking the absolutist view that it should even be restored for judicial nominations.
Speaking at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, Sinema spoke out against Democratic efforts to scrap the rule, which requires 60 votes to move forward on most legislation.
""It'd be bad for us as Americans to think that we should always feed our short-term desires, rather than thinking about the long term,""..."
"As of early Wednesday morning, New York City mayoral candidate Eric Adams leads the Democratic primary contest by a comfortable ten-point margin, but remains short of outright victory thanks to the delays in ballot-counting caused by the city’s adoption of ranked-choice voting.
With 84 percent of ballots counted, Adams has secured 31.7 percent of the vote; Maya Wiley, former counsel to mayor Bill de Blasio, follows with 22.3 percent; former New York City Sanitation Department commissioner Kathryn Garcia has 19.5 percent. Businessman and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang became the..."
"The Washington game now requires that any unindicted politician with a bit of ambition — even 75-year-old Jerry Brown — let it be known that he is thinking about maybe, just possibly running for president.
But here’s the flip side: the media culture now demands to know whether these pols are quietly plotting a White House bid — and treats it as sort of strange if the answer is no.
What do you mean you’re not feverishly plotting a presidential bid three years before the next election? Is there something..."
"It seems we need to be reminded every two years or so why liberals cannot govern. They value their pious, self-aggrandizing ideology over the reality of governing.
The hypocrisy of the left was laid bare when Florida Governor DeSantis sent 50 Venezuelan immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard. “Not in My Back Vineyard!” they said. Liberals love to impose their woke values on others as long as they do not have to labor under them personally. But send just 50 Hispanics to Martha’s Vineyard. Michelle Obama and her limousine liberal, trust fund friends on that leafy..."
"Any delay into the criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump and the records he kept at Mar-a-Lago could put America's national security at risk, according to the Justice Department.
The DOJ made the claim in the wake of U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge, granting the former president’s request for a special master to review evidence seized during the raid independently.
The DOJ claimed that pausing the FBI’s criminal investigation while separately continuing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s damage assessment was essentially impossible...."
"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer moved Monday for a floor vote later this week on bipartisan legislation to codify the Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage rights into law following a months-long impasse.
The New York Democrat teed up a procedural vote for Wednesday that will require 60 votes to advance to final passage as early as this week.
The bill is expected to clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold after a bipartisan group spearheading the legislation announced they had an agreement on protecting nonprofit religious groups that oppose performing..."

"U.S. job growth moderated in August from a torrid pace the previous month, but hiring remained solid despite growing headwinds from higher interest rates, scorching-hot inflation and mounting recession fears.
Employers added 315,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, in line with the 300,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, unexpectedly ticked up to a six-month high of 3.7% as the labor force participation rate increased.  
Job gains were broad-based in August, with professional and business services leading the..."
"Rhetorical fireworks ensued yet again on Tuesday when Sen. Rand Paul faced off with Dr. Anthony Fauci over the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Kentucky Republican, who has sparred with the infectious disease expert numerous times at Senate hearings, used the latest discussion to examine the extent of U.S. involvement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
“To arrive at the truth, the U.S. government should admit that the Wuhan Virology Institute was experimenting to enhance the coronavirus’s ability to infect humans,” Mr. Paul said.
The senator urged more transparency pertaining to the..."
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Thursday over his growing blackface scandal but stopped short of saying whether there were more pictures or videos of him dressed up in darkened makeup.
""I am wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,"" he said during a news conference in Winnipeg. ""And, the question is, how can you not remember that? The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.""

According to a declassified CIA inspector general's report, CIA officers improperly accessed Senate computers, read the emails of Senate staff, and exhibited a ""lack of candor"" when interviewed by agency investigators. The document, released Thursday by the CIA, is a summary of an internal CIA investigation -- which prompted CIA..."
"Former President Donald Trump dismissed the ex-White House aide who testified before the Jan. 6 committee on Tuesday as a leaker and a ‘phony’ whom he denied a job after his presidency ended. 
Mr. Trump said Cassidy Hutchinson, who served under former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, requested to join others from the president’s team in Florida after he left office, but he rejected her.
“Why did she want to go with us if she felt we were so terrible?” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I understand that she..."
"President Trump announced a 30-day travel ban from European countries Wednesday night to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to address the pandemic.
“The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,” Trump said. “As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.”
The restrictions, which will go into effect Friday at midnight, will not apply to the United Kingdom, and U.S. citizens and..."

"Election projections indicate that Emmanuel Macron has won the second round of the French presidential elections, despite a big drop in support.
Polling stations closed in France at 7 p.m. local time, and early projections indicate the globalist leader has taken a little over 57 per cent of the vote, compared to a little under 43 per cent for national populist challenger Marine Le Pen.

"The White House on Tuesday rejected House Speaker John Boehner's call for a fall-back option to avert the looming fiscal crisis, in a move the speaker's office said ""defies common sense.""
The feisty exchange came as both sides crept toward a possible middle ground in private talks. But underscoring the differences that remain, the White House resisted Boehner's bid to craft a ""Plan B"" just in case those talks fail to yield a compromise before a Jan. 1 deadline -- that's when taxes are set to rise on everyone,..."
"Within a matter of weeks, roughly half of the 50 states will likely ban or severely restrict abortion. We know this to be true because, for the half-century that Roe v. Wade reigned supreme, every Republican in a safely red state told us so.
Now, the Supreme Court has democratized the abortion question, returning the issue that remained in an effectively 50-50 deadlock for 50 years to the states as the Constitution intended.
The same people who brought us half a decade of apoplectic panic about Russia/Facebook/Republicans directly murdering American democracy are now in, well,..."
"President Obama’s new national-security strategy ranks combating climate change as a priority alongside more traditional threats such as terrorism, biological emergencies and nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue states.

Along with confronting terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and working to reverse automatic budget cuts for national defense, the administration cited climate change as a top priority.

Kelly, who would later become President Trump's White House chief of staff, had every reason to express devastation when he delivered a Veterans Day address to the Semper Fi Society of St. Louis in Missouri on Nov. 13, 2010. Kelly’s son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, had died four days earlier, killed by a buried improvised explosive device as he crossed an irrigation ditch in Afghanistan’s Sangin District, in restive Helmand Province.
A consummate warrior, Kelly did not succumb to his grief but rallied the..."

"For the first time in years, Apple's iPhones aren't the star of the show. Apple unveiled a smartwatch called the Apple Watch on Tuesday, a wearable device that marks the company's first major entry in a new product category since the iPad's debut in 2010.
The move is significant because of recent questions about whether Apple still has a knack for innovating following the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs.
The device's introduction upstaged the company's two new, larger iPhones, which won't just have bigger screens; they'll have a new,..."
"Minnesota Public Schools reached an agreement with its teachers' union to institute a policy that will discriminate against white teachers during layoffs, according to a report from Alpha News.
The agreement, which the union reached in March following a two-week strike, upends the seniority-based layoff system under which teachers who have been employed the least amount of time are the first to be fired.

""You ask him some questions, like, why do you think it's good to insult our military allies, why do you praise dictators?"" Weld told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Is it because you wish the United States was more dictatorial? I'm afraid that might be the case. Why are you so angry about everything..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) broke with the Republican National Committee Tuesday over its decision to censure GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for sitting on the House Select Committee tasked with investigating last year’s Capitol riot.
McConnell told reporters at the Capitol that he felt the RNC had no business “singling out members of our party who may have different views from the majority.
“That’s not the job of the RNC,” the Kentucky Republican added.
The censure resolution passed by voice vote at the RNC’s winter meeting in Salt..."
"China has declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal, a move that comes amid an intensifying crackdown by the Chinese government.
The People’s Bank of China said on Friday that the move was done to ensure national security and stability, but the decision comes after several other regulatory changes in recent months that China hopes will cut down on its competition with the digital tokens."
"The Obama administration faced a backlash from congressional Democrats on Friday following revelations that the National Security Agency broke privacy rules and overstepped its authority thousands of times since 2008.
The details were reported late Thursday in The Washington Post, based on an audit and other secret documents provided by NSA leaker Edward Snowden. The report challenged claims by President Obama just last week that the NSA was not abusing its authority, and complicated his effort to reassure Americans and Congress that -- with a little more oversight and..."
"Administration officials and lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday condemned the killing of Kayla Jean Mueller -- a 26-year-old American aid worker who had been held hostage by Islamic State militants -- calling it a “barbaric” act and “an unspeakably ugly insult to the civilized world.”
“ISIL, and ISIL alone, is the reason Kayla is gone,” Secretary of State John Kerry said in a written statement. “Like our friends in Jordan, our resolve is unshaken to defeat this vile and unspeakably ugly insult to the civilized world and to defeat..."
"Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of United States European Command, publicly contradicted President Joe Biden on Tuesday.
Biden sowed international confusion last week when he appeared to tell soldiers with the 82nd Airborne that they were headed to Ukraine.
""You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle in front of a damned tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground,’"" Biden said.
The White House was forced to clarify Biden's comments,..."
"President Trump never ordered his coronavirus task force to slow down testing for the pathogen, key members told Congress on Tuesday.
“None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
“It’s the opposite, we’re going to be doing more testing, not less,” Dr. Fauci said."
"President Donald Trump reacted to the news that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering updating the standards for a coronavirus vaccine.
“That sounds like a political move,” Trump said during the White House press briefing on Wednesday, noting that their updated guidance would only lengthen the time that a coronavirus vaccine could be released to the public."
"The number of workers claiming unemployment benefits increased by 3.2 million last week, according to the Labor Department.
Economists had expected 3.1 million new jobless claims.
The number of weekly jobless claims dropped in every state last week except Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, and New Mexico. The territory of Puerto Rico also saw an increase in jobless claims.
Thursday's number is roughly half of the historic 6.9 million claims made during the week ending March 28, but the number is still extremely high by historical standards. Prior to the coronavirus,..."
"Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, who served as President Trump's final campaign manager during the 2016 election that carried him to victory, announced Sunday evening that she'll be leaving her White House post at the end of this month.
Her conservative lawyer husband, George Conway, who is a frequent critic of the president, simultaneously announced on social media that he will be stepping back from his position at the Lincoln Project, an entity consisting of anti-Trump Republicans and independents.
Both said they want to focus on their family. The couple have..."
"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin offered a lump of coal to his fellow Democrats after he demanded $150 billion in clean-energy initiatives be removed from a budget bill currently making its way through the Senate.
Senate sources confirmed to The Post that Manchin was “dug in” on climate issues.
“As a path forward there are two choices, compromise in some form or fashion or eliminate the climate aspect from reconciliation and work on it thereafter,” said one senior insider in the chamber.
Manchin has already expressed cost reservations about the..."
"Republicans are ripping into Democrats and media outlets for what they allege is silence over the latest development in the sexual assault allegation against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden -- after video emerged that appears to show accuser Tara Reade’s mother referring to the alleged assault on TV in 1993.
“Joe Biden isn’t sheltering in place in his basement bunker because of the pandemic, he’s hiding from Tara Reade,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted Friday."

"Nearly every one in four American adults are not at all satisfied with the state of their nation’s K-12 public education, a new poll says.
The latest Gallup poll, released Sept. 1, reports that just 42 percent of respondents said they’re at least somewhat satisfied with the quality of education offered at K-12 public schools in the United States, marking the lowest reading since 2000 (36 percent).
At the same time, 23 percent of respondents said they are “completely dissatisfied,” and 32 percent are “somewhat dissatisfied.”
The sentiment is much more positive when..."
"Jurors in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday declared Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all counts, capping off an intense trial surrounding the deadly unrest in that city last summer. 
Rittenhouse, 18, would have faced a mandatory life sentence if found guilty and convicted of first-degree intentional homicide.
The verdict came on the fourth day of deliberations and 15th day of the trial.
Local officers, media and protesters were seen positioned around the Kenosha County Courthouse Friday.
Rittenhouse was facing charges of first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin Friday said that he will support Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court, as the nominee inches closer to confirmation. 
""After meeting with her, considering her record, and closely monitoring her testimony and questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, I have determined I intend to vote for her nomination to serve on the Supreme Court,"" Manchin, D-W.Va., said in a Friday statement. 
""Her wide array of experiences in varying sectors of our judicial system have provided Judge Jackson a unique perspective that will serve her well on our..."
"The White House confirmed Tuesday that President Biden will travel to Saudi Arabia next month, though the left was already criticizing the trip before it was formally announced. While his trip makes strategic and economic sense, it would be less embarrassing now if Mr. Biden had been more realistic about the world from day one.
Mr. Biden came into office bowing to the left’s disdain for Riyadh without appreciating the strategic need for Arab allies in the Gulf. As a candidate hevowedto make Saudi Arabia “pay the price and make them,..."
"Former Secretary of State Hilary R. Clinton was the only person empowered by law to authorize the occupation of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Libya before the deadly terror attacks there last year, because the buildings did not meet State Department security standards, a House hearing heard Wednesday.

"President Biden told leaders at the G-7 summit on Friday,the same day the U.S. reentered the Paris Agreement, that the days of “America First” diplomacy championed by former President Trump were over, according toThe New York Times.
As The New York Post, which cited Biden’s intent to declare on Friday that the “America First” era was over, noted, “Biden has swiftly dismantled Trump’s foreign policy agenda, which saw the U.S. withdraw from the World Health Organization, the Paris Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump believed were against the..."
"President Trump can catch a break at arena sporting events.
Some two dozen angry protesters armed with bright orange anti-Trump signs were stationed outside Madison Square Garden on Saturday night as President Trump arrived at the arena for UFC 244 — but there were twice as many fans happy to see the commander in chief.
Trump, who traveled with Reps. Kevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, and Mark Meadows, (R-NC), touched down at John F. Kennedy Airport at 8:05 p.m."
"Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is slashing his campaign budget with across-the-board pay cuts and other changes, overhauling an operation that started as a political juggernaut but now may need to stay lean to survive.
The one-time GOP front-runner has seen his political momentum undercut by outsider candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who now lead in most polls, relegating the former Florida governor to the middle of the pack.
In a bid to recalibrate its strategy and operations, the Bush campaign plans to cut its budget by..."
"Senate Democrats voted on Tuesday to proceed with impeachment, rejecting a Republican attempt to block their Trump trial. But even though they won the vote, it's actually good news for the former president.
That's because 45 senators just voted to declare the impeachment effort unconstitutional. In other words, there don't appear to be enough votes to actually impeach Trump when the trial begins the week of Feb. 8.
Democrats accuse former President Trump of “incitement of insurrection”. House Democrats quickly voted without holding any hearings to impeach Trump on a..."
"A quick-thinking, off-duty, Border Patrol officer, armed with his barber's shotgun, helped rescue dozens of children and his daughter during the nightmarish shooting at the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.
The New York Times reported that Jacob Albarado was getting his hair cut when his wife Trisha, who teaches fourth grade at Robb Elementary, sent him an urgent text message.
""There's an active shooter,"" she wrote. ""Help."" And she added: ""I love you.""
As he got ready to run out, his barber loaned him a shotgun. Albarado then sped off to the..."
"All of our lives have been drastically impacted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic — and we know all of us are eager to return to the way things were before the pandemic began. However, that simply won’t be possible without a safe, effective vaccine. Fortunately, due to the strength of American innovation and unprecedented public-private partnerships, a COVID-19 vaccine is on the horizon. We, as the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and a physician on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, have..."
"GOP Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul introduced a bill that would prevent police officers from forcibly entering homes without announcing their presence or purpose for entering.
On Thursday, Paul, a Republican, introduced the ""Justice for Breonna Taylor Act,"" a two-page long bill that would effectively ban no-knock warrants.
“After talking with Breonna Taylor’s family, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants. This bill will effectively end no-knock raids in the United States,” Paul said in a statement on Thursday.

"President Trump is expected to issue between 50 and 100 commutations and pardons before he leaves office this week, two sources familiar with the list told Fox News.
The sources told Fox News that the announcement of the pardons will likely come in one large batch on Tuesday, but there is a slight chance the White House will wait to make them official Wednesday morning. The president has until noon on Wednesday to do so."
"According to recent polls, 65% of all Americans now support Black Lives Matter (BLM). Why do so many Americans support an “organization” that is avowedly dedicated to the proposition that America is evil and must be fundamentally transformed? Because the Republican establishment has made remarkably little effort to expose BLM as the revolutionary and totalitarian movement that it is.
Leading Republicans do not seem to understand that George Floyd’s death was the excuse for the current crisis, not the cause of it. The chaos in our streets—led by BLM,..."
"On Monday, a mob attempted to knock down a statue of Andrew Jackson. They spray-painted the base, trying to knock the statue down. In large letters, you can see it says ""killer"" at the bottom. Amazing.
This is happening all over the country as you know and there's a reason for it. Over the weekend, most recently -- doubtless, you've heard of this -- city officials announced their plan to remove the statue of Teddy Roosevelt from outside New York's Museum of Natural History. The bronze statue has stood there..."
"In a surprise announcement that could derail a major trade deal, President Donald Trump says he is placing a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports, effective June 10, to pressure the country to do more to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border.
Trump said the percentage will gradually increase — up to 25% — ""until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied.""
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador quickly fired back in a letter to Trump saying that ""social problems are not..."
"President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when he reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean, a U.S. judge said in a ruling that restored the Obama-era restrictions.
U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in a decision late Friday threw out Trump’s executive order that overturned the bans that comprised a key part of Obama’s environmental legacy.
Presidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development but cannot revoke those removals, Gleason said."
"During an interview with radio host Charlamagne Tha God, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that if black voters don’t support him for president they aren’t really black.
The comment came after a staffer interrupted the conversation, trying to cut off the interview.
An irritated Biden then said, “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.""

"CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta admitted to podcast host Joe Rogan Wednesday that it was improper for the network to claim Rogan took ""horse dewormer"" as a COVID treatment. 
On Wednesday's installment of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" Rogan grilled the doctor on why someone like him who already had COVID and has antibodies should get vaccinated. 
""By the way, I'm glad you're better,"" Gupta said. 
""Thank you,"" Rogan responded. ""You're probably the only one at CNN who's glad … The rest of them are all lying about me taking horse medication."""
"The House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that would create a bipartisan, 9/11-style commission into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with dozens of Republicans joining Democrats in a rebuke of GOP leadership.
The bill passed 252 to 175 with support from 35 Republicans, even though top GOP leaders opposed it and launched a last-ditch effort to convince its members to vote against it. It was authored by Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and New York Republican Rep. John Katko, the top lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee, and..."
"Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser requested the deployment of the city’s National Guard troops to address the influx of migrants bused from Texas and Arizona.
“We’ve had a number of discussions, we’ve facilitated FEMA’s involvement with a million dollar grant that has now been increased to work with a lead nonprofit agency. We’ve facilitated using those grant funds to set up a respite center in a neighboring jurisdiction and I’ve also asked the Secretary of the Army to deploy the DC National Guard to help lead that effort,” Bowser said during a..."
"Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist for President Trump who is awaiting trial on charges of contempt of Congress, has agreed to cooperate with the January 6 committee.
Bannon wrote in an email to the panel, first obtained by the Guardian, that he was open to appearing for a public hearing after receiving a letter from Trump waiving his executive privilege. The email restated that Bannon had felt obligated to refuse the original congressional subpoena from the committee because Trump had claimed executive privilege over his testimony.
“When you first received the Subpoena to..."
"Inflation remained painfully high in May, with consumer prices hitting a new four-decade high that exacerbated a financial strain for millions of Americans and worsened a political crisis for President Biden.
The Labor Department said Friday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 8.6% in May from a year ago. Prices jumped 1% in the one-month period from April. Those figures were both higher than the 8.3% headline figure and 0.7% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists. ..."
"Pentagon press secretary John Kirby is making the rounds — and headlines — on Tuesday’s morning news shows.
On Fox News, Kirby explained away the equipment the U.S. military left in the hands of the Taliban by admitting that “while there’s certainly a lethality component to it, it doesn’t pose a threat to the United States, it doesn’t pose a threat to neighboring nations.” On Monday, America’s 20-year conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan ended when the last U.S. troops exited the country less than two weeks before the anniversary..."
"Twitter announced that it would label web links to Russian state media so users can identify reliable news sources.
The move to identify Russian propaganda arrives as misinformation regarding the Ukraine invasion has increased on social media and as Russia aims to censor several social media platforms within its borders.
""Today, we’re adding labels to Tweets that share links to Russian state-affiliated media websites and are taking steps to significantly reduce the circulation of this content on Twitter,"" tweeted Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, on Monday."
"Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Maine’s policy of allowing parents to use school vouchers for religious schools was not a violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the national government from establishing a state religion. In a rare moment of principle, Chief Justice John Roberts rightly asserted in the majority opinion that excluding religious schools from the voucher program was blatant religious discrimination.
This is significant for school choice. It illustrates just how feasible it is to implement school choice and how well it can work...."
"California’s smash-and-grab robbery nightmare is directly tied to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s continuing state of emergency declarations, according to the Orange County sheriff.
The California Judicial Council imposed a zero-bail system in response to Newsom’s March 2020 executive order that imposed a yearlong lockdown, which became the most stringent in the nation. A chain reaction ensued, pushed along by district attorneys in the two hardest-hit cities, San Francisco and Los Angeles, who have refused to file stiff charges. The prosecutors are emboldened by support from Newsom, the Legislature, and local politicians, critics say...."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order excluding illegal immigrants from being counted in the 2020 United States census.
Since the first census in the 1970s, both US citizens and non-citizens have been included in the country’s official population count, regardless of their immigration status, as part of a process which determines federal funding and how many seats each state gets in Congress.
But Trump’s order, which had been anticipated for weeks, is the latest salvo in his administration’s ongoing battle with the Census Bureau."
"While President Barack Obama claimed that he found out about Hillary Clinton's private email from news reports (Presidents: they're just like us!), White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today that the president and Clinton had indeed exchanged emails using Clinton's private address.
“The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,” Earnest said. “I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each..."

Fox News obtained a copy of the 17-page draft proposal on Monday, which contains guidelines for child care centers, schools, day camps, faith-based institutions, bars and restaurants and public transportation, and an outline of specific directions for each sector.
According to the Washington Post, which first obtained the draft guidelines, coronavirus task force..."
"The broken system can’t be fixed without border security. Most Americans agree that our immigration system is broken. Many agree that it desperately needs to be fixed. Many agree that past attempts to fix it have failed or even made our problems worse.
Each time we’ve tried to pass immigration reform, border security becomes a last priority, if it is even a priority at all. We always address how to handle undocumented workers already here without addressing how they arrived here in the first place."
"Apple’s insanely expensive new desktop computer will be made in the United States — not China, the company announced Monday.
The $6,000 Mac Pro will be built at Apple’s Austin, Texas, plant following US trade regulators approving 10 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple for computer parts.
“The new Mac Pro will include components designed, developed and manufactured by more than a dozen American companies for distribution to US customers,” Apple said in a statement.
The Mac Pro had been assembled at the Austin plant since 2013, but Apple..."
"Analysts tore into the mass media who hyped the potential danger of Saturday's rally in Washington, D.C., only to find that the actual attendees were outnumbered by the police and the press. 
The media frequently reported on the danger of the ""Justice for J6"" rally, suggesting it would be the sequel to the deadly Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill the day Congress intended to certify the results of the November 2020 election. A heavy law enforcement presence was put in place in hopes of preventing another violent scene. Authorities erected temporary fencing around the Capitol and..."

"Peter Navarro, President Donald Trump’s trade adviser, warned the administration in late January that the coronavirus outbreak could put millions of Americans at risk and wind up costing the United States trillions of dollars.
His grim assessment came in a Jan. 29 memo and is the highest level warning known to have circulated inside the White House, The New York Times reported.
“The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil,” Navarro’s memo..."
"President Trump has ousted another inspector general, the fourth IG in the last six weeks. This time, Steve Linick of the State Department was cashiered. The White House says the president has his reasons for no longer having “the fullest confidence” in IG Linick. Perhaps . . . but it is curious how these removals always seem to happen late on Fridays, when administrations do things they’d prefer you didn’t notice.
I am not a fan of the institution of inspector general because it is constitutionally suspect, to say the..."
"Four years ago, Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled off an upset in Michigan that gave life to his insurgent challenge to front-runner Hillary Clinton. On Tuesday, Sanders suffered a crushing defeat in the state, and whether he’s ready or not to acknowledge it, he is now without a realistic path to the Democratic nomination.
It’s incredible to think that just over two weeks ago, Sanders was the heavy favorite to be the Democratic nominee. With a massive win in Nevada coming off of a victory in New Hampshire and arguable win..."
"The White House is urging states and cities to speed up the deployment of federal aid to stave off evictions after a moratorium lapsed and Congress failed to extend it.
""State and local governments long ago received Emergency Rental Assistance— a $46.5 billion plan to protect millions of Americans facing deep rental debt and potential eviction during the pandemic,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Monday. ""Too many states and cities have been too slow to act.""
States have distributed only a fraction of the aid meant to support both..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is knocking President Donald Trump after Tuesday night’s presidential debate in Ohio.
The House speaker, during an MSNBC interview on Wednesday, called the first presidential debate a “sad night for our country” and blasted Trump for not disassociating himself from white supremacist and militia groups, as she put it.
“I lost a lot of sleep last night over that one fact,” Pelosi said.
She continued to declare that Trump has “never respected the dignity of his office and he demonstrated that last night.”"
"Islamic State said on Saturday that a married couple who killed 14 people in California in an attack the FBI is investigating as an ""act of terrorism"" were followers of the militant group — ""soldiers"" who were ""killed in the path of Allah.""
The group's declaration, in an online radio broadcast comes three days after U.S.-born Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his spouse, Tashfeen Malik, 29, a native of Pakistan, carried out the attack on a holiday party for civil servants in San Bernardino, about 60 miles (100 km)..."

"An attorney for the Ukraine whistleblower sent a letter to the White House on Thursday warning President Trump against publicly criticizing his client.
In the letter obtained by CNN and posted on its site, Andrew Bakaj told White House Counsel Pat Cipollone that Mr. Trump might bear responsibility “should anyone be physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates’, behavior.”
Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the person who complained to an inspector-general about the president’s phone call to his Ukrainian opposite number, calling him a coward and a..."

"Donald Trump’s path to victory in November runs through disaffected white working voters who the GOP hopes can force the election into Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and other states that haven’t been in play for decades.
Analysts said it’s a tricky path, fraught with potential pitfalls — not least of which is Mr. Trump’s own brash style, which could alienate millions of moderate and independent voters and could help keep minority turnout at the 2008 and 2012 rates that powered President Obama to two victories."
"U.S. Customs and Border Patrol issued a ban on imports of cotton and tomatoes from the Xinjiang region in China, citing Beijing’s use of forced labor.
Around 20 percent of the world’s cotton is picked in Xinjiang, and the region is also a major exporter of tomatoes, which are used to make ketchup for the U.S. market. The U.S. imported $9 billion in cotton products and $10 million in tomatoes from China during the past year."

Speaking little more than a month after the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama unveiled his proposals surrounded by victims families and four children..."
"A congressman who ran for president was compromised by a Chinese espionage operation. And yet, Eric Swalwell remains on the House Intelligence Committee without offering any real explanation of what happened, because ... well, it’s good to be a Democrat!
Swalwell had been close enough with a Chinese intelligence officer that she was able to place an intern in his office. Christine Fang (or Fang Fang) had been in contact with Swalwell as early as his days as a Dublin city councilman in 2012 and had fundraised for his reelection..."
"After spending months spilling ink to delegitimize stories implicating President-elect Joe Biden in his son’s corrupt overseas business dealings, the New York Times has found a new favorite Democrat to protect.
As of this writing Monday morning, the nation’s most influential newspaper — boasting more than 7 million subscribers — has yet to dedicate a single article or news item to the compromising revelations surrounding Democratic House Intelligence Committee member Eric Swalwell cultivating a relationship with a Chinese spy."
"If you're a New York Times subscriber who also watches the broadcast network evening news and considers that your news diet, there's a very good chance you haven't heard about Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and his ties to an accused Chinese spy a few years ago.
To review why this is absolutely worthy of coverage, Swalwell’s interaction with the alleged spy known as Fang Fang included, according to Axios, Fang placing an intern in Swalwell's office and helping to fundraise for his 2014 reelection campaign. In 2015, the FBI..."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden shot down President Donald Trump’s campaign narrative painting him as a radical socialist who is responsible for the recent violence in cities across the country.
Flanked by American flags, Biden told the nation during Monday’s speech in Pittsburgh, “You know me, you know my heart. You know my story, my family’s story. Ask yourself, do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really?”
He continued, “I want a safe America, safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting. Safe from..."
"The old saying ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" is understood to mean it is better to deliver retribution for a perceived or actual injustice after time has passed, in order for it to be done dispassionately. Sometimes it is better not to serve that dish at all. Like perishable food left unrefrigerated, a different kind of ""bacteria"" can infect the nation.
Dispassion is in retreat in Washington and instead of revenge being served cold, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many other Democrats are turning up the heat."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Sunday that more “pain and suffering” is on the horizon as COVID-19 cases climb again and officials plead with unvaccinated Americans to get their shots.
Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, also said he doesn’t foresee additional lockdowns in the U.S. because he believes enough people are vaccinated to avoid a recurrence of last winter. However, he said not enough are inoculated to “crush the outbreak” at this point.
Fauci’s warning comes days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed course to recommend..."
"Tony Bobulinski, Hunter Biden’s former business partner, sat down with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson for a no-holds-barred interview for 45 minutes. Bobulinski didn’t want this interview. He doesn’t need to do it, but his reputation was being smeared as Russian misinformation. He was a guest at the final debate and when the former vice president denied being involved in Hunter’s business dealings, he almost stood up and shouted, “liar.”
He added that Joe Biden is the “big guy” referenced in an equity arrangement with a shady Chinese firm with ties..."
"Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden, claimed in an interview Tuesday that the Biden family shrugged off concerns that Joe Biden’s alleged ties to his son's business deals could put a future presidential campaign at risk.

"Human-caused global warming from the emission of fossil fuels is already affecting extreme weather in every region across the world, which will become more frequent and intense with every additional increment of warming, the United Nations said in a new report Monday.
Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries, especially deep ocean warming, ice sheet melt, and sea-level rise.
But the world is inching closer to reaching a temperature threshold that would lead to even worse consequences unless governments take action in the..."
"Medical experts slammed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the agency admitted to withholding a significant amount of data collected on COVID-19 vaccines from the public.
The CDC refused to publish “large portions” of data gathered on COVID-19 vaccines over concerns that it would be “misinterpreted,” according to The New York Times. CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said that the fear of misrepresentation, along with several other factors, led the government health agency to withhold the information.
Nordlund also said that the data was withheld “because basically, at the end of the..."
"Democrats are split on where they are placing blame for the spiraling crisis at the southern border, as Vice President Harris refuses to comment on the matter, claiming she hasn’t been briefed on the situation.
Liberal Democratic leadership has continued to deflect blame for the crisis on the policies of former President Donald Trump, while progressives remain opposed to the use of migrant detention centers and have expressed their dissatisfaction with Biden.

The press conference featured Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and frontline doctors sharing their views and opinions on coronavirus and the medical response to the pandemic. YouTube (which is owned by Google) and Twitter subsequently removed footage of the press conference as well."
"Russia has appeared to be on the precipice of invading Ukraine for months after amassing a significant troop presence on the border despite the United States and other European countries hoping the standoff could be resolved through diplomacy.
Various U.S. officials have spoken to their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in recent days, though the results are unclear. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin to warn the U.S. would “impose swift and severe costs on Russia” if they invaded. However, a senior administration official told reporters afterward that ""there was no fundamental change in..."
"The United Nations’ human rights chief, whose tenure ended Wednesday, failed to hold China accountable for the genocide it is perpetrating against the minority Uyghur ethnic group, former UN Ambassador Andrew Bremberg told the Daily Caller News Foundation.
A long-awaited report detailing results of the UN’s investigation into China’s alleged human rights abuses, released Wednesday, caps Michelle Bachelet’s tenure as UN high commissioner for human rights. Throughout her time in office, Bachelete has attempted to smooth over allegations of grave human rights abuses, including forced labor, involuntary sterilization, torture and indoctrination, Bremberg, who formerly served as the..."
"Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said President Biden's goal to open the majority of K-8 schools by April 30 falls way short of what school children need, and the Republican Whip urged Biden to choose science over teacher unions.
Scalise, fresh off a call with concerned parents who want their schools reopened, said Biden's goal should be 100% of schools opened within his first 100 days. Anything short of that is a disservice to the children who are suffering, Scalise told Fox News in an interview Thursday.
""Either you are going..."
"The battle between congressional Democrats and the Justice Department over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report has reached new levels of vitriol, as some on the left call for Attorney General Bill Barr to be physically dragged in to testify or even locked up for defying congressional subpoenas."
"South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduced a bill Monday that would decriminalize marijuana nationwide.
The bill, titled the States Reform Act, would strike marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act while still allowing states to regulate the drug as they see fit, a news release touting the legislation said. It would establish a 3% federal marijuana tax which would help “fund law enforcement, small businesses and veterans mental health initiatives.”
“Every state is different. Cannabis reform at the federal level must take all of this into account,” Mace said in a press conference Monday...."
"The House passed a standalone continuing resolution aimed at averting a government shutdown on Thursday, with the bill expected to be sent to President Biden’s desk before current funding expires at midnight. 
The vote was 254-175.
The Senate passed the measure 65-35 earlier in the day.
The stopgap bill includes language to keep the government funded through Dec. 3 in addition to disaster relief funding and funding to aid with the resettlement of Afghan refugees. 
Its passage comes after Senate Republicans blocked a House-passed short-term spending bill that included language to raise..."
"New York Attorney General Letitia James has taken legal action to force former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump to cooperate with her investigation into the Trump Organization’s financial dealings.
James on Tuesday filed a motion seeking a court order to compel the three family members to appear for sworn testimony as required by subpoenas that have been issued to the Trumps by her office.
The attorney general’s action came in response to an earlier motion filed by Trump and the two children to quash the interviews..."
"Today is a federal holiday. That holiday is not “Presidents’ Day.” No such holiday exists in law. It is George Washington’s birthday.
Washington’s birthday has been celebrated since he was encamped with our first army at Valley Forge in 1778. It first became an official state holiday in Massachusetts in 1856, and a federal holiday in 1879. Since the 1968 passage of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which subordinated historical accuracy to the preferences of federal workers for three-day weekends, Washington’s birthday has been celebrated on the third Monday of February, which..."
"Texas Republicans over the weekend approved a swath of controversial changes to their party’s platform, coming out in full force against LGBT rights and taking a hard right turn on several other issues.
The platform adopted by convention delegates at the conclusion of the party’s 2022 state convention included policy statements calling homosexuality an “abnormal lifestyle choice” and opposing “all efforts to validate transgender identity.”
“We believe there should be no granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior, regardless of state of origin, and we oppose any criminal or..."

Not coincidentally, tested in three swing states — Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia — against the presumptive Democratic nominee, a new Quinnipiac University poll finds all three are also"
"Speculation that President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee are petitioning cellphone carriers to monitor and edit private text messages is false, DNC and White House officials tell the Washington Examiner.
Still, political operatives from both parties have made a practice of monitoring mass text blasts from the other side in recent years as SMS marketing has exploded as a tool for political campaigns, fundraising groups, and even private sector businesses.
The notion of new Democratic-backed SMS surveillance popped up in conservative circles after Politico published an article Monday that included a line that the DNC and other..."

Four of her cabinet ministers resigned today, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, setting up a very difficult vote in Parliament over the plan:"
"In 2010, U.S. life expectancy stopped rising. In 2014, it actually began to decline. This reversal can be largely attributed to an increase in the mortality rate of Americans between the ages of 25 and 64, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. U.S. life expectancy rose from 69.9 years in 1959 to 78.9 years in 2014. Average U.S. life expectancy declined in each of the following three years and is now at 78.6 years.
The decline was greater for men (0.4 years) than..."

"Fresh off a series of weekend victories in state caucuses, Bernie Sanders turned up the heat on Hillary Clinton at Sunday’s debate in Flint, Mich., sharply challenging her economic credentials and suggesting her gun control stand would ban guns in America. But the Democratic front-runner fought back, blasting him for voting against the auto bailout, dismissing him as a “one-issue candidate” and hitting him once again for his stance on guns."
"The number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits last week unexpectedly rose off the lowest levels since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Data released Thursday by the Labor Department showed 373,000 Americans filed for first-time jobless benefits in the week ended July 3, up from an upwardly revised 371,000 filings the week prior. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a decline to 350,000 filings.
Despite last week's small increase the number of initial jobless claims have been more than halved this year after reaching a peak of 904,000 in January. Almost 6 million..."
"The chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Sunday that President Obama is notably cautious — “maybe, in this instance, too cautious” — but insisted the U.S. and its allies will coalesce behind a plan to beat back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria before their well-funded sources take Baghdad.
Mr. Obama raised eyebrows last week when he admitted that the U.S. does not have a strategy yet to defeat the movement."
"Jennifer Sey, former brand president for the U.S. clothing company Levi’s, quit her c-suite position and turned down a $1 million payout so she could continue to speak out against certain COVID-19 restrictions.
Sey, a former Olympic gymnast, announced her resignation on Monday in journalist Bari Weiss’ Substack newsletter “Common Sense.” Sey said she was pushed out of her job by the company she had championed over her 23-year career because she refused to stop speaking out against school closures and other COVID-19 policies.

"The 2016 presidential campaign rumbled through Indiana Sunday focused on Tuesday’s critical primary, even as front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump itched to fully engage in the one-on-one battle they cast as inevitable.
But the underdogs in both parties made clear they had no plans to exit the race, at least until the Indiana results come in — and perhaps longer.

"The U.S. government’s congressional watchdog determined that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid to Ukraine in the summer of 2019.
The Government Accountability Office released a nine-page report Thursday concluding the Office of Management and Budget violated the Impoundment Control Act when it held up $214 million appropriated by Congress to the Department of Defense to help Ukraine as it deals with a Russian incursion in the eastern part of its country."
"The United States has surpassed 25 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began.
The new milestone, reported Sunday by Johns Hopkins University, is a grim reminder of the coronavirus’ wide reach in the U.S., which has seen far more confirmed cases and deaths than any other country in the world.
The U.S. accounts for roughly one of every four cases reported worldwide and one of every five deaths. India has recorded the second most cases, with about 10.7 million."
"After the data submitted by Pfizer for its COVID-19 vaccine for children received a thumbs up by the FDA panel last week, the anticipated nudging of parents began.
Anthony Fauci said, “Even though the chances of (a child) getting sick and seriously ill are small, why do you want to take a chance of that with your child, when you can essentially protect the child by an intervention that is proven to be both highly effective and very safe?”
Andrew Pavia from University of Utah Health likewise stated potential risks of the..."
"Flanked by 13 people identified as having benefited from Obamacare – one of whom nearly fainted during his remarks – President Barack Obama insisted that his signature health care law is bigger than a problematic website.
“Nobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn’t working as well as it should, which means it’s going to get fixed,” Obama said from the White House Rose Garden Monday.
But the president gave no timeline or date as to when the online health exchanges that opened Oct. 1 will..."
"President Biden marked what he called the “tragic milestone” of 1 million US deaths from COVID-19 Thursday by insisting that Congress approve billions of dollars in new spending to boost America’s pandemic response.
“As a nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow,” the president said in an early morning statement. “To heal, we must remember. We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible, as we have with more testing, vaccines, and treatments than ever before. It’s critical that Congress..."
"President Trump on Monday seized on a New York University professor’s false tweet as an example of journalistic malpractice while calling for the U.S. to modify its libel laws to hold news media accountable.
In his early morning tweet while on an overseas trip to Japan, the president said a fake quote attributed to him by Ian Bremmer shows ""what’s going on in the age of Fake News.""
""People think they can say anything and get away with it,"" Trump wrote. ""Really, the libel laws should be changed to hold..."
"President Joe Biden says he isn’t “reading anything into” statements from Russian officials signaling that the Russian military is drawing back some of its troops near the Ukrainian capitol of Kyiv.
Face-to-face negotiations between Russia and Ukraine Tuesday in Turkey yielded the first steps towards peace between the two nations more than a month into the war that has left thousands dead or injured and displaced nearly four million Ukrainians.
During the talks, Russia proposed drawing down its troop presence in and around Kyiv while Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status on the international stage.

The ambitious timeline — less than three months away — comes days after US health regulators approved a third vaccine, developed by Johnson & Johnson, which requires a single shot rather than two.
The White House announced Tuesday that it will use the Defense Production Act to help..."
"President Joe Biden will meet face to face with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time as commander in chief next month.

"“Fight for Fifteen” is old news, it would seem. In California, they may soon have a $22/hour minimum wage—at least for fast food employees.
The “FAST Act” is headed to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk after recently passing through the state legislature. As the Wall Street Journal reports, it would “create a government panel that would set wages for an estimated half-million fast food workers in the state.”
“The bill would establish a panel with members appointed by the governor and legislative leaders composed of workers, union representatives, employers and business advocates,” the Journal explains. “They..."
"Former President Barack Obama said in a commencement speech on Saturday that current leaders during the coronavirus crisis were failing 2020 graduates.

"The Biden administration is suing Idaho to block the state's abortion ""trigger law,"" arguing it has violated federal law requiring hospitals to provide medically necessary treatment to patients before discharging them.
Attorney General Merrick Garland detailed the lawsuit at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, arguing that federal law preempts state laws imposing near total bans on abortion.
“On the day Roe and Casey were overturned, we promised that the Justice Department would work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom,” Garland said, according to KXAS-TV. “That is what we are doing, and that..."

"The Trump administration is set to propose a rule Tuesday that would cut about 3.1 million Americans from the food-stamp program in an effort to save taxpayers about $2.5 billion a year, reports said.
The U.S. has seen low levels of unemployment, which is seen as a major factor in low levels of participation in the program. President Trump tweeted earlier this month that food stamp use is at a 10-year low. Politifact verified the claim.
Reuters, citing a U.S. Department of Agriculture, reported that residents in 43 states who..."

"Approaching his 500th day in office this week, Joe Biden is the least popular U.S. president at this point in his first term in the modern polling era. His approval rating might drop even further now that Americans are home from their Memorial Day weekend travels. According to AAA, this was one of the most expensive Memorial Day travel periods on record, with gas prices hitting $4.62 — the highest average price at the pump ever recorded.
But as Americans were struggling to put gas in the tank, President Biden appeared to praise high gas prices as..."

"Former President Trump’s legal team opposed the Justice Department’s motion to continue its review of classified documents seized by the FBI during its raid of Mar-a-Lago last month, slamming the entire investigation as ""unprecedented and misguided,"" and one that has ""spiraled out of control,"" while stressing that the government has not yet proven that the records ""remain classified.""

"So Tucker Carlson is in Hungary this week. He had a brief meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and he seems to be using the August lull in the news cycle to teach his audience about Orbán’s form of politics, which are conservative, nationalist, and activist. Orbán’s party talks about preserving Hungary’s Christian character, it opposed mass migration into Hungary in the middle of the last decade, and it has tried dramatic experiments in state inducements to childbirth."
"President Trump on Monday proposed a fiscal year 2020 budget plan that would boost federal funding for a handful of favored agencies, but cut most others in a bid to slow the rate of growth of the federal government.
Trump proposed increases for the Departments of Commerce (up 9.3 percent), Defense (up 5 percent), Homeland Security (up 7.8 percent), and Veterans Affairs (up 7.5 percent), as well as NASA and the Small Business Administration.
Others see much more dramatic cuts, according to the budget the House Democrats have already said..."
"The House approved a two-year spending plan on Thursday evening, in a strong bipartisan vote that underscored the desire by many lawmakers to avoid a repeat of the October budget showdown.
The bill was approved 332-94, over the objections of conservatives concerned it would increase spending in the short-term and liberals concerned it would not extend long-term jobless aid.
The bill now goes to the Senate. The House vote indicates the bill could be on a relatively clear path to the president’s desk, in sharp contrast to the protracted budget..."

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., claimed that the incident “puts to bed, forever, the question of whether the way to deal with bad guys with guns is to make sure there are more good guys with guns.”
Well, “forever” ended this weekend, when a 22-year-old fatally shot a man armed with an AR-15 who had opened fire in a mall food court in Greenwood, Indiana, killing three. We don’t know all the specifics — and we’ll never..."
The Trump administration has fulfilled another one of Donald Trump’s campaign promises by rescinding the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program implemented under Barack Obama that could have allowed as many as five million illegal aliens with children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents to remain in the country if they met certain criteria.
"Theresa May vowed to restore Britain's 'self-determination' today as the historic letter confirming our EU divorce was finally delivered to Brussels - including a stark warning that trying to punish the UK would be a 'costly mistake'.
The Prime Minister delivered an upbeat vision of a UK whose 'best days lie ahead' as she confirmed her envoy Sir Tim Barrow had handed the formal notification to European Council president Donald Tusk in Brussels."
"If you don’t imbibe the noxious prattle-on-demand that calls itself cable television “news,” you might not realize that a crew of pundits and talking heads has spent much of the last few weeks warning that the fall of Kabul to the Taliban will mean an invasive flood of Afghan refugees pouring into our streets, ravaging our daughters, and imposing sharia law on our cul-de-sacs and HOAs.
Never mind that those refugees are running from the imposition of an especially brutal form of sharia law, or that to fight a terrorist cell, we invaded..."

"President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is a perfect response to President Obama’s benighted decision to change American policy by engineering the United Nations Security Council Resolution declaring Judaism’s holiest places in Jerusalem to be occupied territory and a “flagrant violation under international law.” It was President Obama who changed the status quo and made peace more difficult, by handing the Palestinians enormous leverage in future negotiations and disincentivizing them from making a compromised peace."
"Hunter Biden declined to challenge the authenticity of the laptop that prompted news reports and a subsequent blackout by big tech companies on Biden’s overseas business dealings and other affairs.
Biden told CBS News’ Tracy Smith in an interview set to air on April 4 that he does not know if the laptop at the center of reports on emails between him and his business associates is his or not. The laptop also allegedly contained images of Biden using illicit drugs and engaging in sexual acts with an unidentified woman."

"The Pentagon admitted it made a “tragic mistake” after 10 civilians were killed in a U.S. airstrike in Kabul. Top officials acknowledged the error on Friday, saying the strike killed three adults and seven children and not ISIS-K terrorists as originally reported.

The protection from the vaccine’s primary two-dose regimen has dropped to about 70 percent in recent weeks, according to Discovery Health, the largest private health insurance company in the country.
That was down from 93 percent when the Delta was the dominant variant of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus in the country, Discovery scientists said Tuesday. The CCP virus causes COVID-19.

"Keen to undermine House Republicans's entire impeachment strategy, President Trump took to Twitter to attack Marie Yovanovitch for not single-handedly saving Somalia, a failed state in its third decade of civil war, and Ukraine, from which he expunged her. Crucially, he did this as Yovanovitch was publicly testifying to the House Intelligence Committee as a part of the impeachment proceedings against Trump.
There's no question that Trump's personal advisers and attorneys ought to lock his phone in a vault for the duration of the impeachment proceedings, if not for the..."

"Acting Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli announced a change in the “public charge” rule Monday that will deny green cards for immigrants on Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers, and other public welfare. It of course elicited liberally charged questions from reporters.
The “public charge” rule, enacted in 1882, requires green card applicants to prove they will not be a burden to the United States. The new changes, detailed in an 800-page document going into effect mid-October, will determine “the totality of the circumstances when making a public..."

"The national debt of the United States blew past $31 trillion for the first time ever Tuesday, a grim milestone that comes amid soaring interest rates that threaten to strain the government's finances.
It comes just nine months after the last milestone of $30 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and only five years after reaching $20 trillion. The unprecedented spree of government borrowing brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic, and further borrowing to stimulate the economy, has helped to contribute to the majority of this figure.

"President Biden attempted to downplay the U.S. inflation crisis during a ""60 Minutes"" interview, claiming that the month-to-month rate has ""hardly"" risen – which prompted his CBS interviewer to dispute his response.
CBS correspondent Scott Pelley asked: ""Mr. President, as you know, last Tuesday, the annual inflation rate came in at 8.3%. The stock market nosedived. People are shocked by their grocery bills. What can you do better and faster?""
Biden quickly told Pelley he needed to ""put this in perspective"" and that the inflation rate month-to-month was ""up just an inch,..."
"The U.S. recorded a grim milestone Tuesday with over 600,000 deaths attributed to coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. However, the news comes as weekly fatalities have declined to lows not seen since early on in the pandemic.
The latest data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate a seven-day moving average of about 330 deaths, figures not seen since March 2020. Health officials owe the dropoff in deaths to a significant proportion of the country’s vaccinated population; federal data suggests 54% of adults are..."
"President Donald Trump has provided the special counsel with written answers to questions about his knowledge of Russian interference in the 2016 election, his lawyers said Tuesday, avoiding at least for now a potentially risky sit-down with prosecutors. It’s the first time he has directly cooperated with the long investigation."
"The Idaho Supreme Court temporarily blocked implementation of an abortion law modeled on Texas’s bill banning abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected.
The court granted the stay in response to a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood. The organization operates three of the four abortion providers based in the state, according to the Idaho Statesman.
The temporary stay means that Idaho’s abortion law will not go into effect as scheduled on April 22, as both sides prepare for expected arguments. The Supreme Court must rule on the lawsuit before the bill can take effect.

"President Trump announced on Monday a set of guidelines that he said Americans should follow to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus -- despite admitting that the pandemic could stretch into July or August.
Speaking during a briefing of the coronavirus task force, Trump outlined a plan to slow the spread of COVID-19 in 15 days.
“With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly,” Trump said. “Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes.”
At another point during the news conference,..."
"Dennis DeWitt says he typically doesn’t get involved in politics until it is time to vote, but he took the opportunity here Friday to throw his support behind President Trump in the Iowa State Fair’s popular “corn kernel poll.”
Mr. Trump is showing his strength in the informal survey of fairgoers, which through Thursday night showed that half of the more than 4,700 kernels cast had gone for Republicans and half had gone for Democrats."
"The joke in Britain is that the country is becoming like Italy – but without the weather.  In other words – ungovernable.
Just as Italian politics seem to throw up a new government most weeks, so the UK seems to be churning through Prime Ministers.  Liz Truss announced her resignation on Thursday after a mere six weeks.  The shortest-lived Prime Minister in history, she´d barely unpacked her bags in Downing Street before having to pack them back up again.
Her successor – due to be announced next week – will be the country´s..."
"Alphabet's Google will pay about $400 million to settle a complaint brought by a group of states over allegations the search and advertising giant illegally tracked users' locations, two people familiar with the matter said.
The announcement will come as early as Monday, the sources said.
The lawsuit, which includes Oregon, the people said, is a sign of mounting legal headaches for the tech company from state attorneys general who have aggressively targeted the firm's user tracking practices in recent months.
Arizona filed a similar case against Google and settled..."
"A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend the agency let millions of Americans get a booster of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.
The 19–0 vote came after hours of discussions and presentations in an all-virtual meeting.
Moderna officials presented data from clinical trials, including a small trial that studied the safety and effectiveness of a booster, as did officials from Israel, one of the first countries in the world to start giving boosters, and the FDA, which performed an analysis of Moderna’s data but did not support..."
"Hours of audio recordings from grand-jury proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case were made public Friday, giving a rare glimpse into what the Kentucky panel heard before it returned no indictments against cops for her killing.
One of the officers who shot Taylor described in recorded testimony the chaotic scene he found himself in when he walked into the apartment.
The cop, Detective Myles Cosgrove, said he saw a barrage of flashing lights and that he was “overwhelmed” with bright flashes and darkness.
He added that he saw a shadowy..."
"Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are considering changing their guidance and encouraging people to wear masks when they go out in public.
But The Washington Post noted there is still no agreement on whether the use of facial coverings would make a major difference in curtailing the outbreak of the coronavirus.
And some experts are concerned it could provide people with a false sense of security and make them less likely to follow social distancing guidelines.
A recommendation now being considered by the CDC calls for..."
"Lawmakers on Christmas Eve blocked each other’s competing bills that attempted to rectify President Trump’s objections to a massive spending and coronavirus aid package.
Trump has warned he will not sign legislation that bundles $900 billion in coronavirus aid with the $1.4 trillion 2021 government spending bill.
Trump wants lawmakers to make changes to the massive spending package to remove “wasteful” spending and to increase the virus aid stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 for individuals."
"The birthplace of the free speech movement has become its graveyard. Hundreds of liberals rioted at the University of California Berkeley Wednesday night -- burning stores, throwing Molotov cocktails and clashing with police.
The rampaging mob forced the university to shut down an event featuring gay conservative firebrand and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos.
“I’m outraged that Milo has been given a platform at UC Berkeley, and there should be no place for him here,” visiting assistant art professor Samara Haplerin told the Daily Californian. “He should be scared that people..."
"Children as young as five are to be offered the bivalent Covid booster vaccine ahead of the winter.
The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended five to 11-year-olds get a single dose of Pfizer's updated shot.
Children aged six and above can get Moderna's bivalent booster. Both new vaccines offer better protection against the new Omicron variants than previous jabs.
Officials are now 'encouraging' parents to get their children vaccinated before schools go back from the fall break.
But many experts have repeatedly rallied against plans to inoculate..."
"Hillary Clinton is keeping the heat on Donald Trump, saying “we are trying to elect a president, not a dictator.”
The likely Democratic nominee for president addressed an enthusiastic crowd in San Bernardino, California, Friday night, where she continued to question her likely Republican opponent’s qualifications."
"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky on Tuesday signed off on the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 just hours after an agency panel OK’d the shot — paving the way for an estimated 28 million young kids to begin getting their jabs as soon as this week.
The final approval comes after a panel of doctors and public-health experts forming the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the move. The FDA had already cleared the immunization for emergency use in the age group Friday.

"President Trump explains why Sondland shouldn't testify.
@realDonaldTrump
I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican’s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland’s tweet, which few report, stated, “I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” That says it ALL!..."
"Twitter permanently booted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from the social-media platform Sunday, saying she had repeatedly violated its policies by posting misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic.
The Georgia Republican’s personal account “@mtgreenee” was permanently blocked, although her congressional account “@RepMTG” is still online.
“We permanently suspended the account you referenced (@mtgreenee) for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,” Twitter said in a statement. “We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy.”

"George H.W. Bush penned an emotional, inspirational letter to incoming President Bill Clinton during his last hours in the White House.
Dated Jan. 20, 1993, Bush's note — handwritten at his desk in the Oval Office— reads:
""When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too. I wish you great happiness here.

"In the latest Democrat move to undermine the American system of government, a majority of the New York City council is poised to passed Int. No. 1867 which gives non-citizens the right to vote in municipal elections.  Under this law, those who lack citizenship may, if they reside in New York City for only thirty days, vote for mayor, city council, borough presidents, comptroller, and public advocate.  They may thus influence what law and policy governs the citizens of New York City.  The law is patently unconstitutional, unlawful under immigration law, an..."
"Short of adopting wire-frame glasses and a Brooklyn accent, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein did everything possible last weekend to blur any distinction between herself and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
“It is such an honor to be also running in alliance with the Bernie Sanders movement,” Ms. Stein said to thunderous applause at the Green Party Presidential Nominating Convention in Houston. “We are Bernie Green!”
To nobody’s surprise, Ms. Stein, a Harvard-educated physician and prohibitive front-runner, won the nomination Saturday at the University of Houston. She..."

Ron DeSantis, R., gave the Publix grocery store chain preferable treatment to offer the coronavirus vaccine based on its donations to his PAC despite growing pressure.

"US hiring remained strong in October, though the national unemployment rate ticked higher than expected in a trend that could affirm the Federal Reserve’s move toward smaller interest rate hikes at a pivotal meeting next month.
Employers hired at a robust clip, adding a higher-than-expected 261,000 jobs last month, according to Labor Department data. Prior to the announcement, economists had expected employers to add 205,000 jobs.
The US unemployment rate ticked upward to 3.7% — worse than the 3.5% rate economists projected. However, the rate is still hovering near a five-decade low."
"As the Omicron variant is causing a surge in COVID-19 infections across 30 provinces and municipalities in China, Beijing’s “zero-COVID” restrictions appear to be causing more harm than good.
The strict measures are sapping the productivity of businesses, weakening the stock market’s performance, forcing about 400 million people to remain in lockdown, and causing the economy to contract.
Data from China’s multiple indices suggest that the Zero-COVID policy has weakened first-quarter business results and the economy overall.
For example, the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 48.1 in March. A reading of..."
"The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments.
The Trump administration is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network.
The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the..."

"Presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden has released his staff’s diversity statistics, revealing his team is not as diverse as he has claimed. The candidate released these numbers Saturday immediately after a town hall, during which officials called for him to back his diversity claims within his staff.
The former vice president has received mounting pressure to release these figures, but has refused to make this information public for months.
However, he has long boasted his team’s representation."
"House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, the would-be Speaker of the House should the GOP retake the majority as most expect in November’s midterm elections, exclusively previewed the GOP’s forthcoming “Commitment to America” for Breitbart News here in Western Pennsylvania on Thursday evening ahead of the launch on Friday morning.

"Nikole Hannah-Jones, founder of the controversial 1619 Project, declined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's offer for tenure and will instead join the faculty of Howard University.
She announced her decision not to join UNC on Tuesday morning, about a week after the university's board of trustees voted 9-4 to grant her request for tenure after she refused to accept the position without it. The reporter would have been named chairwoman in race and investigative journalism at UNC’s Hussman School of Journalism and Media.
Instead of joining her alma mater, Hannah-Jones accepted..."
"Billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg on Wednesday dropped out of the Democratic presidential race after a humiliating rejection by voters on Super Tuesday.
He said he wasn’t giving up on the fight to defeat President Trump and threw his support — and his fortune — behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.
“While I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life,” he said in a message to supporters. “I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting..."
"The first Senate casualty of ObamaCare? He made news twice last week, once for voting against the Democrats gun-control bills and the other for warning that ObamaCare, of which he was a lead architect, would be a “train wreck if not implemented properly. Maybe he hears the train whistle in the distance and figures hell get off the tracks now. As for the gun-control votes, two theories. One: He really does believe in gun rights. Hes not just pandering to his red-state constituency. Two: He was fully prepared to run..."
"Authorities are investigating the possibility that a serial killer has been hunting Muslim people in Albuquerque, New Mexico after four men of the faith were murdered there in the past year.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Saturday that she deployed additional state police to help with the probe into the “targeted killings.”
“The targeted killings of Muslim residents of Albuquerque is deeply angering and wholly intolerable,” she wrote on Twitter.

"Wall Street is “losings its mind” over retail traders that have banded together to take on at least two hedge funds that bet the shares of GameStop would fall, Fox Business host Charles Payne explained Wednesday.
Thanks to their efforts, the video game retailer’s stocks have surged.

"Ohio Gov. John Kasich is expected Tuesday to announce his 2016 White House bid, joining a huge Republican field in which he will try to distinguish himself as a total-package candidate, successful in Washington and at running a state government.
The 63-year-old Kasich will become the 16th GOP candidate -- and perhaps not the last -- when he declares his candidacy at the Ohio State University.
Kasich, known for his bluntness, was overwhelmingly re-elected last year to a second term as governor, winning bipartisan support for cutting taxes and..."

In a shock result at last week’s meet at the University of Pennsylvania, Lia Thomas, of the home team, who has transitioned from male to female, lost the 100- and 400-yard freestyle events to Yale’s Iszac Henig, who is transitioning from female to male.

"Sally Yates, who served as Deputy Attorney General during a critical period as the Russia collusion hoax evolved in 2016-17, trashed fired FBI director James Comey during her testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
She readily agreed that Comey went “rogue” in his unauthorized pursuit of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But that, of course, was stating the obvious. It was too easy. Comey managed to turn himself into a human piñata when he engaged in blatant acts of corruption.
Like Comey, Yates was a model of..."
"With the CDC reporting more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases in a day in the U.S., some Veterans Day events have been canceled this year, but many have been moved online so Americans can still participate in the holiday.
Americans have observed a holiday on Nov. 11 since 1919, a year after fighting ended in World War I. Originally known as Armistice Day, the holiday was later expanded after World War II to celebrate all U.S. veterans.

"Senate Democrats failed to advance a bill to codify Roe v. Wade and create a national right to abortion on Wednesday.
The procedural vote to invoke cloture and advance the Women’s Health Protection Act failed in a 49-to-51 vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer chose to hold the vote despite the near certainty that Democrats would fail to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to break a Republican filibuster and advance the measure.
The largely symbolic vote came after a leaked majority draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization revealed that the Supreme Court could..."

"Juneteenth should be a reminder to never see any group of humans as non-persons. It never works out well for the ones victimized by such evil arrogance. This holiday commemorates the eventual announcement to slaves in Texas, on June 19th 1865, that President Abraham Lincoln had set them free. The Emancipation Proclamation was issued over two years prior on January 1st, 1863. Isn’t this how truth works sometimes? It has to get over so many obstacles to finally be heard and bring the freedom that is its very nature...."
"The agreement in principle announced Wednesday by House and Senate Republican leaders on a tax cut bill – heralded by President Trump at the White House – is good news for the American people.

"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is less effective against the Omicron virus variant than other strains of the CCP virus, the companies said Wednesday, citing interim results from a study they’re running.
Scientists found on average a more than 25-fold reduction in neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant compared to the wild type, “indicating that two doses of BNT162b2 may not be sufficient to protect against infection with the Omicron variant,” the companies said in a statement.
BNT162b2 is another name for the vaccine. The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus causes COVID-19.

"A group of Disney employees staged a walkout on Tuesday at locations across the country, demanding the company do more to protect LGBTQ people and protesting that CEO Bob Chapek waited too long to condemn a bill passed by the Florida legislature.
The legislation that sparked the outcry is the Parents Rights in Education bill, which has been dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by critics. If signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, it would prohibit Florida educators from teaching sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.
Disney has been under fire..."
"President Biden directed agencies to purchase more carbon-free power and electric cars in a sweeping executive order Wednesday meant to have the government weigh climate change in nearly everything it does.
The order also pauses new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, delivering on a campaign promise but creating immediate and fierce tensions with the oil and gas industry and congressional Republicans.
Biden’s order builds on executive actions he took on his first day in office, when he began the process to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and targeted..."

The good results came despite the new, highly transmittable coronavirus variant now circulating in the UK."

The reprogramming action sent to Capitol Hill yesterday cites the urgent need to deter drug smuggling across the southern border — not stopping illegal immigration — as an “unforeseen military requirement,” which it argues is “necessary..."
"Democrats are outraged that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night — and that he delivered the remarks from foreign soil. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Pompeo’s address from Jerusalem “appalling” and accused him of “violating our values in terms of the bipartisanship.”
Please. Where were these critics in August 2016, when then-Vice President Joe Biden attacked Donald Trump from foreign soil while on an official visit overseas? Speaking to allies gathered at a NATO summit in Riga, Latvia, Biden said Trump..."

"Lester Holt bows to the Clinton campaign, and tries to “fact-check” Trump on his support for (or opposition to) the Iraq War.
It happens thus: Holt introduces, matter-of-factly, the premise that Trump supported the Iraq War. Trump pushes back, calling it “mainstream media nonsense.” Trump burns two minutes explaining how he did not support the war, citing Howard Stern and Sean Hannity.
At the end, Holt repeats the allegation again anyway. This is what the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media wanted him to do.
In one gesture, Holt proves..."

"The leaders of our uniformed military — the Joint Chiefs of Staff — have committed an act of common sense that exposes President Obama’s Ebola policy for its comprehensive lack of that commodity. According to a recent report on Fox News, they have called for all troops returning from the Ebola “hot zone” to be quarantined for 21 days."
"Former President Barack Obama on Friday warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to pay attention to what voters actually think -- warning that most of them don’t want to “tear down the system.”
“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.
“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't..."
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday declared a state of “disaster emergency” over gun violence across New York — and announced $138 million in new spending to try to stop the surge in shootings.
“Gun violence and crime should be the top priority for every mayor in this state because every city has been affected by it,” he said.
“It’s a matter of saving lives — and New York’s future depends on it.”
Speaking at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, Cuomo said that “people are not coming back to..."
"Inflation ran hotter than expected in September as persistent prices continued to squeeze U.S. households and worsen a political headache for President Biden with just one month until midterm elections.
The Labor Department said Thursday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 0.4% in September from the previous month. Prices climbed 8.2% on an annual basis. 
Those figures were both higher than the 8.1% headline figure and 0.2% monthly increase forecast by Refinitiv economists, a worrisome sign..."
"Former President Donald Trump said that maybe his vice president should be executed after protesters at the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!” according to witnesses who spoke to the House committee probing the attack.
The New York Times reports that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows left the dining room off the Oval Office and told colleagues in his own office that Mr. Trump was complaining about Mr. Pence being whisked to safety during the Capitol attack — and then made the hanging remark.
It was unclear what kind..."
"Local prosecutors in Minnesota on Wednesday are expected to charge former Brooklyn Center Police Officer Kim Potter with second-degree manslaughter in the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, as civil unrest has persisted for three consecutive nights, with demonstrations spilling into Minneapolis.
Washington County Attorney Pete Orput is expected to announce the second-degree manslaughter charge later Wednesday. Orput did not immediately return a voicemail left by Fox News on Wednesday.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, according to The Associated Press. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, KSTP..."
"Donald Trump's lawyers defended the president against articles of impeachment Saturday morning arguing it’s the Democrats trying to interfere in elections by seeking to remove Trump from the 2020 ballot for doing “absolutely nothing wrong.”
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said Democrats have no case and are doing damage to democracy by trying to undermine the will of American voters.
“For all their talk about election interference, they're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,” Cipollone said in his opening remarks to the Senate...."
Wisconsin Republicans seem to have it all. Native son Paul Ryan is Mitt Romneys running mate. Gov. Scott Walker is a national conservative hero after surviving a recall vote. Former Gov. Tommy Thompson is vying to capture an open Senate seat held for more than 50 years by Democrats. And Wisconsins own Reince Priebus heads the Republican National Committee.
"This is hilarious. Neil Young tried to pick a fight with Spotify over Joe Rogan—and he lost. It wasn’t really a fight. The streaming service quickly cut ties with Young who demanded that all his music be removed because Joe Rogan is a bad, bad man or something. It was really over the podcaster’s remarks about COVID that the Left has branded misinformation because Rogan is no pro-stab everyone with a needle (via WSJ):

"The Biden administration said it will follow in the footsteps of the European Union and impose sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin over his decision to send troops into Ukraine.
“Following a telephone conversation President Biden held with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and in alignment with the decision by our European allies, the United States will join them in sanctioning President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov and members of the Russian national security team,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday."
"Has any question taken up more airtime at the Democratic debates than how to pay for Medicare for All? The question keeps being asked partly because multiple estimates have found that the single-payer plan, which would eliminate virtually all private health insurance, would require more than $30 trillion in additional government spending over a decade, a historically unprecedented sum. But it has also been a fixture because of the way it has caused candidates to stumble in revealing ways.
No primary candidate is more closely associated with Medicare for..."
"The Justice Department watchdog excoriated the FBI for relying upon British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier in obtaining Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to monitor onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who released a report on Monday showing his findings regarding allegations of surveillance abuses, also found the FISA process was significantly flawed and marred by serious mistakes and missteps, but determined that the initiation of the Trump-Russia investigation itself crossed the low threshold to be properly predicated and was not influenced by political bias as some..."
"After two months lived under the threat of coronavirus, the key characteristic of the crisis remains uncertainty. We don’t know where the virus came from. We still don’t know for sure all the ways it attacks the body, which is a big part of why we still don’t know how best to treat it. We certainly don’t know how to cure it. And as it spreads—despite our best efforts, among asymptomatic carriers and carriers not yet symptomatic and carriers who have no choice but to keep coming into contact with..."
"A look at some of the noteworthy cases the Supreme Court will hear this term, which begins Monday:
—Mistaken traffic stop: A broken brake light led a North Carolina police officer to pull over a car in which cocaine was later found. Turns out, the state requires only one functioning brake light. The court is weighing a case about whether a defendant's constitutional protection against unreasonable searches was violated because of the officer's mistaken understanding of the law.
—Prison beards: An Arkansas inmate is challenging a prison policy that prevents..."
"Disgraced television host Chris Cuomo announced Tuesday night that he has landed a new job in the news media and that he is going to try to be fair after he was routinely criticized for being a hardcore leftist while at CNN.

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that GOP lawmakers are growing more concerned about Rep. Liz Cheney’s ability to carry out her duties as conference chair.
Mr. McCarthy insisted the anti-Cheney sentiment has nothing to do with her vote to impeach former President Trump after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
“I have heard from members concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message,” Mr. McCarthy said on “Fox & Friends.”
“We all need to be working as..."
"Janet Napolitano is resigning as head of the Homeland Security Department and seeking a post as president of the University of California, the long-time Obama confidant announced Friday.
Officials told Fox News that Napolitano does not plan to leave her post until September. But she announced the move on Friday after it began to break in the media, revealing that she has been nominated to lead the California university system.
""For more than four years I have had the privilege of serving President Obama and his Administration as..."
"Secret Service Director Julia Pierson House should be ousted from her job, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday, agreeing with the recommendation of the top Democrat on the oversight committee.
Mrs. Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in American politics, said problems go beyond Ms. Pierson, who was put in charge of the Secret Service after a scandal involving agents who hired prostitutes in Cartagena in 2012. But Mrs. Pelosi said she accepts the analysis of Rep Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, who said he was displeased..."
"Growing up, I spent Memorial Day sitting on the street curb in the tiny farming town of Wanamingo, Minnesota—eating my melting snow cone and watching the commemorative parade make its way down a wide Main Street. Many other American kids had similar experiences. High school marching bands, volunteer fire crews, waving city leaders, and antique tractors all brought smiles and chuckles to spirited onlookers—a slice of Americana."
"The Trump administration will begin blocking business transactions in the United States with popular Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok and messaging app WeChat starting on Sunday.
The Commerce Department announced the new rules barring TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Friday, but it could be rescinded depending on whether a deal that addresses national security concerns is reached.
“Today’s actions prove once again that President Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party,” Commerce..."
"President Trump added fuel to the conspiracy theories surrounding multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide on Saturday when he retweeted a post that implied former President Bill Clinton was linked to Epstein's death.
The tweet came from self-described comedian Terrence K. Williams who echoed many on social media in suggesting a connection between the Clintons and Epstein, who previously was an acquaintance of the former president.
""Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,"" the tweet read, alongside a photo of Epstein and one of..."

"Two Pennsylvania judges served blows to President Trump’s re-election campaign on Friday, tossing out a combined six cases challenging absentee ballots.
Judge James Crumlish of Philadelphia County’s Court of Common Pleas ruled in five related cases that the Trump campaign can’t scrap a total of 8,329 mail-in ballots that it had alleged were improper because the outer envelopes lack names, dates or addresses, The Hill reported.
In his ruling, Crumlish noted that the campaign was “not contending that there has been fraud, that there is evidence of fraud or that..."
"In 1974, some 20,000 pro-life Americans gathered at the steps of the United States Capitol to observe the first anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Every year since, thousands of Americans of all stripes have faithfully flooded the streets of Washington, D.C. to defend the cause of the unborn. On Friday, they will do the same for the 49th time—and hopefully the last of the Roe era.
This summer, the Supreme Court is set to rule in the case of Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The case deals with..."
"The covid-19 lockdown has served its purpose. The time has come to end it.
The objective of the lockdown was never to stop every American from getting covid-19, which is impossible; it was to buy time to learn about the virus and prevent our health-care system from being overwhelmed. We have accomplished those goals. The Trump administration is on track to procure nearly 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year, and New York has so many it is sending them to other states. The Army Corps of Engineers spent..."
"Rep. Liz Cheney said Sunday that Congress is mulling whether to issue a criminal referral to the Justice Department against former President Donald Trump for “unlawfully” seeking to obstruct certification of the 2020 election.
Mrs. Cheney, Wyoming Republican, told CNN that the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol had uncovered significant evidence that Mr. Trump and aides had acted improperly.
“It’s absolutely clear that what President Trump was dealing with, what the number of people around him were doing, that they knew it was unlawful [and] they did it anyway,” Mrs. Cheney said on “State of the Union.” “I think..."
"Congressional Democratic leaders walked out of a Wednesday meeting with President Trump on Syria policy after Trump allegedly insulted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
""He was insulting, particularly to the speaker ... He called her a third-rate politician,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on the White House driveway.
Schumer accused Trump of delivering a ""nasty diatribe"" when defending his decision this month to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which resulted in a Turkish attack on formerly U.S.-allied Kurds.
The meeting occurred moments after the House voted 354-60 to rebuke..."
"Jeb Bush is “moving forward” on a potential 2016 White House run and it appears more likely he’ll enter the Republican race, according to his son who’s running for office in Texas.
George P. Bush told ABC’s “This Week” that his father is “still assessing” a presidential bid, but it seems more likely he’ll seek the presidency this time. The former Florida governor declined to run for president in 2012 despite encouragement from Republicans."
"A soldier in the U.S. Army was charged with attempting to carry out a “mass casualty” terrorist attack on his own unit overseas by leaking sensitive info to the Order of the Nine Angles, a Neo-Nazi and satanic group, the Justice Department announced on Monday.
U.S. Army Pvt. Ethan Melzer, 22, was arrested “for allegedly planning an attack on his U.S. Army unit by sending sensitive details about the unit — including information about its location, movements, and security” to the occult-based extremist group which he secretly joined in 2019...."

Journalist Drew Hernandez posted video footage on Twitter of the riots, which he said were being led by Black Lives Matter activists. The videos show businesses being looted and set on fire.
Wisconsin Democratic Governor Tony Evers released a statement shortly after the incident happened that criticized law enforcement officials while stating at the same time “we do not have all..."
"U.S. stocks ended the Monday session mostly lower as commodity prices eased off recent highs and investors look ahead to the Federal Reserve's likely rate hike on Wednesday. The Russia-Ukraine conflict also remains a driver of volatility.

"Russian troops attacked a packed railway station in eastern Ukraine Friday morning and dozens were feared dead. 
At least 39 people were killed, according to the regional governor. More than 100 were also hurt in the attack, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said. 
""Russians carried out two missile strikes on railway station in Kramatorsk, where evacuation of civilians was taking place,"" the ministry tweeted. ""But Russian war criminals not only deliberately targeted thousands of people; they've used cluster munitions.""
The station was being used to evacuate civilians.

"President Donald Trump and numerous journalists slammed left-wing CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang on Monday over her behavior during the White House Coronavirus Task Force news conference.
First, Jiang falsely suggested that Trump delayed widespread testing to cover-up the extent of the coronavirus testing in the U.S. so he could reopen the economy.
The Washington Post and The New York Times had reported already that the delay in testing came from manufacturing errors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) where the tests were accidentally contaminated and testing..."
"The Trump campaign dismissed a number of editorial boards at major news publications that have announced their support for impeaching President Trump.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote this week on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It will then go to the Senate for a trial, where it's expected to be dismissed quickly.
The Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and USA Today have all called for Trump to be..."
"The European Union ramped up pressure on Russian leader Vladimir Putin by adopting tough new economic sanctions against Russia, as pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine suffered their biggest battlefield setback in months.
The measures, which were prepared in coordination with the United States, include an arms embargo, and a ban on the sale of dual use and sensitive technologies, such as advanced energy technology equipment relevant for deep sea and Arctic drilling. Such equipment will now be subject to prior approval by competent national authorities, an EU official said."
"The strong economic recovery came to a surprising halt amid the federal government reporting only 266,000 new net jobs created in April. Axios adds that “forecasters had floated gains close to 1 million, making this the biggest miss, relative to expectations, in decades.” And that is not the only bad news: March’s booming 916,000 net jobs gain was also revised down to 770,000.

"The New York Times and others on the Left linked Fox News personality Tucker Carlson to Saturday’s horrific massacre in Buffalo, despite no evidence the shooter is a fan or even watched the conservative cable news host’s highly rated show.
The Times cited the gunman’s alleged support for so-called “replacement theory,” an anti-semitic conspiracy theory that claims Jews are importing minorities to change the country’s racial makeup. Some have conflated that theory with claims that Democrats favor amnesty for illegal immigrants in order to change the voting demographics of the country, which Carlson has..."

"They spent the weekend blaming each other for the $85 billion in sequestration cuts that began taking effect Friday Ã¢â‚¬â€ but top Democrats and Republicans were careful Sunday to keep the door open to a breakthrough deal on the federal budget.
Both sides claimed to find the sequestration abhorrent, but leaders from both parties stressed Sunday that they now have an opportunity to find the “big deal Ã¢â‚¬â€ one that tackles politically treacherous territory such as entitlement reform and an overhaul of the tax code Ã¢â‚¬â€ that has eluded..."
"We won’t know for some time how well the message is received.
Black power has arrived. For the first time in modern memory, both of America’s major political parties are making an all-out push for the votes of African Americans.

The hunt for Black votes is a given with Democrats, but the first night of the Republican Convention showed that two teams are chasing the same prize this year. Count me as surprised at the GOP’s bold effort to woo members of..."

"The Trump administration on Tuesday ended the most popular forms of U.S. travel to Cuba, banning cruise ships and a heavily used category of educational travel in an attempt to cut off cash to the island's communist government.
Cruise travel from the U.S. to Cuba began in May 2016 during President Barack Obama's opening with the island.
It has become the most popular form of U.S. leisure travel to the island, bringing 142,721 people in the first four months of the year, a more than 300% increase over the..."

"Late Tuesday night New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, or maybe we should call him King Herod, issued a stern warning to Jews in his city. Amid apparent concerns that some of the Chosen People in Gotham weren’t abiding by his strict social distancing orders, he took to Twitter to single them out and threaten them with arrest for their disobedience. It was an act of anti-Semitism vile enough that the mayor should resign."
"Democratic megadonors, including George Soros and Tom Steyer, are putting millions of dollars into efforts to put Hillary Clinton in the White House and win control of the Senate. Their investment comes as Republicans worry about not only their nominee Donald Trump’s chances, but also his effect on down-ballot races.
Yet few of the GOP’s biggest donors have put major money into Trump efforts, a striking change from four years ago when Mitt Romney had more million-dollar donors on his side than did President Barack Obama.

"American parents are in for a payday.
The federal government will begin forking over monthly payments to millions of US families July 15 under President Biden’s controversial expanded child tax credit plan.
The cash — approved as part of the Democrat’s 1.9 trillion stimulus package in March — aims to prevent child poverty.
But critics say the checks, which are part of Biden’s coronavirus relief plan, are an expansion of the welfare state and a disincentive to work.
Here’s what you need to know about the child tax credit, including whether you’re eligible.

"As President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration nears, officials have boosted the number of National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., to 25,000 -- an increase of 25 percent.
Guard members have fanned out across the U.S. Capitol lawn, inside the building and in surrounding areas of D.C. for days. It's an unprecedented security force, deemed necessary in the wake of a deadly riot at the Capitol and continuing threats of domestic terrorism.
At least 7,000 National Guard troops from dozens of states are already on the ground in the nation's..."

"President Joe Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services plans to snub religious freedom this month by eliminating conscience-based objections for healthcare workers, Politico reported on Tuesday.
Former President Donald Trump first announced his intent to introduce conscience-based protections for “physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students, and faith-based charities” in 2018.
By 2019, the HHS Office for Civil Rights crafted a rule that safeguarded nurses, doctors, and others with moral or religious objections to abortion, assisted suicide, sterilization, genital mutilation, and more and emboldened the government to punish institutions that violated it. The..."
"Civilians trapped in the grim battle for control of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol have been allowed to start leaving the city by besieging Russian forces, the United Nations and the Ukrainian government said Sunday.
Invading Russian troops have been trying to oust a stubborn detachment of Ukrainian troops at a vast steel mill complex on the edge of the city, with about a thousand Ukrainian civilians also trapped at the site.
Previous efforts to establish a “humanitarian corridor” to bus out the civilians have repeatedly broken down.

"Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would resume the application renewal process for illegal aliens seeking protection from deportation after being brought into the United States as children. These “Dreamers”, as they are known in some circles, had previously been shielded from deportation under President Barack Obama’s executive order known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA)."
"Every now and then, I start writing a Corner post and never get around to finishing it. Back at the end of May, I started writing a response to John McCormack’s assessment that Amy Klobuchar’s prospects of becoming Joe Biden’s running mate were quickly shrinking. I thought John’s assessment was sound, but that the political environment was frequently changing, and that if Biden thought Klobuchar was the best choice to take over as president and serve as vice president, he might still pick her anyway."
"Tesla CEO Elon Musk filed another notice Monday of his intent to cancel his purchase of social media platform Twitter, citing a whistleblower's recent claims.
Musk's latest attempt to backpedal out of the deal cites revelations found in the ""Zatko complaint"" — a memo released by a former security chief for Twitter that alleged the platform has misused user data and lacks control of the site's core systems.
Musk's camp filed the notice despite claiming it was legally unnecessary due to a previous motion to cancel the purchase. The Aug. 29 filing is..."
"The combined threats of drought conditions, extreme heat, and wildfires led a group of scientists to slap a new label on this summer: ""danger season.""
The name was coined by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental research and advocacy group, in a blog post published earlier this week.
The group noted that summer is the season when the U.S. experiences most of its extreme weather, including heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes, and tropical storms. Existing droughts are exacerbated by hot conditions. And, as the group noted, these threats also “compound one another and cause cascading chains of hazards,”..."

"President Biden on Wednesday changed the federal government's position in a Supreme Court case where former President Donald Trump challenged the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality.
The case, California v. Texas, was argued a week after the 2020 election. Many legal experts predicted that Biden would drop the government's offense on the act soon after he took office. In a letter to the court, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler wrote that the Biden’s Justice Department ""reconsidered"" the facts of the case and now opposes Trump’s position.
The switch comes after Trump,..."
"Israeli officials have decided to block U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from entering the country as part of a planned visit, a reversal that comes amid pressure from President Trump and concerns about their support for boycotts of Israel.
The move prompted a massive outcry from Democratic lawmakers in Washington, but the Israeli government staunchly defended the decision -- suggesting the lawmakers had ulterior motives with the planned trip."
"Senator Joe Manchin declared on Sunday that he is a “no” on President Biden’s Build Back Better bill. Good. The radical legislation that sought to spend trillions of dollars to transform America at a time of historic debt was a bad idea that should never even have made it this far.
After months of back-and-forth negotiations, Manchin said, “I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can’t. I’ve tried everything humanly possible. I can’t get there.” The fact that he made the pronouncement on Fox News Sunday no doubt..."
"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A white police officer who killed a black woman inside her Texas home while responding to a neighbor’s call about an open front door “didn’t have time to perceive a threat” before he opened fire, an attorney for the woman’s family said.
“You didn’t hear the officer shout, ‘Gun, gun, gun,’” attorney Lee Merritt said after viewing video taken from a Fort Worth officer’s bodycam during Saturday’s shooting of Atatiana Jefferson, 28. “He didn’t have time to perceive a threat. That’s murder.”

"The Western world is united in its response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Western countries, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, have imposed a bevy of sanctions expected to hurt the Russian economy.
One such sanction that lately received a great deal of media coverage is the seizure of the assets of Russian oligarchs held in the West. These include luxury villas, yachts, and bank accounts.
In this context, the word “oligarch” is mainly used pejoratively. The word has been in use since the..."
"British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement with the European Union suffered its third successive defeat in Parliament on Friday. That means Britain could still be heading for a no-deal exit from the EU on April 12, a soft Brexit, or no Brexit at all.
The one certain thing is that May's deal is toast. The math just doesn't add up in her favor.
So what happens next? If Parliament votes next week for an alternate approach to Brexit that could earn the EU's favor, May might throw her..."
"Hamas and Israeli officials reportedly were engaged in talks Tuesday -- with Egyptian officials as intermediaries -- that would put in place within hours a cease-fire in their weeklong conflict.
A senior Hamas official told the AP that a truce agreement was within reach, while Reuters quoted an Israeli spokesman who said that while a cease-fire wasn't finalized, the ""ball is still in play.""

"Twitter has exploded in outrage because J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books, is an alleged “TERF.” That’s right, a “trans-exclusionary radical feminist.” This ridiculous slur was invented by people who insist on denying the science of sex and who want to take out their rage on nonbelievers, and on dissenting women in particular.
Prominent male transgender activists such as Charlotte Clymer have gone full hysterical. “For several years, there has been substantial concern that J.K. Rowling is transphobic,” Clymer tweeted, referring, I presume, to the time Rowling..."

"World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that it was “premature” to rule out the possibility that COVID-19 could have emerged from a lab in Wuhan, China, without sufficient evidence.
Walking back on a March WHO report that designated the COVID-19 lab leak theory hypothesis as “extremely unlikely,” Tedros said that based on his experience as a lab technician and immunologist, “lab accidents happen.”
“I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen,” Tedros told reporters. “It’s common.”
In recent months, the theory that the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus was the result of a leak..."
"The head of the World Health Organization said it was “premature” to rule out the possibility that the novel coronavirus leaked from a laboratory, in comments to reporters on Thursday.
The WHO is “asking actually China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for at the early days of the pandemic,” director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference. Tedros said there had been a “premature push” to rule out a lab leak as the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.
“I was..."
"The top US military officer told lawmakers Tuesday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine likely could not have been prevented except by the presence of US forces and warned that the conflict in Europe is likely to drag on for years to come.
Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the conquest of Ukraine had been a “long-standing objective” of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Candidly, short of the commitment of US forces into Ukraine proper, I am not sure he was deterrable,” Milley told the House Armed Services Committee while testifying alongside..."
"The massive Democratic spending package now working its way through Congress is not, strictly speaking, a health care bill. But it's not not a health care bill, either. Many of its biggest, most expensive provisions are expansions of government-run or federally subsidized health care programs. Those provisions represent the largest expansion of federal health care spending since Obamacare.  
And now we have a much better sense of just how big and costly some of those expansions would be. Just two provisions alone would cost about $533 billion, according to a new analysis by the..."

"President Trump boasted about his “very good call” with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin — and slammed his media critics — in a Saturday tweet.
“Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia, despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media,” he posted while motorcading to the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia.
“Look how they have misled you on ‘Russia Collusion,'” he continued. “The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!”

"California governor Gavin Newsom (D.) is strategizing to use the enforcement mechanism of a recently enacted Texas abortion law, which the Supreme Court allowed to survive on Friday, to curb the sale and circulation of “assault weapons” in the state.
On Saturday, Newsom said in a press release that the governor’s office would work with the legislature and attorney general to create a bill that would empower private citizens to sue for at least $10,000 “anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells an assault weapon or ghost gun kit or parts in the State of..."

"Vice President Mike Pence will receive Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine ""publicly"" at the White House on Friday, and President-elect Joe Biden is set to get the shot next week.
The news comes as thousands of Americans are dying from COVID-19 on a daily basis, and officials are seeking to reassure the public that the new vaccine is safe as polls show many people have reservations about the inoculation."
"On the menu today: It’s understandable if you never want to read another word about Covid-19 again, but while the U.S. has the pandemic in its rear-view mirror, the Omicron variant has arrived in China and Hong Kong, and the Chinese government, following its “zero Covid” philosophy, is trying to deal with a super-contagious variant by locking down anyplace it appears. As you can imagine, it’s not going well — and perhaps illustrating that as frustrating and flawed as the U.S. response to Covid-19 was, a “zero covid” approach just..."
"The mainstream media has resorted to shaming and insulting unvaccinated Americans as the ongoing COVID pandemic surges, but medical professionals don’t think the ""substandard"" tactic is appropriate unless the ultimate goal is to further divide the nation. 
A Washington Post columnist on Tuesday praised French President Emmanuel Macron for a series of discouraging remarks he made about the unvaccinated, urging readers globally to make life a ""living hell"" for those who choose to forego the vaccine. The opinion column titled ""Macron is right: It’s time to make life a living hell for anti-vaxxers,"" was the latest example..."
"Republicans across the country are upset with the partys election defeats last week, and many see strategist Karl Rove as a major culprit.
His Crossroads groups raised more than $300 million to defeat President Barack Obama and regain GOP control of the Senate. They failed on both accounts, and many donors to the cause arent too happy.
Some of them are upset that Crossroads had such inaccurate polls, and others say more money should have been spent at the grassroots level rather than on TV advertising, sources tell Politico. Roves..."
"President Biden on Tuesday signed Democrats’ massive spending bill into law, calling it the “biggest step forward on climate ever.”
“With this law, the American people won, and the special interests lost,” Biden said during a signing ceremony at the White House. “For a while people doubted whether any of that was going to happen, but we are in a season of substance.”
He said the bill’s passage is proof for “the American people that democracy still works in America, notwithstanding… all the talk of its demise, not just for..."
"While no one seems to be saying that Ross herself was an evil racist, the fact that she lived—and allegedly sewed the iconic, 13-star flag associated with the American Revolution—during slaveholding times is apparently enough to ensure that she and her flag be canceled.
The controversy comes after Nike announced a new Fourth of July-themed sneaker, made in red, white, and blue materials and adorned on the heel with the Betsy Ross flag. After shipping the shoe—a version of Nike's popular Air Max 1—to stores, the company then abruptly called..."
"Senators drafting a bipartisan immigration bill are considering the creation of a high-tech national identity card to be carried by all workers, whether or not they are U.S. citizens.
The biometric ID card would use fingerprints or other personal markers to establish a persons legal eligibility to work, according to the Wall Street Journal.
In a statement, the bipartisan Senate group called only for workers to prove their legal status and identities through “non-forgeable electronic means.
The lawmakers have not yet decided on the biometric card, although five of the..."

“If necessary, of course, the Russian and American presidents can decide..."

Appearing in the White House briefing room after a week of fruitless negotiations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Meadows accused Democrats of abandoning the American people.

"Fiona Hill, formerly President Trump’s top Russia adviser on the National Security Council, testified that British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier was a “rabbit hole” that “very likely” contained Russian disinformation and that Steele “could have been played” by the Russians.
Hill’s closed-door congressional testimony during Ukraine whistleblower impeachment proceedings from Oct. 14, 2019, was released on Friday, and the 448 pages show that she was upset by much of what she’d seen this year, including efforts by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe and..."

"Before ending his second run for president on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders was a beacon of false hope to those who lack any memory of socialism’s immense human cost.
He helped people believe, for a time, that there is a simple answer to all of life’s problems and that it resides in a powerful central government.
Sanders did one thing further: He also demonstrated that, as radical as it has become, the Democratic Party of 2020 is not as ready for socialism as it once seemed.
In the 19th century,..."

"One of the Oscars last night went to a short film, Two Distant Strangers, about a black guy who keeps getting killed by police, over and over: It was a Black Lives Matter Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day certainly got a workout as a metaphor this past year, didn’t it?

"Joe Biden, you may recall, spent a lot of his time as vice president meddling in the internal affairs of Ukraine. And you may wonder, why Ukraine as opposed to say, Denmark or Senegal or any of the world's other 195 countries. Simple. Because the Ukrainians were paying Joe Biden's family a million dollars a year in exchange for the work that he did. And as president, you may have noticed, Biden has continued to represent Ukrainian interests. Most recently in their dispute with Russia. 
Biden talks constantly about all the scary..."

The report shows “a preponderance of the evidence proves that all roads lead” to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the bat-research lab already eyed as a source for the pandemic, according to Rep. Michael McCaul.
“It is our belief the virus leaked sometime in late August or early September 2019,” said McCaul, the lead Republican..."
"Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, shared new findings from the House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans' probe into the possible origins of COVID-19 on Monday and accused the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of engaging in the ""greatest cover-up in human history.""

"With 90% of the vote in, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16%
is losing Saturday’s Nevada Caucus by a margin of more than 5 points (52.6% to 47.4%). As he musters on with a narrow loss in Iowa and a massive win in New Hampshire, one silver lining is that the 74 year-old socialist won a majority (53%) of Hispanic voters. Among all minorities under 45 years of age, Sanders beat Clinton by a margin of 68% to 28%.
Hillary does better with older voters, and 70% of Nevada’s voters were 45 years-old and up."

Yes, they both ran against Ted Cruz at one point, but that’s not it.

"The Biden administration on Friday announced that it will extend the pause on federal student-loan repayment, interest, and collections until January 31, 2022.
The freeze had been set to expire at the end of September.
“The payment pause has been a lifeline that allowed millions of Americans to focus on their families, health, and finances instead of student loans during the national emergency,” U.S. secretary of education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. “As our nation’s economy continues to recover from a deep hole, this final extension will give students and borrowers..."
"On Friday evening, thousands of New Yorkers attended a memorial service for Rafael Ramos, one of the two NYPD officers assassinated a week ago by an Eric Garner protester.

"Justice Clarence Thomas celebrated his 74th birthday last week with a gift he delivered himself — authoring the majority opinion in a gun rights case that will have nationwide implications.
It was the capstone to a monumental, but splintered term that saw the 6-3 conservative majority prevail on a bounty of hot-button issues and building momentum to a dramatic rightward shift that shows no sign of slowing.
As the senior associate justice and de facto driver of the conservative wing, Thomas this year used his deft leadership in the court:

"The Washington Post's headline calling ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an ""austere religious scholar"" is ""sick and repulsive,"" Fox News host Sean Hannity said Sunday, following the confirmation of his death at the hands of U.S. special forces.
Al-Baghdadi, who took over as the head of ISIS after his predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi was killed in 2010, was said to have detonated a suicide vest as U.S. special forces closed in. Troops were sent to attack a compound in northern Syria where al-Baghdadi was located, according to a U.S. defense..."

The group attempted to take down the doors with a helmet, their feet and a flagpole. A..."
"The influential American Medical Association (AMA) on Wednesday criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) revision of guidelines for quarantine and claimed it is confusing.
Last week, the CDC reduced its recommended quarantine time from 10 days to 5 days for people who have asymptomatic COVID-19. On Tuesday, the agency reaffirmed its decision and said most transmission of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, which causes COVID-19, occurs early on during the infection.

"We'll circle back to the eye-catching CNN poll Katie wrote about earlier, but first, here are the results of a -- shall we say -- questionable online survey of a slew of swing states (and non-swing states), via the Washington Post and Survey Monkey. Some of these numbers would appear more credible if the absence of others."
"Donald Trump argues that Mitt Romney is in no position to be asking for the 2016 Republican frontrunner’s tax returns on the grounds that Romney lost the 2012 general election. Romney is also, Trump wrote, a “dope.”
But Romney is arguably the very best Republican to be asking Trump about his tax returns given how successfully Democrats exploited Romney’s filings to alienate potential voters. Democrats essentially called Romney a tax cheat for his low rate"
"The midterm elections did not go the way many were expecting, and there are several races that have yet to be called.
Many were expecting a red wave on Tuesday night, though it failed to materialize, and the Democrats ended up performing better than expected. However, for many races, the election is ongoing, and the winners of said races may take some time before being declared.
The governor's race for the Grand Canyon State has not yet been called as of Wednesday morning, and Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs has told voters..."
"New Hampshire has just repealed capital punishment, the last of the New England states to do so. Today the state Senate voted to override Gov. Chris Sununu's veto of an anti–death penalty bill. The state House did the same last week, so the legislation will now become law.
Sununu belongs to the GOP, but this effort to end the death penalty was bipartisan. ""Ending New Hampshire's death penalty would not have been possible without significant Republican support,"" says Hannah Cox, national manager of Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty. ""Increasing..."
"Walter Mondale, a Democratic vice president who was beaten by Ronald Reagan in a landslide presidential election in 1984, died at his home in Minneapolis on Monday. He was 93.
A statement from the Mondale family sharing news of Walter Mondale's death did not provide a specific cause.
Mondale was Jimmy Carter's running mate in 1976, beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford and Bob Dole. Hamstrung by a weakened U.S. economy and energy crisis, Carter and Mondale lost reelection in 1980 to Reagan and George H.W. Bush. A U.S. senator for..."
"President Biden is “perfectly comfortable” with cash payouts to migrant families whose members were detained separately after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday.
The answer comes just a day after Biden labeled as “garbage” a report that his administration is considering $450,000-per-person payments.
Jean-Pierre pointedly pivoted Biden’s assessment after the American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday night said Biden “may not have been fully briefed about the actions of his very own Justice Department.”

Prominent measures include a federal ban on no-knock warrants and chokeholds, limits on qualified immunity shielding police from civil lawsuits, a framework to prevent racial profiling and the establishment of a national..."
"Iraqi militants seized control Thursday of the country's largest Christian city -- reportedly telling its residents to leave, convert or die -- while members of another religious minority remained trapped on a mountain without enough food or water, circumstances that fueled calls for the U.S. and U.N. to get more involved.
In response, Pentagon officials told Fox News the administration is considering humanitarian aid drops for the families stuck on the mountain in northern Iraq, and noted they have been ""urgently and directly"" working with officials to coordinate Iraqi..."

"Chinese dictator Xi Jinping called for China to create a world-class military as he declared supremacy over Hong Kong and set his sights on Taiwan on Sunday.
Xi made the comments during his opening address to the Chinese Community Party Congress in Beijing. Xi spoke before 2,300 CPP delegates who will later vote to grant him an unprecedented third term as China's president and general secretary of the CCP. The leader laid out ambitions for China, declaring a determination to beef up the country's military and take over Taiwan.

"As the news of a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday continues to travel far and wide, faith leaders across the nation are sharing their reactions, prayers, words and insights with Fox News Digital.
They're also calling out moral rot when they see it.
A suspected lone gunman took the lives of at least 19 children and two teachers; the gunman has been killed, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on Tuesday. 
""Texans across the state are grieving for the victims of this senseless crime and for the community of..."
"The New York Times editorial board announced Sunday evening that it would endorse two candidates for president for the first time in the newspaper’s history: Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received the paper’s support.
The Times’s editorial board interviewed nine of the top candidates last month for in-depth interviews and documented the process of how they settled on the double endorsement in the paper’s documentary show “The Weekly” on FX.
The paper’s endorsement of Warren, senator from Massachusetts, and Klobuchar, senator from Minnesota, comes just..."
"The U.S. and Russia have carried out a prisoner swap Wednesday, exchanging Trevor Reed – a Marine veteran jailed in Moscow – for a Russian drug trafficker who has been serving time in America, a senior U.S. official told the Associated Press. 
The deal comes as tensions between U.S. and Russia are running high, with Moscow's bloody invasion of Ukraine in its 63rd day. 
""Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly. Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention,"" President Biden said..."
"On Thursday night in Philadelphia, Joe Biden used his presidential perch, flanked by two United States Marines, to give one of the most menacing and divisive campaign speeches in recent memory.
In his soul-crushing ""soul of the nation"" speech, the president threw half the country back into Hillary Clinton’s basket of deplorables. Anyone who refuses to go along with his radical agenda that’s bankrupting the country is a threat. Anyone who stands up for religious liberty is an extremist. Anyone who is a voice for voiceless and vulnerable unborn babies..."
"President Joe Biden last night used the backdrop of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to accuse his political opponents of betraying American democracy. The complaints from GOP leaders are loud. How dare Biden use this birthplace of the republic to speak that way about former President Donald Trump and his tens of millions of supporters?
During his presidency, Trump repeatedly used places of national memory for partisan purposes. He gave a slashing partisan interview to Fox News from the Lincoln Memorial. At Mount Rushmore, he denounced “a new far-left fascism” that seeks “to wipe out our history,..."
"Senate Republicans on Tuesday are poised to keep the majority in 2021, defying polls that indicated Democrats could defeat a slew of incumbent GOP lawmakers and win back the gavel they lost in 2014.
Democrats needed to pick up four seats to regain the majority but are on track so far for a net gain of just one seat. They have so far defeated only two Republican incumbents and were on track to lose up to two of their own seats."
"Voters are seven weeks away from casting their ballots in the midterm elections, but House Republicans already have their sights set on what they want to achieve if they manage to recapture the House.
After weeks of weathering stiff criticism from Democrats for being tight-lipped with a comprehensive legislative agenda, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy unveiled the “Commitment to America"" agenda, laying out the broad strokes of what Republicans want to do.
Here is a look at some of the objectives McCarthy rolled out."
"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and his staff told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D, N.Y., unequivocally Thursday that he is only willing to support a reconciliation bill in August that includes a provision to lower prescription drug prices and a two-year extension of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversations. 
Manchin was explicit that he won't support a bill before the midterms with any provisions on energy and climate or closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy and biggest corporations, despite his support for those..."
"On Saturday, reports began flowing out of Syria that their own government allegedly had used chemical attacks on civilians which killed dozens of men, women, and children. It was unknown what the response from the United States would be, but today President Donald J. Trump made clear that he is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Iranian government for supporting ""Animal Assad."""
"The U.S. has reached a deal to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, removing a major barrier to congressional approval of President Trump’s revised trade deal with the countries.
The U.S. will be “selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs or major tariffs — big difference,” Mr. Trump announced in a speech Friday afternoon before the National Association of Realtors.
The president said the U.S. has a great relationship with Canada but that it put up a “barrier” by imposing tariffs..."
"Inflation rose to a 6.6% annual rate in March in the personal consumption expenditures price index, the metric favored by the Federal Reserve, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Friday.
That is 0.3 percentage points higher than in the previous month and the fastest pace of inflation since January 1982.
The report is evidence that inflation is still accelerating, unwelcome news both for families stretched to afford basics and for President Joe Biden, whose popularity has been greatly damaged by the rising prices.
Friday’s report will not lessen the urgency within the Fed..."
"Even border-crossers are too scared of the crime-riddled Big Apple.
Mayor Adams was on hand for the cameras Sunday to greet the city’s latest busload of migrants being dumped here from Texas — only to be stunned to learn that the vast majority had  gotten off before they made it.
Hizzoner said the immigrants likely bailed out early  because of their “fear” of the city.
“We were led to believe about 40 people should have been on that bus. Only 14 got off,” Adams said at a 7 a.m. press..."

"So Dr. Anthony Fauci in the pandemic’s early months was casting doubt on the lab-leak theory of COVID’s origins — even as he was also receiving at least one alert from a genomic researcher that “some of the features look (potentially) engineered.” 
Notably, he forwarded “anti-conspiracy theory” articles that quoted Peter Daszak — the head of a US nonprofit that used some grant money from Fauci’s agency to fund coronavirus work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — ­attacking the lab-leak idea. Daszak and others wrote Fauci personally to thank him for..."
"A few months after Hillary Clinton took over as U.S. secretary of state in 2009, a longtime associate with connections to the Clinton Foundation insisted that her senior aides give a job to an unidentified male associate.
“Important to take care of [name redacted],” Douglas Band, President Bill Clinton’s former right-hand man, wrote to Clinton aides Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and Nora Toiv in an April 22, 2009, email.
“We have all had him on our radar,” Abedin responded. “Personnel has been sending him options.”"
"A federal judge in Florida overturned the Biden administration’s national transportation mask mandate on Monday, determining that the CDC overstepped its authority by requiring masks on planes, trains, buses, and other forms of public transportation.
The order handed down by U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle holds that the CDC’s masking requirement violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was implemented “without allowing public participation through the APA’s notice and comment procedures.”
Mizelle, who was appointed by former president Donald Trump in 2020, found that the mandate is full of contradictions and lacks specificity...."
"The IRS takes a $300 million cut and the EPA’s staffing is reduced to levels not seen since the 1980s under the $1.1 trillion spending bill written by congressional negotiators, and which GOP leaders are pleading with their members to support ahead of key showdown votes this week.
House leaders hope those moves will keep Republicans in line behind the spending bill, which makes some dents in programs the GOP wanted to target, but does not cancel President Obama’s temporary deportation amnesty, instead pushing that fight into next year."
"A few folks, like the usually astute Quin Hillyer, argue that if Liz Cheney wants to run for president in 2024, she must do so as an independent. I concur that there is no realistic path to Cheney getting the GOP nomination against Trump, either in a one-on-one race, or in a multi-candidate field that included someone like Florida governor Ron DeSantis. (If you’re getting blown out in a one-on-one GOP primary in Wyoming, you’re not gonna win the GOP presidential nomination. Maybe, if you’re lucky, you get a respectable finish..."
"Former President Donald Trump has targeted Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for nearly a year and a half.
And on the eve of the Peach State’s primary – with Trump backing Kemp challenger former Sen. David Perdue – the former president took aim at the governor one last time before voters headed to the polls.
""Brian Kemp is truly an embarrassment to the Republican Party because of what's taken place in your great state, Georgia,"" Trump charged during a tele-rally Monday evening on behalf of Perdue. ""And David will make a massive upgrade as..."
"The personal details of US military commanders and thousands of prominent Americans have been amassed since 2017 by a Chinese technology company with reported ties to the country’s military and intelligence networks, according to a report on leaked data.
A database of about 2.4 million people, including at least 50,000 Americans, was compiled by the small Chinese company called Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Technology, the Washington Post reported.
The massive trove — called the Overseas Key Information Database, or OKIDB — includes biographies and service records of the US military commanders,..."
"Activists decided it would be a good idea to delay one of the most notable NCAA Football Championship Subdivision football games of the year to make a political statement.
The Yale Bulldogs hosted the Harvard Crimson on Saturday and beat them 50-43 in double overtime, but that's not why the game made headlines. At halftime, left-wing activists took the field and refused to leave when the second half was supposed to start.
The protesters demanded that the two schools divest from their fossil fuel investments and cancel their holdings of..."
"COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the United States are declining, a sign that the vaccination campaign is succeeding and the spring surge has ended.
In the past two weeks, new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have dropped from a seven-day average of 78,449 to 51,465, a decline of 34%. New hospitalizations have also fallen 34%, from 3,165 to 2,083.
Over 55% of adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 39% have been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
"The Federal Reserve imposed the latest in a series of sharp interest rate hikes on Wednesday in a sign that policymakers aren’t backing down from an aggressive campaign to lower decades-high inflation.
The rate-making Federal Open Market Committee hiked the benchmark interest rate by 0.75%, or 75 basis points, at the end of a two-day meeting. The latest increase moved the Fed’s target range to between 3% and 3.25%.
In a statement after the meeting, the FOMC said it “anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate”..."
"On Election Day 2016, at precisely 10:41 a.m., wunder pollster Nate Silver posted a story on his website FiveThirtyEight.
“Final Election Update: There’s A Wide Range Of Outcomes, And Most Of Them Come Up Clinton,” read the headline.
Silver said his “forecast has Clinton favored in states and congressional districts totaling 323 electoral votes, including all the states President Obama won in 2012 except Ohio and Iowa, but adding North Carolina.” He hedged his bet a bit, though, saying Clinton could lose North Carolina or Florida, so “the average number..."
"Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz will told lawmakers Wednesday the FBI’s investigation into alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign was a failure by the bureau’s “entire chain of command.”
Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Horowitz said the FBI’s application to monitor a Trump campaign aide was riddled with errors and omissions, and the brass should have better managed the agents.
“It is incumbent upon the entire chain of command, including senior officials to take the necessary steps to ensure that they are sufficiently familiar..."
"British Prime Minister Liz Truss may be ousted six weeks into her tenure after she and fellow ministers caved on most portions of an aggressive economic reform package.
Truss, who replaced outgoing head of government and fellow Conservative Party member Boris Johnson last month, unveiled a tax cut and energy production plan in the first days of her premiership. After investors concerned about the government’s ability to meet debt obligations jettisoned their assets, Truss announced that she would eliminate portions of her plan and dismissed finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng.
“We need to act now to..."
"Former President Donald Trump expressed concern Thursday for Americans forced to pay sky-high gas prices as millions hit the road for the Memorial Day holiday.
“With Memorial Day Weekend coming up, tomorrow people start driving in the biggest automobile days of the year,” Trump said in an emailed statement.
“I’m sorry to say the gasoline prices that you will be confronted with are far higher than they were just a short number of months ago where we had gasoline under $2 a gallon.”
According to AAA, travelers will face the highest prices at the pump..."
"Anxiety over COVID-19 might be an unhappy side effect of getting vaccinated against the disease.
I'm kidding, but you could be forgiven for drawing that tongue-in-cheek conclusion from a new Morning Consult/New York Times poll showing that vaccinated (and boosted) Americans are about twice as likely to say they are ""very"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about ""getting sick from COVID-19 within the next year.""
That is, of course, the exact opposite of what the actual science tells us. Even during the tremendous surge in COVID cases caused by the omicron variant, vaccinated individuals..."
"Democrats have a message for Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has said the GOP will “tattoo” Obamacare to Democrats’ foreheads in the 2014 midterm elections.
Bring it on.
In a memo issued Thursday afternoon, Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee touted the law’s benefits, such as provisions that bar insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and allow young people to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until they are 26."
"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) reportedly has been working for months to generate bipartisan support in his chamber for repealing the federal ban on marijuana. If so, there is little evidence of that effort in the draft legislation that he unveiled today, which is larded with new taxes, regulations, and spending programs that seem designed to alienate Republicans who might be inclined to support a cleaner bill on federalist grounds.
Schumer is presenting the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, which is also backed by Sens. Cory Booker (D–N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D–Ore.), as a..."
"For all the talk of a deep Republican bench for 2016, a lot of the faces in the early game are the same.
Mitt Romney? Really? He ran and lost in 2012 — badly. Rick Santorum? Mike Huckabee? Rick Perry? They all ran and lost to the guy who won the nomination — and then lost — badly. Sarah Palin? She lost so badly in 2008 she didn’t even make an effort in 2012. The list of has-beens goes on and on."
"Voters won’t immediately know the results of the 2022 midterm elections , with some of the most consequential races not expected to be called for days — maybe even weeks.
The fate of both the House and Senate for the next two years will be decided after the polls close on Tuesday. However, a number of factors could delay how long until voters and candidates know the results of their races, especially for those in key battleground states that are set to determine which party will gain control of Congress."
"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican trying to gain traction in a crowded 2016 presidential field, on Tuesday proposed a major overhaul of the popular Social Security program for older Americans that would cut benefits for wealthy people.
At a New Hampshire appearance later on Tuesday, Christie plans to propose Social Security ""means-testing"" that would reduce the size of benefits for people earning more than $80,000 annually and phase them out entirely for those earning $200,000 or more.
""Do we really believe that the wealthiest Americans need to..."
"Two men with ties to President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and who are believed to be natives of former Soviet republics will appear in federal court in Virginia Thursday on campaign finance charges.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Florida businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested Wednesday. Giuliani, the lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in May he was representing both men.
A spokesman for he Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office confirmed the arrests to Reuters.
Details of the charges were not immediately known but they have..."
"Her colleagues are rushing to condemn her on the House floor this week, but Representative Ilhan Omar has her backers among powerful progressive activist groups who say they don’t understand why Democratic leaders are going out of their way to cut down one of their own.
A draft resolution slated for a vote Wednesday doesn’t name Ms. Omar, but it condemns anti-Semitism as “hateful expressions of intolerance” and would come just days after the Minnesota congresswoman suggested other lawmakers show too much fealty to Israel.
She says her words are..."
"You’re going to hear a lot of hot takes about Chamath Palihapitiya and his comments about the Uyghurs in China this week. Amid the resulting firestorm, Palihapitiya issued a brief statement declaring he recognizes he “came across as lacking empathy . . . My belief is that human rights matter, whether in China, or the United States, or elsewhere. Full stop.”
No, that isn’t his belief. This is damage-control public relations. He specifically said in this conversation that if he said he cared, he was lying. He said the “hard truth” is..."
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrived Monday on Capitol Hill contrite and apologetic, ahead of an expected grilling later this week before Congress -- and the threat of regulations -- after the social media giant allowed a data-mining company to get the personal information from at least 87 million users."
"The Department of Justice unveiled seditious conspiracy charges against 11 defendants, including the founder and leader of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia group, Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, for their role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
On Jan. 6, 2021, after then-President Trump had repeatedly claimed that the 2020 election had been stolen from him, thousands of his supporters left his rally at Freedom Plaza near the White House and headed toward the Capitol. Lawmakers evacuated the complex and temporarily suspended the certification of the Electoral College results as..."
"Mark Zuckerberg clearly hasn’t gotten the memo.
The founder of Facebook persists in defending free expression, even though free speech has fallen decidedly out of fashion.
His reward for adhering to what once would have been a commonsensical, if not banal, view of the value of the free exchange of ideas is to get vilified for running a hate-speech machine and to get boycotted by major American companies.
In a speech at Georgetown University last fall, Zuckerberg stated that it’s important “we hold each other’s right to express our views..."
"Confusion reigned at Budapest's main railway station Thursday morning after Hungarian police allowed hundreds of migrants to enter the building, but the country's railway operator said that no direct trains would depart for Western Europe, the intended destination for many refugees.
A Reuters photographer estimated that up to 1,000 migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia had poured into the Keleti railway station from the square outside. The photographer also reported that some people had stormed the first trains they could find and were trying to push themselves..."
"New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill on Thursday allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, making the Garden State the 14th state in the country, along with the District of Columbia, to enact such a measure.
""Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all,"" Murphy said.
Murphy, a Democrat, signed the bill after it was approved by the Democratic majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate, during their final..."
"On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., and politely ordered coffee. White waitresses ignored them because the store had a policy of not serving African-Americans.
The incident sparked massive protests across the nation involving sit-ins by black people at Woolworth lunch counters, leading the chain to finally desegregate that July and boosting the civil rights movement.
This week, on the Fourth of July, the Officers Association in Tempe, Ariz., says six police officers were drinking coffee at a Starbucks..."
"Federal investigators are weighing whether to charge Hunter Biden with various tax and foreign lobbying violations, false statements and more, with a former official telling Fox News that an outcome to the case could be ""imminent.""
Fox News first reported in July that the federal investigation into President Biden’s son had reached a ""critical stage."" Hunter Biden has been under federal investigation since 2018.
The investigation is being conducted by Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a prosecutor appointed by former President Donald Trump."
"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman has been fired from the National Security Council and escorted out of the White House.
“Today, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted out of the White House where he has dutifully served his country and his President. He does so having spoken publicly once, and only pursuant to a subpoena from the United States Congress,"" Vindman's attorney released in a statement.
Vindman's ousting comes as part of a restructuring of the NSC, which has been in the works for months.
Last year Vindman testified..."
"The World Bank cut its global growth forecasts for 2022 on Tuesday and warned of the “sharpest slowdown in 80 years.”
In January, the international financial institution forecasted 4.1% economic growth for this year. In light of elevated inflation, lockdowns in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and other phenomena, the World Bank revised its 2022 forecast to 2.9%."
"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Tuesday pledged not to make any changes to equipment or overtime at the US Postal Service until after the election.
DeJoy is poised to testify Friday before a Senate committee and on Monday before a House committee about cutbacks to services and machinery ahead of an anticipated deluge of mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“The Postal Service is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall,” DeJoy said in a statement."
"Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says it's ""just not worth it"" to attempt to impeach President Donald Trump.
She told the Washington Post, ""Unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country.""
Still, Pelosi doesn't think Trump deserves to be president. ""Are we talking ethically? Intellectually? Politically? What are we talking here?"" she said. ""All of the above. No. No. I don't think he is... I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise..."
"The problem-plagued ObamaCare website shut down Saturday night for “extended” repairs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Technicians have shut down HealthCare.gov during weekends since the site launched Oct. 1 but just for a few overnight hours.
The site was scheduled to be offline from 9 p.m. ET Saturday until 9 a.m. Sunday.
""The HealthCare.gov tech team is performing extended maintenance this weekend to improve network infrastructure and make enhancements to the online application and enrollment tools,” agency spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Saturday."
"A top conservative radio host whose adamant support of President Trump helped galvanize his election in 2016 scored a virtual visit from the commander in chief himself.
On his radio show Thursday afternoon, Rush Limbaugh said Trump will join him on the airwaves Friday as part of a ""virtual rally.""
“I’m thrilled to announce that our commander in chief, President Donald Trump, will be right here tomorrow hosting the largest virtual rally in radio history,” Limbaugh said during his show on Thursday. “It will be special, and I am really..."
"I have a great lead-in for my radio show today on most of my stations, including WRKO. Donald J. Trump. Everybody needs guest hosts occasionally. And sometimes, when you’re breaking in a replacement, you wonder if he’s going to be up to the task of carrying a show for three or four hours, hitting the hard breaks, taking just enough callers but not too many, etc. But Rush Limbaugh’s got nothing to worry about today. President Trump doesn’t even need to take a call. He could talk a dog off..."
"The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called Monday for “urgent action” in its latest report, prodding countries to hasten emissions reductions even as events in Ukraine threaten to submerge the global-warming agenda.
The IPCC Working Group II report said that climate change is running ahead of global adaptation efforts, creating “dangerous and widespread disruption in nature” that could be irreversible unless action is taken quickly.
“This report is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction,” said IPCC chair Hoesung Lee in a statement. “It shows that climate change is a grave..."
"U.S. citizens evacuated from Afghanistan by the United States will not be charged for repatriation flights, the State Department clarified, amid reports that some were asked to pay $2,000 or more.
“In these unique circumstances, we have no intention of seeking any reimbursement from those fleeing Afghanistan,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told several media outlets on Thursday.
The U.S. embassy in Afghanistan had previously said it would seek reimbursement for the cost of evacuation flights from those seeking evacuation assistance once they were safely out of the country.
The Overseas Security..."
"President Joe Biden attempted to walk back his divisive rhetoric delivered Thursday night, when the commander-in-chief stood before Independence Hall flanked by Marines illuminated by blood-red lights like stormtroopers.
Two months before the November midterms, Biden went on a 25-minute tirade in which he branded his political opposition as an existential threat to democracy and the “soul of this nation.”
“Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic,” Biden said. “There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven,..."
"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended Friday’s press gaggle, which restricted the number of journalists present.
According to an audio recording of the briefing circulated by the pool, when Spicer was asked whether he was playing favorites by excluding outlets such as The New York Times, CNN, BBC, and the Los Angeles Times, among others, he said he “disagreed with the premise of the question,” but added that the White House had “shown an abundance of accessibility.”"
"The White House National Security Council is disputing a ''completely false'' claim from a Ukrainian official to CNN that President Joe Biden has warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the inevitability of a Russian invasion.
After an official asserted that Biden warned of Kyiv being potentially ''sacked'' and said Ukraine should ''prepare for impact'' once the ground freezes, White House NSC spokeswoman Emily Horne tweeted a pointed objection to the readout of the call between leaders.
''This is not true,'' Horne tweeted. ''President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the..."
"The Supreme Court temporarily suspended the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers on Thursday, but allowed the administration’s vaccine mandate for health-care workers at facilities that receive federal funding to go into effect.
In the first case, the conservative majority on the bench ruled in a 6-3 vote to block President Biden’s vaccine requirement for private businesses pending further review by the court. Biden had argued that the order derived authority from the 1971 Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), which empowered the federal government to regulate workplace health and safety standards.
However,..."
"A group of Democratic lawmakers reintroduced legislation on Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 — and indicated they may use a powerful procedural tool to pass the bill using their slimmest-possible Senate majority.
“Let’s be clear: The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said during a call with reporters. ""No person in America can make it on $8, $10 or $12 an hour."""
"Viewership for the Olympics is down (way down) from 2018, to an audience for the 2022 opening ceremonies that was 43 percent smaller than that which watched the winter games in 2018. But that still leaves millions of Americans choosing to watch the international contest, which is fine. Unlike the situation in many other countries, U.S. Olympic teams are supported by those who spend of their own accord, so everybody is free to glue themselves to the screen, to tune in on occasion, or to totally ignore the event without being compelled to..."
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is still using a strict present-tense “not running” as her answer to questions about her possible presidential ambitions. But that seems increasingly likely to change given the overwhelmingly positive (and generally overwhelming) coverage of her bid to harass the White House and Senate leaders over Wall Street carve outs stuffed in a fiscal-cliff spending bill. The Daily Beast called her the “most powerful Democrat in America.” The WaPo warned Warren’s moves may force 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton to alter her plans. And Warren got star treatment..."
"In an unexpected tweet on Thursday afternoon, President Trump announced that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving her post at the end of June. Who should replace her?
Well, here are four Trump supporters who would bring very different styles to the Brady Room's podium.
First off, in the MAGA devotee category: Sebastian Gorka. With a penchant for rather hyperbolic support of the president, and rather hyperbolic disdain for Trump's opponents, Gorka would obviously bring a smile to the president's face. It is far less certain..."
"Judge Jed Rakoff struck a blow to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s defamation lawsuit against The New York Times on Feb. 14 when he ruled in favor of a motion by the defense that essentially nullifies a jury’s verdict in her favor should it come back with one.
Officially known as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure No. 50, or the “Rule 50 Motion,” the motion states that the plaintiff has to have sufficient evidence for every element it needs to prove.
In this case, the element in question is “actual malice.” Proving this..."
"After a disagreeable phone call with Speaker John A. Boehner on the budget impasse, President Obama Saturday accused House Republicans of trying to “plunge this country back into a recession” in their battle with the president over Obamacare.
In his weekly address, Mr. Obama blamed the gridlock on “a faction on the far right of the Republican party who’ve convinced their leadership to threaten a government shutdown if they can’t shut off the Affordable Care Act.”"
"President Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to joke about his cameo being cut from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s version of ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.""
“I guess Justin T doesn’t much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade!,” Trump tweeted, referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau."
"There’s no prescribed way to celebrate July 4th. And that’s the best part of it.
Donald Trump is recruiting some Abrams tanks and obsessing about some of the choreography for an Independence Day parade in Washington D.C. He wants it to be militaristic, bombastic, and he wants to be at the center of it. I couldn’t care less. And, I wonder why anyone else does.
I can’t remember ever paying attention to how this day was celebrated in the capital city. In recent years I’ve taken my kids to..."
"Campaigning in his home state, Mitt Romney cracked an out-of-the-ordinary joke Friday about the so-called ""birther"" controversy.
While talking up his roots in Michigan -- both he and his wife Ann were born and raised here, and his father was a much-beloved governor -- Romney noted the proof behind his place of birth.
""Ann was born in Henry Ford Hospital. I was born in Harper Hospital,"" he said to cheers from a crowd of several thousand at a local orchard and cider mill, before joking about the questions..."
"A bipartisan group of ten senators reached a deal on an infrastructure plan on Thursday to present to the Biden administration for further negotiations.
The plan includes about $579 billion in new spending and, including expected future spending, would cost $974 billion over five years or $1.2 trillion over eight years, multiple outlets reported. The ten senators said there would be no tax increases. 
“Our group — comprised of 10 Senators, 5 from each party — has worked in good faith and reached a bipartisan agreement on a realistic, compromise framework to modernize..."
"Nick Ayers, in talks with President Donald Trump to become his new White House chief of staff, is a 36-year-old political whiz-kid who could help with the looming re-election campaign, but critics question whether he has the grit needed to keep Trump and an often chaotic administration under control."
"City officials in Ferguson, Mo. were due Sunday to address the resignation of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed teenager Michael Brown in a confrontation in August that fueled protests in the St. Louis suburb and around the nation.
Stephanie Karr, Ferguson city attorney, told the Associated Press that city officials planned to make a statement regarding Wilson's resignation. Karr earlier this week said Wilson had been on paid leave pending the outcome of an internal police investigation.
Wilson's resignation was announced Saturday by one of his..."
"In his address to the nation this morning, Donald Trump asserted that the ballistic missiles that targeted the al-Assad and Erbil bases in Iraq yesterday were paid for using “funds made available by the last administration.” Few things irritate media fact checkers more than Trump’s accusation that Obama helped fund the Iranian regime and its terror apparatus. Probably because it’s completely true.
Now, we don’t really know that Obama’s ransom payments to Iran in 2016 subsidized those specific ballistic missiles, but we do know that money is fungible — especially..."
"The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status, a top IRS official said Friday. Organizations were singled out because they included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, said Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups. In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, which violates IRS policy in most cases, she said."
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions could face heat from both sides of the aisle Tuesday, in a widely anticipated appearance before House lawmakers that comes just hours after he revealed that he has ordered top prosecutors to look into ""certain issues"" involving the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of American uranium interests to Russia."
"Parents should have the option to vaccinate their children when a vaccine becomes available. This is especially true for parents of kids with pre-existing medical conditions, including obesity. 
As highlighted in a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a real-world analysis of COVID-19 hospitalizations among adolescents aged 12–18 years showed 72 percent of those hospitalized had at least one underlying pre-existing medical condition. Of the hospitalized, 97 percent were unvaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccinating high-risk adolescents.
Late Friday evening, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the..."
"July 4 is an appropriate time to remember Frederick Douglass' famous 1852 speech, ""What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?"" The speech is—for good reason—most famous for its powerful condemnation of slavery, racism, and American hypocrisy. But it also includes passages praising the American Revolution and the Founding Fathers. Both are worth remembering."
"The California jury in the criminal fraud case against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has found her guilty on four of 11 charges on its seventh day of deliberation to determine Holmes' fate.
The panel composed of eight men and four women convicted Holmes on one charge of conspiracy and three charges of fraud. They determined she was not guilty of a second conspiracy charge and not guilty on three fraud charges. They were unable to reach a unanimous decision on another three fraud charges. 
Holmes, 37, was charged by federal prosecutors with nine counts..."
"Former President Donald Trump’s legal team has elevated its legal battle to the Supreme Court, requesting that Justice Clarence Thomas, who has jurisdiction over the 11th Circuit, vacate the stay by the court that allowed the Justice Department to continue its review of classified documents seized during the FBI’s unprecedented raid of Mar-a-Lago. 
U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon issued an injunction against the DOJ's use of the 100 documents purportedly marked as classified to be used for investigative purposes.
The 11th Circuit overturned Cannon's order and prevented court-appointed Special Master..."
"The Supreme Court delivered a dramatic change to abortion jurisprudence in a Mississippi abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, by overturning Roe v. Wade.
A leaked February draft opinion indicated that the court may move in that direction. The final opinion was released Friday, June 24. 
Overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that limited government restrictions on abortion, will allow states to change access to abortion, allowing state legislatures to pass laws banning abortions prior to fetal viability. Blue states, however, are looking to expand access to abortion.
How..."
"When the Department of Commerce announced on Thursday that the advanced estimate for second-quarter GDP growth came in with a bone-chilling 32.9% decline on an annualized basis, Congress was debating the details of another multitrillion-dollar relief package for America’s beleaguered, coronavirus-fatigued population. An extended federal supplement for the more than 20 million unemployed people, along with perhaps another round of cash payments for families, will almost surely be finalized before Congress goes on recess.
But while our legislators deliberate and the coronavirus surges, GDP growth (which until the pandemic was..."
"A heat wave over Labor Day weekend that fueled new wildfires across California has pushed the state to set a new record for the number of acres burned, as dramatic evacuations continue for one blaze called an ""unprecedented disaster.""
As of Monday, wildfires have scorched over 2 million acres of land in the Golden State. Crews were conducting active rescue operations to save people surrounded by the flames.
“It’s a little unnerving because September and October are historically our worst months for fires,” Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff told The..."
"When E. F. Hutton speaks, people listen. When William Barr speaks, call an electrician.
Mental circuits trip and temperament fuses blow. The attorney general, bucking the behavior of attorneys generally, displays all the emotion of a mortician, approaches an audience with the calm detachment of a psychiatrist, and speaks in the reading-room volume of a librarian. His bearing rarely proves contagious.
“The person in the white coat is not the grand seer who can come up with the right decision for society. A free people makes its decision through its..."
"Counselor to President Donald Trump Kellyanne Conway criticized some on the left for immediately politicizing the deadly church shooting in Texas.
At least 26 people were killed and approximately 20 more were wounded after a gunman opened fire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday.
In the wake of the attack, many Democrat lawmakers and Hollywood celebrities called for gun control."
"The torrid pace of inflation slowed in July for the first time in months, but prices remained near the highest level in 40 years.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, below the 9.1% year-over-year surge recorded in June. Prices were unchanged in the one-month period from June.
Those figures were both lower than the 8.7% headline figure and 0.2% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv..."
"Vice President Kamala Harris made an unforced error of global proportions Thursday by touting the strong alliance between the United States and “the Republic of North Korea” during a visit to the Korean Demilitarized Zone.
“The United States shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the Republic of North Korea,” said the veep, flubbing the official name of longstanding US ally South Korea, the Republic of Korea. “And it is an alliance that is strong and enduring.”
The gaffe was the latest foreign policy-related blunder by Harris, who..."
"Three Florida-based fundraisers quit Jeb Bush's presidential campaign on Friday, with inside sources saying personality conflicts and other internal issues led to the decision.
Kris Money, Trey McCarley, and Debbie Alexander said they quit voluntarily, but will remain with Bush's Right to Rise super PAC, reports Politico. However, other sources reported that the three had been let go because they were no longer needed with the campaign.
Bush spokesman Tim Miller commented that longtime aide Ann Herberger will continue to lead the"
"Did the Republican National Convention give Mitt Romney a poll bounce? Yes, it seems, but a small one. Before things kicked off in Tampa, Joel Pollak warned Romney supporters not to expect much of a post-convention bump. His admonition has been partially vindicated. Liberal electoral stats maven Nate Silver says evidence of a lasting poll surge is scant, but that assessment depends on what survey you're looking at. Gallup's weekend numbers showed Obama's job approval dropping and his disapproval on the rise, but the overall race remains deadlocked. Reuters' tracker..."
"President Trump, in an exclusive interview Friday morning with “Fox & Friends,” said he will not fire adviser Kellyanne Conway in the wake of a government watchdog’s recommendation that she be removed over violations of the Hatch Act.
“I’m not gonna fire her. I think she’s a terrific person. She’s a tremendous spokesperson,” Trump said.
The Hatch Act limits certain political activities of federal employees. In an explosive report released a day earlier, the Office of Special Counsel (which is separate from the office with a similar name previously run..."
"House Democratic leaders are urging their colleagues to tone down the impeachment rhetoric as it relates to President Donald Trump.
During a Monday evening conference call, high-ranking party leaders tried to squash talk of pursuing impeachment at this time.
According to The Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others expressed their concern over jumping on the impeachment bandwagon without concrete evidence Trump might have committed an impeachable offense.
""We need to hear from [Attorney General William] Barr and [special counsel Robert] Mueller – and we need to see the unredacted..."
"I’ve been asked the same question at least a hundred times in the past week: If the president loses, will he participate in a peaceful transition of power?
The question probably says as much about those asking it as the answer does about President Trump. Most of the inquirers are the same people who still don’t understand why nearly half the country voted for Mr. Trump. They still wonder if he somehow cheated his way into office. They still think he should’ve been impeached, believe the polls, and consider the..."
"The centerpiece of Joe Biden's domestic agenda, the $2 trillion ""Build Back Better"" spending package, has been dealt a possibly fatal blow by a fellow Democrat, who calls it bad for America. 
West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said Sunday he just can't vote for it. ""I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there,"" Manchin announced on Fox News Sunday, ""This is a 'no'."" 
Manchin said he opposes the expensive package that Republicans have called a welfare goody bag..."
"A key inflation gauge that revealed consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in decades last month could prompt the Federal Reserve to start laying the groundwork to begin curtailing its massive monetary support to the U.S. economy.
The Labor Department announced Thursday that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged 5% in May from a year prior, the fastest year-over-year jump since 2008. Excluding the volatile food and energy data, core inflation rose 3.8% from a year earlier, the quickest since June 1992. 
The data could have significant implications for the U.S. Central..."
"Ukraine’s government announced Thursday that police are investigating whether ousted U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was subject to illegal surveillance, in response to new documents released ahead of President Trump’s impeachment trial.
Those documents, released by Democratic lawmakers, showed Lev Parnas -- an associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani -- communicating about the removal of Marie Yovanovitch as the ambassador to Ukraine.
In some of those communications, Trump donor Robert F. Hyde seemed to indicate intimate knowledge of Yovanovitch’s activities – claiming at one point her phone and computer were off,..."
National Rifle Association executive vice president and CEO Wayne LaPierre struck a defiant tone during an address Friday morning at the Conservative Political Action Conference saying that advocates of the Second Amendment will never back down despite the elitists who constantly denigrate and mock them.
"President Donald Trump sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday morning in his continued attempt to discredit the whistleblower behind the complaint that led to the House’s impeachment inquiry.
“The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,” Trump wrote. “He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist?""
The president also pressed ahead with his insistence that there was nothing wrong in his July telephone call with..."
"The Supreme Court Tuesday upheld an Indiana law that governs how hospitals and abortion clinics can dispose of fetal remains, ruling the state does have a valid interest in that matter.
But the justices declined to hear a challenge involving the state’s law banning abortions when the decision is based on race, gender or diagnosed disability such as Down syndrome.
A lower appeals court had struck down that law as an infringement on abortion rights. The court said it wanted to wait for other cases to bubble up before granting..."
"Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, declared last night, “only Democrats will protect our freedoms. That is now the central choice in the 2022 election.” I can’t help but wonder how many gas stations with a price around $4.36 per gallon Maloney passed as he was typing that tweet."
"President Trump on Wednesday signed legislation authorizing sanctions to punish Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the country’s mostly Muslim Uyghur minority.
Trump quietly signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act without a public event.
The White House announced the bill signing about an hour after bombshell allegations in former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton’s forthcoming book that Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping he approved of “concentration camps” used to detain thousands of Uyghurs in western China."
"Dr. Anthony Fauci announced on Monday that he will be stepping down as the president’s top medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in December.
“I will be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue the next chapter of my career,” said Fauci, who has earned the ire of many Americans for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, his discussions of vaccines, lockdowns, and the origins of the pandemic, and more.
“It has been the honor of a lifetime to..."
"MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” co-hosts addressed President Donald Trump’s tweets about Joe Scarborough’s dead intern Tuesday morning, calling it “unspeakably cruel.”
Scarborough and his co-hosts pointed to a New York Times op-ed written by contributing opinion writer Kara Swisher. In the Tuesday op-ed, Swisher called for Twitter to remove Trump’s tweets about Lori Klausutis – who was found dead at her desk while working as an intern for Scarborough’s congressional office in 2001. It was determined that Klausutis died of natural causes."
"President Trump's attorney is vowing to go to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court ruled Monday to allow New York City prosecutors to proceed with a subpoena for records including the president's tax returns.
Trump was attempting to block a subpoena which was issued to accounting firm Mazars USA by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. In a 34-page ruling handed down Monday morning, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a district court's ruling that state prosecutors can subpoena the tax returns of a sitting president."
"Harry Reid's legacy is thus cemented. Democrats' unprecedented filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch has been broken under the nuclear option they pioneered in 2013. Every single Republican voted to invoke the Reid Rule, including some who had expressed a strong hesitancy to do so; that's how indefensible Democrats' conduct has been. The Senate will now reach cloture on the nomination with 51 votes, setting up a final confirmation tomorrow. It's over. Neil Gorsuch will be the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court:"
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited President Joe Biden to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress on April 28, two days shy of the 100th day of his administration.
In a letter sent to the White House on Tuesday, Pelosi touted Biden's ""historic and transformative leadership"" and praised him for, in her words, turning his campaign pledge of ""help is on the way"" into ""help is here"" governing.
“In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Wednesday, April..."
"President Trump misidentified the nation’s first coronavirus fatality as a “wonderful woman” on Saturday — the victim, in fact, was a man who became ill while in a long-term care facility in Kirkland, Washington, officials said.
The patient, who died overnight Friday, was a man with “an underlying health condition,” Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County, told reporters in an afternoon news conference."
"The office of New York state Attorney General Letitia James issued a statement to Fox News on Tuesday night, confirming a change in its investigation of the Trump Organization.
The case has now become a criminal investigation after initially being a civil matter, the statement said.
""We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the organization is no longer purely civil in nature,"" James spokesman Fabien Levy wrote in a statement to Fox News.
""We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with..."
"House Democrats are hoping that a protracted fight with Republicans over the budget will swing voters to their side in the 2014 midterm elections.
According to The Hill, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is working on a ""chaos"" campaign theme to convince voters the GOP is more concerned with its ideology than acting responsibly to avoid a government shut down and protect the nation's credit."
"People simply referred to “the Queen.” They usually didn’t say “Queen Elizabeth.” They didn’t need to. Neither her name nor those of the countries she ruled were necessary to identify her. There are other queens, of course, but none has remotely the same stature or instant recognition. Mention of them is likely to prompt the fugitive thought, “I’d forgotten that country had a queen.”
Why was there only one Queen?
Partly it was her brilliance in balancing warm accessibility and the awe-inspiring dignified distance that makes majesty. She was “Her..."
"""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" host said Monday that the National Security Agency is ""spying on him"" and planned to leak his communications in efforts to cancel his show. 
TUCKER CARLSON: It's not just political protesters the government is spying on, yesterday, we heard from a whistleblower within the US government who reached out to warn us that the NSA, the National Security Agency, is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air. 
Now, that's a shocking claim and ordinarily would be skeptical..."
"Two top national security aides who listened to President Donald Trump’s July call with Ukraine’s president are preparing to testify Tuesday at House impeachment hearings as the inquiry reaches deeper into the White House.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer at the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, his counterpart at Vice President Mike Pence’s office, say they had concerns as Trump spoke on July 25 with the newly elected Ukraine president about political investigations into Joe Biden.
After they appear Tuesday morning, the House will hear in the..."
"A federal judge ruled Wednesday that President Donald J. Trump's Health and Human Services ""conscience rule"" that allows doctors, nurses, physicians assistant and more health care providers to refuse participation in abortion based on moral and religious grounds was unconstitutional. New York attorney General Letitia James led the lawsuit on behalf of 19 states and the District of Columbia, which argued that the policy allows Americans to ""openly discriminate and refuse to provide necessary health care to patients based on providers’ ‘religious beliefs or moral objections.'"""
"As usual, Donald Trump’s approach to news is non-traditional: Saying that the Tulsa police officer who shot and killed Terence Crutcher may have “choked,” as if she missed a free throw in the NBA playoffs, isn’t exactly how most people would put it. After all, choking doesn’t normally earn one a charge of felony first-degree manslaughter, as Officer Betty Shelby now faces."
"Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is under fire for reportedly retaining shares in a construction materials company following a Tuesday story in The Wall Street Journal headlined she had “pledged to divest.”
Chao agreed to take a “cash payout” in April 2018 for her shares in road materials giant Vulcan Materials Co. per a January 2017 ethics agreement prior to her confirmation. She was paid in shares now worth roughly $400,000 as deferred compensation for serving on Vulcan’s board prior to her confirmation, reported WSJ. The DOT’s head ethics official said..."
"The sweeping re-election of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie proves moderates are an integral part of the Republican Party, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky says.
""There's room in the Republican Party for moderates, like Chris Christie. They seem to be the only ones that are winning in the Northeast,"" Paul told ""The Steve Malzberg Show"" on Newsmax TV."
"President Trump on Saturday claimed China ""may"" have been behind a massive cyberattack on U.S. government systems -- a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attack was ""pretty clearly"" perpetrated by Russians.
Trump downplayed the attack, dubbed by one U.S. official as ""the worst hacking case in the history of America,"" as ""far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality."""
"We are less than 20 days out from Election Day and the shocking reports of attacks against Republican candidates and volunteers keep getting worse. In Minnesota, two Republican candidates for state office were punched. Shane Mekeland is a first-time candidate who is unfortunately entering politics at a time when violence seems to be condoned or shrugged off by leading voices on the left."
"Elon Musk has informed Twitter that he's terminating a deal to buy the social media giant.
A law firm representing the Tesla CEO sent a letter to Twitter on Friday, alleging that they appear ""to have made false and misleading representations"" when Musk agreed to buy the company on April 25 and have ""breached"" multiple provisions of the initial agreement.
The announcement from Musk comes after a month's long feud over how many spam and fake accounts are on Twitter, and the Tesla CEO requested that Twitter provide details supporting its internal estimate that..."

"After a preliminary victory on trade authority in the Senate Thursday, President Barack Obama sought to make peace with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) after a string of apparent political clashes.
During a press conference at Camp David on Thursday, Obama blamed the media for stirring things up.
“The issue with respect to myself and Elizabeth has never been personal,” Obama said."
"The raging coronavirus pandemic kept crowds thin at malls and stores across the country on Black Friday, but a surge in online shopping offered a small beacon of hope for struggling retailers after months of slumping sales and businesses toppling into bankruptcy.
In normal times, Black Friday is the busiest shopping day of the year, drawing millions of shoppers eager to get started on their holiday spending."
"GDP contracted at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday morning, meaning that slowing commerce added to the woes of high inflation.
The decline in GDP, which is adjusted for inflation, is a major reversal from the previous quarter, when growth soared to a 6.9% rate as businesses began healing faster from the pandemic.
Friday's report means that President Joe Biden now has to contend with economic contraction in addition to the soaring inflation that has strained households and driven down his..."
"Just shy of one in seven House Democrats has elected to retire this year, a historic record. It’s almost as if they’re trying to get out of the way of a coming anti-Biden tsunami.
Representative Kathleen Rice, who represents a majority of Long Island’s Nassau County, announced her retirement suddenly on Tuesday. Her seat went for Joe Biden by twelve points in 2020, but last year, it voted to oust incumbent Democrats from the Nassau County executive and district attorney posts. The seat is viewed as highly competitive, and Rice’s current..."
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired the country’s security service chief and prosecutor general while accusing dozens of their employees of collaborating with Russia.
Zelensky, 44, announced the moves during a nightly address Sunday while citing hundreds of criminal proceedings into treason and corruption within the country.

"Many of the 12 cities that experienced record levels of violence in 2021 moved over the past two years to cut police funding, overhaul law enforcement policies, or put fewer people behind bars.
The sweeping changes that city leaders across America pursued came at a time of intense scrutiny of law enforcement after a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, a black man, during an arrest attempt in May 2020.
But even some Democratic lawmakers have begun to rethink the reforms championed by activists as the number of homicides..."
"President Biden told Americans Friday that he was “convinced” Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to invade Ukraine — and warned of a massive military operation that could target the Eastern European country’s capital, Kyiv. 
“We have reason to believe that Russian forces are planning to — intending to attack Ukraine in the coming week — in the coming days,” Biden said in remarks from the White House Roosevelt Room. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.”"
"Broadly speaking, the Republican Party has made tremendous strides when it comes to gay acceptance over the last decade. In fact, a strong majority of GOP voters now support anti-discrimination protections for gay people, and a slim majority now support same-sex marriage as well. But this progress has been uneven, and in some places, intolerance and bigotry still reign within the GOP.
Texas is the prime example, unfortunately. The Texas state GOP just made waves for its decision to prohibit the Texas Log Cabin Republicans, a group representing LGBT Republicans, from having a booth at its..."
"Another 6.6 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the government reported on Thursday, as the economic shutdown due to the coronavirus continued to devastate the labor market.
Claims for the previous week were revised upward to 6.8 million. The three-week total for jobless claims now stands at 16.5 million.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department announced Thursday another $2.3 trillion in stimulus. They established a Main Street Business Lending Program and a Municipal Liquidity Facility to support the flow of credit to American workers, businesses, states,..."

"A bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday released its report on the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6 and offered recommendations to help prevent a similar breach in the future.
The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee announced the investigation two days after the riot broke out. The months-long investigation included two hearings and committees reviewed thousands of documents, a press release said. Members interviewed workers from the Capitol Police and various law enforcement agencies."
"Benjamin Netanyahu showed the opposite of grace as he exited from power on Sunday. If you want to evaluate his legacy on the basis of his final day in office, you will mark him down as one of history’s sorest losers. 
History will likely tell a very different story, one that cites Netanyahu’s time in office from 2009 onward as a hinge moment in history itself — as a period during which Israel moved beyond the existential drama of its first 60 years and established itself as an enduring, undeniable and formidable permanent..."
"This is the last Morning Jolt of 2021. I’ll see you January 3. Let’s close out the year by looking at what 2021 brought us and what 2022 is likely to bring. I think the one word that will most succinctly summarize 2022 is “reckoning.”
I can’t predict specifically what’s going to happen in 2022. But I think I can predict the general theme of the coming year: a reckoning, in the sense of a settling of accounts.
Up until the Trump era, America’s role in the world was shaped by..."

"Mortgage rates have rebounded from their pandemic-era record lows and are rising rapidly. Those rising rates will eventually tamp down demand and cool the smoldering housing market, although the question of how quickly remains to be seen.
The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.42%, up more than 1.25% from a year before, according to Freddie Mac. Three weeks ago, the rate sat at 3.76% — the fastest three-week increase since the 1980s.
Much of the pressure behind the rising interest rates comes from the Federal Reserve, which raised its interest..."

"As cars and buildings burned in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, on Monday night, officer Darren Wilson’s grand jury testimony was revealed for the first time as officials released some of evidence in the case. The Ferguson grand jury declined to indict Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown."
"Following last weeks GOP Convention, Mitt Romney has seen a bump in his polling numbers. Just one day after the convention ended, Rasmussen found that Governor Romney now leads President Obama. Romney now garners 47% of the vote compared to Obamas 44%. This is an expected modest bounce, but there could be an even larger bounce because of much of this data was collected before Romneys speech on Thursday night."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said unvaccinated students exposed to COVID-19 can remain in school if they undergo testing — as three New York City schools closed in one day.
The “test to stay” approach allows kids who aren’t jabbed and have been in “close contact” with an infected peer to keep going to class if they test negative for the virus at least twice during the week after exposure, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House press briefing."
"Jill Biden spoke to her husband's deep faith and perseverance through multiple tragedies in her Democratic convention speech, describing a personal side of Joe Biden that she may know better than anyone.
“How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole. With love and understanding — and with small acts of compassion. With bravery. With unwavering faith,” she said of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
The former vice president's first wife, Neilia, and 1-year-old daughter Naomi died in a 1972 car crash just..."
"Moments of national unity are as fleeting as they are rare. September 12, 2001, was one of them.
It’s become something of a political cliché to call for a return to that post-9/11 mindset. How much it has eroded, from then to now, illustrates why we hear this. Pew dug up an interesting figure — after the launch of airstrikes in Afghanistan, 79 percent of adults “said they had displayed an American flag.” Briefly, at a level that was unprecedented and never again matched in the modern age, a broad majority expressed..."
"The 12-member jury who will decide former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s future were given an intimate look this week at his seven-figure lifestyle and financial records, which the government say when taken together, provide evidence he was hiding millions of dollars of income from tax authorities."

While some details of the reconciliation package are unclear, Manchin said in a statement that the bill will contain a minimum 15% tax on companies worth more than $1 billion and will also have investments in energy, which include nuclear, renewables and fossil fuels.

"The three white Georgia men who chased and gunned down Ahmaud Arbery were each given life sentences Friday for what the dead jogger’s dad called a modern-day lynching “in broad daylight.”
Shooter Travis McMichael, 35, and his 66-year-old dad, ex-cop Gregory McMichael, were both told they would spend the rest of their lives behind bars without the possibility of parole. Even though they can never be released, both were also given an extra 20 years to run consecutively on a lesser aggravated assault charge."
"For most people, a list of the best news stories in 2020 would be extremely short. But even in a year marked by much grief and countless sorrows, there have been terrific examples of great changes for the better. Chief among these is the success of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s vaccine-development project. Few predicted that one, much less two, pioneering vaccines would result so quickly from this vast outpouring of effort and government funding to the private sector. The remarkable all-hands-on-deck explosion of ventilator production that began last..."
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen could be spending the next few years in jail. The sentencing memo from the Russian investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has recommended that Cohen spend the next four years in jail for the eight charges he’s plead guilty to. It also suggests that Cohen was not as cooperative as originally blasted out there by the news media.
"The European Union and the United States are on the verge of announcing a truce in their 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies, bringing to a close one set of Trump-era tariffs which had soured relations between them. As Reuters reminds us, the two sides have been battling since 2004 in parallel cases at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing and European rival Airbus
The EU and US agreed in March to a four-month suspension of tariffs on $11.5 billion of goods from EU wine to U.S...."
"Michigan saved Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid in 2016. On Tuesday, the state’s primary could end it.
After crushing losses on Super Tuesday, the Vermont democratic socialist’s White House bid is now counting on the Wolverine State to put him back in contention with its 125 delegates, after former Vice President Joe Biden swept the South and won the state of Texas last week.
Sanders defied the odds in Michigan in 2016 when he pulled off a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton — bucking polls that had him behind and winning..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin came out swinging at the U.S. on Friday in an aggressive speech as he announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions. 
In a message that was already expected to be hostile, Putin further escalated threats against Ukraine and the West by saying the U.S. set a ""precedent"" of nuclear warfare by hitting Japan with atomic bombs during World War II.
Fears have mounted since last week when Putin said he was ""not bluffing"" after he warned that Moscow would use ""all weapons systems available"" to defend Russian..."
"According to the experts, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) has zero chance of winning the 2016 Democratic nomination.
Nevertheless, on Thursday he announced he’s running for president, vowing to make his candidacy about issues that are extremely and personally important to the progressive Left.
“This country today, in my view, has more serious crises than at any other time since the Great Depression of the 1930s,” he said. “For most Americans, their reality is that they’re working longer hours for lower wages. And [in] inflation-adjusted income, they’re earning less money than..."
"Right up until the moment that he declared all large private employers in the country would be forced to require COVID-19 vaccinations, President Joe Biden consistently opposed COVID vaccine mandates. And he was not alone: Speaking in her capacity as an official White House spokesperson, Press Secretary Jen Psaki explicitly stated ""that's not the role of the federal government.""
Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also said there would be no mandate.
On December 4, 2020, Biden said the vaccine would not be imposed by mandate. ""No,..."

"Facebook-owned Instagram has announced that will ban all QAnon accounts, including ones that don’t promote violence, while refusing to remove ISIS propaganda accounts that celebrate 9/11 under the justification that “people may express themselves differently.”
In an update to its policy announced yesterday, Facebook said that it was moving beyond a measure taken back in August that removed QAnon accounts which contained “discussions of potential violence.”
“We’ve seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the west coast wildfires were started by..."
"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is confident that an urgently needed bipartisan coronavirus relief bill will soon be finalized.

"Ex-British royals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are again caught up in controversy and criticism for airing their troubles with Britain’s Royal Family in an interview with talk show icon Oprah Winfrey.
During the interview, Harry and Markle made many unsavory claims about their time as the duke and duchess of Sussex before they cut ties with the Royal Family and moved to the United States to begin lives as private citizens. The couple received heavy criticism for their decision to ditch the Royal Family, and again opened themselves up..."
"Although inflationary pressures keep building in the U.S. economy, economists believe the Federal Reserve officials are unlikely to tighten monetary policy before seeing significant improvement in labor market recovery.
From gas to groceries, Americans have started to see price increases in recent weeks as the economy reopens. Used car and truck prices, for example, surged 21 percent year-over-year, including a 10 percent increase in April alone.
Surveys also show that U.S. businesses are raising prices for their goods and services at a rate not seen since the late 1970s and..."
"A federal appeals court on Wednesday handed a major win to the Trump administration in its fight against “sanctuary” jurisdictions, ruling that it can deny grant money to states that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned a lower court ruling that stopped the administration’s 2017 move to withhold grant money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which dispenses over $250 million a year to state and local criminal justice efforts.
“Today’s decision rightfully recognizes the lawful..."
"The International Energy Agency (IEA) released a 10-point plan Friday to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels amid an historic worldwide oil supply crunch.
The IEA’s plan laid out a series of “practical actions by governments and citizens in advanced economies” that could be taken to lower the global reliance on crude oil reserves from hostile regimes. Russia’s grip on the global energy marketplace — the nation is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and second-largest exporter of crude oil and condensates, according to U.S. data — has come into focus after Russian President Vladimir..."
"Speaker of the House John Boehner has recently touted a list of 88 economists who warn against the expiration of tax cuts on high-income earners. These economists came together from some of the country's top universities, think-tanks and business organizations to write that the expiration of the tax cuts pushed by President Obama ""will hurt the economy and must be stopped before it goes into effect.""
Speaker Boehner also touted a study from Ernst and Young conducted for the National Federation of Independent Businesses that found that allowing tax..."
"A new poll says Americans are less likely to have negative perceptions of Obamacare’s rollout, yet two thirds of them still think its implementation hasn’t been so hot.
The Associated Press-Gfk poll says 71 percent of people who tried to sign up — or live with someone who has — have encountered problems, although the portion of those having success increased to 40 percent from 24 percent in December.

"The trial of former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann is set to begin Monday morning as Special Counsel John Durham’s yearslong investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe finally lands in court.
Sussmann is charged with making a false statement and has pleaded not guilty.
The trial is set to begin at 9 a.m. in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia with jury selection and U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Cooper presiding.
Durham alleges Sussmann told FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016 — less than two months before the 2016 presidential election..."
"President Trump’s Mideast strategy has been to strongly back Israel, support the Gulf monarchies, and press back hard against Iranian imperialism. His liberal critics insisted this would lead to catastrophe that never came, and on Thursday it delivered a diplomatic achievement: The United Arab Emirates and Israel agreed to normalize relations, making the UAE the first Arab League country to recognize the Jewish state in 20 years.
The agreement is worth celebrating on its own terms but it also holds lessons for U.S. foreign policy. On regional strategy, this shows..."
"Reporting on President Trump’s press conference Friday, several journalists and news outlets claimed the president said he hoped George Floyd is looking down from heaven and is happy about improving job numbers. A number of news outlets including ABC News, Business Insider, the Independent, and the New York Daily News also made the claim in news stories they published about the press conference.
A conservative media critic who tweets under the handle @AGHamilton29 quickly flagged the claims and pointed out further examples of journalists and news outlets making this claim...."

"Does the news media favor Hillary Clinton? Analysts bicker about it even as journalists scramble after the Democratic hopeful wherever she may be - though formal press conferences are a rarity in her campaign so far. A new poll, however, suggests that the press is at least very eager to cover Mrs. Clinton, and it’s having an impact: 66 percent of Americans now say they’ve heard “a lot” about Mrs. Clinton’s presidential intentions. Only 46 percent say they’ve heard a lot about the 2016 election itself - and far less..."
"Multiple airlines across the United States canceled hundreds of flights on Christmas eve, citing a nationwide surge in Omicron cases which has directly impacted employees and flight crew.
The cancellations come as more than 109 million Americans are expected to travel 50 miles or more via airplanes and other forms of transportation to visit friends and family over the festive period.
That figure is an almost 34 percent increase from 2020, with 27.7 million more people traveling than last year, bringing the number of people traveling during the season to pre-pandemic levels, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).
According to Flight Aware,..."

The update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be..."
"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday defended himself to fellow Republican lawmakers meeting for the first time after a New York Times report showed him criticizing then-President Donald Trump in the frenzied days after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

"The U.S.-Mexico border has become the world’s “deadliest” land crossing, according to data recently brought to light by a United Nations study.
A historic high of 728 recorded immigrant deaths and disappearances along the U.S.-Mexico border crossing in 2021 has made the land crossing the deadliest in the world, according to the study conducted by the United Nations agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

Democrats will push to include a provision to open a special enrollment period in a new economic relief package that..."
"President Joe Biden said Thursday he backs an ""exception"" to Senate filibuster rules to codify abortion rights.
He called the Supreme Court's decision ending the right to abortion “destabilizing” but said it does not affect U.S. standing on the world stage, as he took credit for modernizing the transatlantic alliance to adapt to new threats from Russia and China.
""I believe we have to codify Roe v. Wade into law. And the way to do that is to make sure that the Congress votes to do that and if the..."
"No one actually believes that Todd Akin is pro-rape. His problem is that he spouted off biologically false nonsense and used the term ""legitimate rape"" while discussing the subject on television. This suggests that Akin is either terribly misinformed, profoundly ill-equipped to run a competent Senate campaign, or not especially bright. Or perhaps some combination of the three. When one is forced to begin a political ad with a ""clarification"" that ""rape is an evil act,"" one is in very serious political trouble. I am utterly..."

""How do you feel about that?"" Colbert asked. ""And what..."
"The state of Mississippi has just filed its merits brief in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the big abortion case to be decided by the Supreme Court next term. At issue in the case is Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, enacted in 2018, which allows abortions after 15 weeks of gestational age only in medical emergencies or in instances of severe fetal abnormality.
It is difficult to see how the Court could rule in favor of Mississippi without overruling Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, so I’m glad to see Mississippi’s strong and straightforward..."
"President Biden on Thursday used his first primetime address to the nation to outline a gradual return to normal following the COVID-19 pandemic.
The speech set a goal for Americans to be able to gather in small groups by the Fourth of July and for all adults to be eligible for vaccine sign-ups by May 1.

"The director of the CIA insisted Tuesday that US agents' use of brutal interrogation techniques against Al-Qaeda suspects helped prevent attacks, in the wake of a critical Senate report.
John Brennan admitted that mistakes had been made in the years following the September 11, 2001 attacks on US cities.
But he said the Central Intelligence Agency's own review found that harsh interrogations ""did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists and save lives.""
This is disputed in the Senate report, a redacted version of a review that the..."
"President Joe Biden’s top science adviser routinely bullied and demeaned staff in front of their peers, a White House investigation into his conduct found.
The White House conducted a two-month investigation into Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) director Eric Lander over complaints that Lander would habitually demean and publicly upbraid staff.

"The Obama administration said Friday it is seeing mixed progress in fixing the federal Obamacare website, as Republicans piled on criticism by saying taxpayers should get a refund for the broken $400 million Internet portal and that new numbers indicate that few people have enrolled in the insurance market for the District of Columbia tied to the health care law.
Jeffrey Zients, the management expert tapped to fix HealthCare.gov, said his repair team knocked items off its to-do list this week, reducing the time it takes for pages to..."
Members of the community gathered to protest the police-related shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. What was a peaceful protest devolved into a horrific attack on law enforcement that left 12 police officers shot. Five were killed.

It’s one of the worst attacks on law enforcement in a century.
"Standing on the spot where Martin Luther King Jr. famously urged Americans not to judge each other by the color of their skin, President Obama said Wednesday that Americans must use the example of the civil-rights marchers of 50 years ago to press for his brand of economic justice for the middle class.

"A special three-judge court struck down Ohio’s congressional district map Friday, finding it was unlawfully rigged to the benefit of Republicans.
The decision is the latest in a series of lower court rulings striking down district lines as unconstitutionally gerrymandered. The fate of those disputes will turn on a pair of gerrymandering cases from Maryland and North Carolina the Supreme Court is currently considering.

"A few days before the Iowa caucuses, Ted Cruz called Marco Rubio a “Republican Obama.” It was intended to be an insult. Rubio should take it as a compliment.
Like Barack Obama eight years ago, Rubio is a young and handsome first-term U.S. senator, an eloquent speaker with a compelling personal story who is a candidate for the presidency of the United States."
"In a remarkable political repudiation, the Democratic-led House voted Tuesday night to condemn President Donald Trump’s “racist comments” against four congresswomen of color, despite protestations by Trump’s Republican congressional allies and his own insistence he hasn’t “a racist bone in my body.”
Two days after Trump tweeted that four Democratic freshmen should “go back” to their home countries — though all are citizens and three were born in the U.S.A. — Democrats muscled the resolution through the chamber by 240-187 over strong GOP opposition. The rebuke was an embarrassing one..."

Economists had expected claims to fall to 475,000. The previous week was revised up to 507,000 from the preliminary estimate of 498,000.
Jobless claims can be volatile week to week so economists like to look at the four-week average. This fell to 5340,000, the lowest since the pandemic struck last March.

"AstraZeneca and Oxford University on Monday said their jointly created COVID-19 vaccine has proven to be up to 90% effective and easier to distribute than another potential vaccine, which must be kept at sub-zero temperatures.
“These findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives,” said Oxford University professor Andrew Pollard, who served as the lead investigator for the drug’s trials. “Because the vaccine can be stored at fridge temperatures, it can be distributed around the world using the normal immunization distribution system. And so our..."

"At deadline, the presidential race hadn't been definitively called for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but it was clear that Trump had once again turned conventional wisdom on its head and smashed it.

By the wee hours of Wednesday morning, it had become even more likely that Trump was about to make history instead."

"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party won the parliamentary elections held Monday, but he did not meet his goal of securing 170 seats to form a majority government.
Trudeau called the snap election in August, bringing voters to the polls just two years into his minority government—a move that angered many Canadians who saw it as unnecessary given there was no “compelling ‘ballot box’ issue to justify the undertaking,” according to CNN.
His opponent, conservative Erin O'Toole, called the move a “power grab.”

Each year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day encourages an upsurge in volunteer work and charitable giving. Unfortunately, it tends to be just a one-day commitment. The annual one day of celebration each year of civic-mindedness isn’t enough to keep African American communities like mine thriving, especially when so many are struggling economically in the wake of the pandemic. For inspiration, we should look back to the Reconstruction Era,..."
"'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone made good on their plan to fire back at China after Beijing banned their long-running animated series over its criticisms of the Chinese government.
Wednesday night's episode on Comedy Central, called ""SHOTS!!!,"" reached a milestone as the series’ 300th – and included a profane response to Beijing.

"President Joe Biden’s administration has ordered 14 additional states to stop using a COVID-19 treatment made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on March 30 that it has paused shipments of the drug sotrovimab to the states, bringing the total number of states that are no longer receiving doses to 22.
The states are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin in the Midwest; Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in the West; and Alaska and Hawaii.
Previously, eight states in the Northeast U.S. stopped receiving..."
"The White House is reportedly floating the idea of gas rebates for U.S. residents due to record gas prices.
A White House official told FOX Business that the administration has not ruled out the distribution of gas rebate cards. The cards would hypothetically subsidize the price of gas for Americans – many of whom are struggling to make ends meet with fuel now priced at the level of a luxury good.
""The president has made clear that he is willing to explore all options and hear all ideas that would help lower gas..."
"Hillary Clinton launched her harshest attacks yet on Bernie Sanders during their debate Thursday night in Milwaukee, in a clear attempt to define their differences on major issues and win over black voters — but they had their most heated exchanges over campaign financing, who was the stronger supporter of President Obama — and who was a friend of Henry Kissinger."
"He had a history of abusing his ex-wife and stepson as well as a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force, yet the suspect in the Texas church massacre was able to obtain multiple firearms legally after passing background checks.
How? It turns out Holloman Air Force Base officials failed to enter Devin Patrick Kelley’s 2012 court-martial and conviction on two counts of domestic assault into the federal database."
"California's population decreased by more than 100,000 people in 2021, the second consecutive year the state has seen a population decline, officials announced Monday.
The state attributes its population drop off to reduced births and immigration, and an increase in deaths and people moving to other states. 
Despite the decline, California remains the most populous state in the country with an estimated 39 million residents. In comparison, second-place Texas is home to 29.5 million people.
California lost 117,552 people between Jan. 1, 2021 and Jan. 1, 2022, according to the state's Department..."
"Ten governors in the Northeast and the West Coast announced Monday that they are crafting joint plans for reopening schools and businesses in their states, putting them on a collision course with President Trump, who said he has “the ultimate authority” on when to reopen states after the coronavirus crisis eases.
“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Mr. Trump said.
In a move led by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that blindsided White House officials, the Democratic governors of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware..."
"A father and son got additional life sentences in prison on Monday for the death of Ahmaud Arbery after a judge handed down a pair of sentences in federal court.
Judge Lisa Godbey Wood of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia sentenced Travis McMichael, 36, to life plus an additional 10 years in prison on federal hate crime charges. He will serve his sentence in state prison along with his father, Gregory McMichael, 66, who was sentenced hours later to life in prison plus seven years. Wood declined..."
"If there’s one thing we can absolutely count on in our post-ethical partisan era, it’s that for every scandal, there is, in short order, a similar — sometimes astoundingly similar — scandal on the other side. Sometimes, the comparisons are just so on-the-nose that you have a hard time believing they’re real. Remember when Virginia’s Democratic lieutenant governor hired Brett Kavanaugh’s lawyers to defend him from allegations of sexual assault? Remember when his accuser hired Christine Blasey Ford’s attorneys? Remember when the leader of a #MeToo organization called Time’s Up..."
"The European Union's top official called for a full-scale ban of Russian oil imports to take effect by the end of 2022 on Wednesday.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen included the ban in a new suite of sanctions against Russia she proposed Wednesday. The sanctions would also hit more Russian banks, TV stations and target Russian officials believed to be responsible for alleged war crimes in Ukraine.
""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to..."
"The establishment has consolidated incredibly rapidly around Joe Biden after his South Carolina triumph.
Most importantly, Amy Klobuchar and Peter Buttigieg have both dropped out and are endorsing him. Part of the reason it was difficult to see anyone stopping Bernie was that it was hard to figure how the field could consolidate before Super Tuesday, which on the prior trajectory would have given Bernie an insurmountable delegate lead. Now, the field is at least partly consolidated with the exception of the increasingly pointless Mike Bloomberg campaign and of Elizabeth..."
"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has told the House of Representatives and the American people to ""go jump in the lake,"" says Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has been leading the charge to defund Obamacare.
Cruz, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, repeating his argument that a government shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act would be the fault of Reid and President Barack Obama, who have said they will not negotiate the issue.

"A Sunday morning tweet by President Donald Trump set off a flurry of misleading reports suggesting he had finally admitted that he lost his bid for reelection. ""Trump says for the first time Biden won the election,"" CNN said. ""Trump says Biden won,"" BBC News announced. ""Referring to Mr. Biden, the president said that 'he won,'"" The New York Times reported.

"A defiant President Trump pushed back Thursday against the outrage over his comments that he would be open to accepting opposition research from individuals from foreign countries, arguing he should have no obligation to call the FBI in certain cases while trying to turn the tables on Democratic lawmakers over their own foreign contacts.
“I meet and talk to ‘foreign governments’ every day,” the president tweeted Thursday.
Citing recent conversations with leaders in the United Kingdom and Ireland, France and Poland, Trump said, “We talked about ‘Everything!’ Should I immediately..."
"New York City's raucous mayoral primary today will be the country's most prominent test of ranked choice voting. How it all works out may make the case for wider adoption.
Democratic Party voters have 13 mayoral candidates on their ballots. They don't have to select just one to face off against Republican and third-party candidates in the November general election; they can choose and rank up to five candidates in order of preference.
With ranked choice voting, it's not enough for the top candidate to get a plurality of the votes. He or she must have a..."
"About half of us make New Year’s resolutions at this time. Most of us end up not fulfilling them, whether it be losing weight, becoming more organized or getting out of debt.
But here’s one resolution that may be easier to keep and help maintain your sanity during the upcoming presidential campaign. Stop letting all the “bad news” that floods your mobile phone or TV make you forget there’s a lot of good news out there that makes a bigger difference to all of us in the long run.

"Multiple news outlets are projecting that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) has won today's Nevada caucus, making him the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Sanders hasn't locked up the race yet, but he's now in a position to do so. Democrats look very much like they're about to nominate a self-described democratic socialist for president.
There are some hurdles Sanders will have to overcome first—namely the way the large primary field interacts with the complexities of the party's nominating rules. A total of 3,979 ""pledged"" delegates are..."
"President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Democrats on Wednesday to unveil a way to fund a $2 million infrastructure deal. In a last minute move, Trump, however, said infrastructure won't happen until a trade deal is struck.
“Before we get to infrastructure, it is my strong view that Congress should first pass the important and popular USMCA trade deal,” Trump wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. “It will replace the job killing Nafta, one of the..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its guidance once again to recommend that fully vaccinated persons continue to wear masks in certain situations.
Apparently, this reversal was made out of concern for the delta variant, which appears to be more transmissible, though not at all more deadly. That last part is key: Vaccinated persons are not falling seriously ill or dying from the delta variant because the vaccines work. Out of the tens of millions of people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, less than 0.037% have been hospitalized..."
"Multiple mass shootings in recent weeks have led to calls for Congress to act on gun reforms, with both chambers taking different approaches on how to address the problem legislatively.
Following the May 14 shooting at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 dead, the Uvalde, Texas, school massacre on May 24 that resulted in the death of 19 children and two teachers, and the five killed in a shooting at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical facility on June 1, Democrats in the lower chamber are pushing for substantial policy..."
"The Obama administration announced Friday that enrollment records for one in four Americans who selected health plans on HealthCare.gov in October and November could contain errors, raising concerns that consumers who think they have coverage won't actually be enrolled on Jan. 1.

"All states in America had begun a phased reopening of their economies as of Wednesday after shutting down non-essential businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19, the illness associated with the novel coronavirus.
Although lockdown orders remain in effect in a handful of states as well as the nation’s capital and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, some non-essential businesses in those regions have reopened, data compiled by the New York Times revealed as of Wednesday afternoon, echoing other analyses.
Still, Democrat-allied mainstream media outlets like the Times argue that..."
"A recently passed bill in Arizona allowing businesses to refuse service to gays and others based on religious beliefs is stirring controversy as Gov. Jan Brewer considers whether to sign or veto it.
Some businesses fear it will spark a boycott of the state, much like the yearlong one after Arizona passed a controversial immigration law in 2010.
The law intends to allow business owners the right to refuse service to anyone if doing so would violate their religious convictions. It was sparked by incidents such as a case in..."
"President Joe Biden’s new vaccine and testing mandate is expected to affect some 100 million workers, with employers scrambling to figure out how to comply.

“Practically half an hour after the president made his speech, I had a line of people on the phone wanting to..."
"The House of Representatives on Friday passed President Joe Biden’s $1.85 trillion Build Back Better Act, sending the measure to the Senate, where major hurdles could significantly change, or even halt, the legislation.
The vote came much later than intended.
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, stopped Democrats from passing the bill as they intended on Thursday when he commandeered the floor with a speech lasting more than eight hours in which he denounced the spending legislation along with the entire Democratic agenda."
"WASHINGTON – President Trump tried to alleviate fears of a recession on Sunday, echoing recent statements from his top economic advisers.
“I don’t see a recession,” Trump said as he headed to Washington D.C. after vacationing in Bedminster, New Jersey.

"Former Vice President Mike Pence rebuked former President Donald Trump’s assertion that he could have overturned the result of the 2020 election in a Friday speech.
Pence made the statement during an address to the Federalist Society, days after Trump attacked him for refusing to hold up the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in January 2021. Trump had reiterated his claim Sunday that Pence could have overturned the election.
“There are those in our party who believe that, as the presiding officer over the joint session of Congress, that I possessed..."
"Polls show that even his own party has very little confidence in him.
Every dog has his day, and apparently so does every miserably inadequate president.
Joe Biden, who has been out of touch, tone-deaf, and disturbingly incompetent from the outset of his presidency, suddenly has the “Big Mojo,” or at least the “Moderate-Sized This-Isn’t-Quite-the Legislative-Debacle-We-Expected Mojo.”"
"Attorney General William Barr, in highly anticipated Senate testimony Wednesday, revealed tensions between the Justice Department and Robert Mueller’s team over the special counsel’s final report on the Russia investigation, pointedly saying he was surprised Mueller didn’t come to a conclusion over whether President Trump obstructed justice.
“We did not understand exactly why the special counsel was not reaching a decision,” Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr later released his own letter saying he determined, from Mueller’s investigation, that obstruction charges against Trump were not warranted -- a decision..."
"A group of black-clad marchers turned violent Saturday night in Portland, Ore., smashing windows and scrawling graffiti on downtown businesses as protests continued to rage across the nation against the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.

The crowd of about 100 began..."

"  A grand jury indicted Gerson Fuentes, who recently confessed to raping and impregnating a 10-year-old girl, Thursday.
Authorities charged the 27-year-old illegal immigrant on two counts of rape, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The indictment said the victim was 9 years old at the time of the rape.

She also had a fever.
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said there should not be any 2020 presidential debates.
And just like that, she has made the idea of canceling the election-year showdowns between President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden into something far more than just chatter among news and political commentators.

She added, “I do not think that the president of the United States has comported himself in a way that has any association with truth, evidence, data, and facts...."

"Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday the US should arm Ukraine, a day after President Joe Biden’s remarks raised questions about an international response to a Russian invasion.
Biden seemed to imply during a news conference on Wednesday that the US and its allies might not be unified in response to Russia if it attacks Ukraine in “a minor incursion.”
The comments, which the president and White House sought to clarify amid backlash, served as a signal to Russia that it was okay to “take some” of Ukraine, McConnell said on..."

"So are we doing the thing where we are pretending that curriculum, instruction, and materials can’t be determined by school boards and state legislatures and should be left to radical education consultants who are hired by bureaucrats?
What is popularly known as critical-race theory in education debates is, effectively, an omnibus term for a series of propagandistic approaches to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) that are common in the corporate business sector, along with certain contested ideas about the extent and nature of systemic racism, and the appropriate remedies that follow."
"President Joe Biden is opposing creating a Jan. 6 presidential commission, Axios reported Thursday.
The president plans to continue urging Congress to establish its own committee, White House officials said according to Axios.

"Though Democrats are hammering Paul Ryan as the bringer of Medicare's doom, the Republican vice presidential candidate is far more popular among seniors than he's given credit for.
Same goes for women. And independents.
Surveys conducted shortly before Mitt Romney's VP roll-out show Ryan actually polls fairly well among all three of these groups. And while Democrats claim to be ecstatic at Romney's choice -- they say he's an easy target, and they've already gone to town portraying him as ""extreme"" -- the bookish lawmaker from Janesville, Wis.,..."
"President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner met for 45 minutes Monday morning at the White House, in the latest push to iron out the particulars of a possible deal to avert the looming fiscal crisis.
An end-of-the-year deadline fast-approaching, the debt ceiling is emerging as perhaps the biggest sticking point in negotiations.

"Performing an abortion in Oklahoma will be a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison under a bill signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday — just three days after lawmakers in Maryland went the other direction by expanding not only who can perform abortions but also requiring insurance to cover the procedure at no cost to the policyholder.
The new laws in Oklahoma and Maryland reflect a rapidly splintering legal landscape as Republican-controlled states enact abortion restrictions while Democratic-run states race to codify abortion rights...."

The gene instructs bodily cells to make a protein similar to coronavirus, which wards off infection."
"Late Friday evening, the Supreme Court, in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, issued emergency relief suspending California’s broad ban on indoor religious services. The Court ruled that California was “enjoined from enforcing the . . . prohibition on indoor worship services . . . pending disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari.” The order is limited: Relief was “denied with respect to the [25%] percentage capacity limitations” and denied with respect to the prohibition on singing and chanting during indoor services,” although the Court left the..."
"The regime of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad claimed Monday through state-run media that Turkey began launching aerial attacks across the border, as American troops are obeying President Donald Trump's order to withdraw to the United States.
Trump defended his decision as unconfirmed reports of airstrikes blanketed Twitter, largely traceable back to unverified amateur video. Syrian government-run SANA TV called it 'Turkish aggression' targeting the 'north-eastern countryside' of Syria where some Kurdish forces are based.
Claims of airstrikes are likely to ramp up military tensions and benefit both Syria and..."

"Fellow Republican Senate candidates buffeted Rep. Todd Akin with condemnation Monday over his controversial comments on rape, with GOP Sen. Scott Brown going so far as to call on Akin to bow out of the race for U.S. Senate in Missouri.
Akin, a six-term GOP congressman challenging Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill for her seat, found himself quickly isolated by Republicans after telling an interviewer that a woman's body can typically prevent pregnancy during a ""legitimate rape"" -- as he argued against allowing abortions in cases of rape, claiming..."
"California Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder got a hostile reception as he toured a Venice homeless encampment Wednesday — with one woman in a pink gorilla mask chucking an egg that narrowly missed the radio talk show host’s head.
Video tweeted by Spectrum News reporter Kate Cagle showed the unidentified black-clad woman steering her bike into position a few feet from Elder’s left shoulder before letting fly with the missile.
When the woman was confronted by a member of Elder’s security team, she told him to “take your hands off me, motherf—er! Touch me..."
"  Do a search for “Larry Elder” and gorilla on the CNN website and nothing comes up. Washington Post? Zilch. Nothing comes up on the New York Times site either, although if you make it to the 15th paragraph of a story entitled “The Vice President pushed back against the effort to recall Newsom in the Bay Area,” you will find a bland passing reference to Wednesday’s disgusting incident. According to our nation’s media leaders, it’s not a story that a white person wearing a gorilla mask attacked Larry Elder, a black man seeking to become..."
"Fighters of the Islamic State militant group are ready to battle a U.S.-led military coalition seeking to destroy it, the group's spokesman said in a new audio recording in which he called on Muslims worldwide to kill civilians of nations that join the fight.

The deal ultimately united centrist and progressive lawmakers in the party on a key issue ahead of the midterm elections. The Senate is unlikely to take up the deal before Nov. 8.

"The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing him seeking a review of Biden family dealings in the country – but the document does not show Trump leveraging military aid as part of a quid-pro-quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a bill passed by Congress to end U.S. military assistance in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.
In a break with the president, Congress voted for the first time earlier this month to invoke the War Powers Resolution to try to stop U.S. involvement in a foreign conflict.
The veto — the second in Trump's presidency — was expected. Congress lacks the votes to override him.

"There’s an old joke often expressed well into banquets and conferences, where a speaker says, “We’re at the point where everything that needs to be said has been said, but not everyone has said it.” We’re already at that point with the Democratic primary debates. Tonight was a three-hour ordeal, and candidates largely repeated the arguments they made in the previous two debates. There’s not much reason to expect tonight will generate any dramatic swings in the polling in the coming days or weeks. The conventional wisdom will remain that..."
"The Labor Department reported Friday morning that the U.S. economy added 196,000 jobs in March, showing a rebound from the February report and beating economists’ predictions.

"FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday that “Antifa is a real thing,” pushing back against Democrats who have questioned the threat of left-wing violence.
“Antifa is a real thing, it’s not a fiction. But it’s not an organization or a structure, we understand it to be more of a kind of a movement, or maybe you could call it an ideology,” Mr. Wray told Congress.
He said the FBI has opened a number of investigations into people who “self-identify as Antifa” this year.

"In his third run for president, Joe Biden finally secured the Democratic presidential nomination and opened his Thursday night acceptance speech on a unifying note.
“I'm a proud Democrat,” Biden said. “And I'll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election ... But while I'll be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I'll work hard for those who didn't support me — as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me.”

"At long last our political leaders are considering how they can reopen the American economy they put into a destructive coma. Let’s hope this overdue process doesn’t devolve into another fight between governors and President Trump that will confuse Americans and slow the return to normal economic life.

"Labor Day is traditionally an opportunity to recognize the contributions made by workers, but this year it's small businesses that are celebrating. That's because this Labor Day coincides with the end of enhanced federal unemployment benefits that were paying people not to work. These payouts have contributed to a record labor shortage that prevents small businesses from bringing the economy back. Oxford Economics estimates that roughly 11.2 million Americans will lose some form of federal unemployment benefits this week. This will help fill the 10.1 million available jobs nationwide. 
On Friday, the Labor Department released its..."

The order came eight days"

"Knick-knack wealth redistribution is back!
In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama infamously told Samuel Joseph “Joe the Plumber” Wurzelbacher that he believed, “When you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.” It cemented in many Americans’ minds that Obama and the Democratic Party were quickly becoming socialist.
Flash forward 14 years, and Obama’s vice president announced one of the largest wealth redistribution plans ever via a massive college debt forgiveness plan. This time, working-class individuals like “Joe the Plumber” will be paying for millions of college graduates’ degrees.

"President Joe Biden has just announced his plan to release even more oil, 15 million barrels, from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is the last portion of the 180 million barrels he authorized for release in March, which was the biggest withdrawal ever from the reserve that is supposed to ensure a supply of oil in case of a national emergency.
In this case, the national emergency is most likely the midterm elections, in which the president's party is likely to lose seats in Congress, in large part because of runaway inflation that is..."

"If you’ve ever made the mistake of signing up for campaign emails from Democrats, if only out of morbid curiosity, you are inundated with requests for money from every candidate and cause under the Sun. In an odd way, it’s amusing to get an email from Eric Holder’s group hyperventilating about Republican gerrymandering while ignoring states like Maryland (where I live) where the former Democratic governor admitted they drew the lines to eliminate as many Republican members of Congress as possible (they got two of three with a map that..."

"The loosening of federal rules for political spending has done more to help Democrats than Republicans, according to two recent analyses of campaign contributions.
Those facts run counter to a well-established national media narrative — one often repeated by liberal groups and Democratic lawmakers who bemoan the influence of corporate cash in politics after the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2010 opened the flood gates to unlimited political spending — that says Republicans and their big business allies have been able to unduly influence elections with unfettered spending."

"White-collar criminals should hope for one thing this Christmas: that they get to live under the Horowitz rules.
Michael Horowitz has testified that he found no evidence of political bias on the part of the decision makers who, under the Obama administration, relied on hilariously implausible “evidence” and falsified evidence of their own in order to launch a federal investigation of the Trump campaign. Rather than political bias, Horowitz says, the investigation uncovered a series of “basic and fundamental” errors. Democrats are cheering that aspect of the report, because they..."

The study, which was produced by two independent teams in the country, used ""a new next-generation sequencing (NGS) research assay"" from Thermo Fisher Scientific on Italian COVID-19 patients. The experts then compared them to a sample from the..."
"Five hundred thousand jobs.
That’s the number that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says may be lost if President Obama pushes through a raise in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, from $7.25. The report cranked up the heat online on what has already been a feisty political battle."
"The politically incorrect and offensive word the vice president used this time was “Shylocks.” During a recent speech, he was trying to describe the dishonest and greedy bankers his son warned him about, while deployed in Iraq, who knowingly took advantage of American soldiers. It’s unclear whether he was reading from prepared remarks, or speaking off-the-cuff, but the characterization has at least one Jewish group wondering what in the world he was thinking (via Yahoo News’ Olivier Knox and Hot Air’s Ed Morrissey):"
"The White House and a growing number of congressional Republicans support a renewal of the federal evictions moratorium and rental assistance payments in the next economic relief package.
The GOP support is due to the fear of a wave of evictions due to the pandemic downturn. The federal evictions moratorium put in place by the CARES Act relief bill in March expired on July 25.
Approximately 30-40 million people in the United States are at risk of losing their homes in the next several months without significant federal intervention, according..."
"The US Supreme Court on Thursday night struck down a federal eviction moratorium that was recently extended by President Biden’s administration without congressional support.
The decision to end the pandemic-related eviction freeze came as a result of a legal challenge to the policy brought by a coalition of landlords and real estate trade groups.
On Aug. 3, the moratorium was extended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite a lack of congressional approval.
The decision was a change of course for the Biden administration, which had initially let the previous..."
"Funding for the government runs out just before midnight Friday and Congress is not even close to passing a bill to avert a shutdown. 
""The vaccine mandate is going to shut down our businesses in this country, which is going to further disrupt"" the economy, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., told FOX Business Wednesday. 
He's one of a handful of Republican senators demanding that a continuing resolution includes a provision to withhold funding from the enforcement of COVID-19 vaccine mandates by the Biden administration. "
"In a move that has been foreshadowed for a year, the Republican Party this weekend will cancel presidential primary elections in four states, Politico reports.
Quoting ""three GOP officials who are familiar with the plans,"" the paper said that South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas, which between them comprise around 7 percent of the overall delegate haul, will simply wave away political competition rather than let the likes of Bill Weld, Joe Walsh, and perhaps Mark Sanford take a David vs. Goliath swing at an incumbent president whose Gallup approval..."
"Memorial Day is the most solemn of our national holidays. It is meant to be a time for Americans to remember, with appropriate displays of gratitude and honor, those who have died while fighting our country’s wars.
We must be especially careful this year, in the absence of large public gatherings, and amid all the fears, frustrations and losses from the global pandemic, that the true meaning of this national holiday not be lost.
The grievous trials of the past three months cannot be allowed to diminish the realization of..."
"Im not going to discuss the nature of the presidents weekly radio and Internet address in this forum, although you can read about it here if you like; I think Allahpundits admonition to the GOP will suffice for now. I am, however, very interested in this video which is notable for two reasons. (1) Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-IN) debunks the myth peddled by the White House and others that the presidents budget proposal is somehow a “compromise, and (2) why the Republican alternative is a serious, credible plan that will..."
"Republican senators finally got their opportunity Tuesday for a face-to-face talk with Ambassador Susan Rice about events related to the fatal attacks on U.S. outposts in Benghazi, Libya, but said they left feeling more confused and “disturbed than before the meeting.
“I am more disturbed now than before, said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who met with Rice for about 90 minute on Capitol Hill.
Graham was joined at the meeting by acting CIA Director Michael Morell and Sen

"New weekly jobless claims jumped 137,000 to 853,000 in the week that ended December 5, the Department of Labor said Thursday. That is far worse than expected.
Economists had forecast 724,000. The prior week was initially estimated at 712,000, the first decline after two weeks of rising claims, and was revised up to 716,000. Many economists think that decline was due to the Thanksgiving holiday, when many employers hold back from laying off workers and some workers do not bother applying for benefits until after the holiday.
Jobless claims can..."
"A federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s order prohibiting TikTok downloads in the U.S. on Sunday, less than four hours before the ban was set to begin.
The ruling from the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. will allow TikTok’s owner, Chinese technology firm ByteDance, extra time to receive approval from the U.S. and Chinese governments for a deal with Oracle and Walmart, though a November 12 complete ban of the app still looms if a deal cannot be approved."
"Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell is alleging that information about his ties to a suspected Chinese spy were leaked to the press in retribution for his vocal criticism of President Trump.
“I’ve been a critic of the president. I’ve spoken out against him. I was on both committees that worked to impeach him,” Swalwell told Politico on Tuesday. “The timing feels like that should be looked at.”
Between 2011 and 2015, a suspected Chinese intelligence operative, Christine Fang, developed relationships with Swalwell and a number of other American politicians, particularly in..."

"COVID-19 hospitalization rates hit an all-time high in the US on Tuesday, as the illness peaked in at least three states.
A record 61,964 people were hospitalized with the virus nationwide, according to a tally kept by the COVID Tracking Project.
That number exceeds levels reached in the early days of the pandemic, when 59,940 hospitalized patients were reported on April 15, The New York Times reported.
New cases of the virus are also setting records nationwide."
"On Monday, shortly after Sanders threw his backing behind the former vice president, the senator’s one-time campaign spokeswoman, Briahna Joy Gray, announced that she was not following suit. Gray, who has made no effort to conceal disagreement with other high profile national Democrats, asserted she was unable to support Biden because of his unwillingness to adopt progressive stances on the economy and healthcare."
"Negotiations toward a nuclear deal between Iran and the P+5 nations (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany) will continue through June, according to reports from Lausanne, Switzerland on Tuesday. The announcement was made to satisfy the self-imposed deadline of March 31 for a provisional agreement, with “technical” details to be agreed by July 1. However, major differences appear to have been redefined as “technical” to keep talks going.
The chief sticking point remains the question of what will happen to Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium...."
"Elon Musk on Monday accused Twitter of breaching its contract with him by failing to provide information about spam accounts — and once again threatened to back out of his $44 billion takeover deal. 
Attorneys for Musk wrote that Twitter has refused to provide information that would “facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the company’s platform,” according to a stern letter to Twitter that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "
"Well, he already left the House Freedom Caucus. He’s for the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump. It’s not shocking that Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) decided to declare his intention to leave the Republican Party. It’s the usual crap from these clowns. He’s doing it because of principles. That’s fine, but even his stance on why eh supported Trump’s impeachment was a bit shaky since it means buying into the alleged (and probable) abuse of power that was exercised by the government against the Trump campaign during the 2016 election...."
"President Obama said Thursday he has not gotten personally involved in the case of Ed Snowden, because he expects other countries to ""abide by international law"" and not provide harbor to a fugitive. At the same time, he indicated he does not plan to go to extraordinary lengths to capture the NSA leaker, saying: ""No, I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker."""
"President Joe Biden is set to announce the first female chair of the Federal Communications Commission, according to multiple reports.
Biden will nominate Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat and the current acting head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to chair the agency as soon as Tuesday, several outlets reported. If confirmed, Rosenworcel would be the first ever woman to serve as FCC Chair in the agency’s history.
Biden will also nominate Gigi Sohn, a former FCC official and founder of technology think tank Public Knowledge, to the open Democratic seat on the commission. Sohn..."
"In a surprisingly brazen article, “The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election,” Time magazine chronicles a myriad of pre- and post-election actions taken by a loose coalition of Democratic operatives, grassroots activists, mainstream media, tech companies, and corporate CEOs before and after the 2020 presidential election.
According to the article, the effort consisted of “a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of..."
"Corporate media has spent the last year arguing that Donald Trump’s claims about 2020 election integrity amount to “seditious” conspiracy theories. While maintaining that narrative despite the cognitive dissonance, Time magazine’s Feb. 15 cover story pulls back the curtain on a “conspiracy” among a “well-funded cabal of powerful people” in an “an extraordinary shadow effort” that successfully pushed Trump from office.
“In a way, Trump was right,” writes Time national political correspondent Molly Ball. “There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes.” She later describes this “conspiracy” as something that..."
"The Biden administration on Monday confirmed it will direct the Department of Homeland Security to ease travel restrictions on COVID-19 vaccinated foreign visitors.
White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said in a news conference that all foreign visitors need to be vaccinated and present proof of their vaccination before boarding a U.S.-bound airline. Those individuals must also show a negative COVID-19 test no later than 72 hours before flying, he said, adding that there will be no quarantine requirement.
Zients said the new rules, which go into effect in early November, will “protect Americans..."
"It had to end sometime. This is the last of the Inside the Beltway weekend candidate reports — that is, until we start tracking outgoing and incoming presidents, transition teams, long goodbyes, short tempers, hanging chads, hysterical journalists and everything else looming on the horizon. On this final weekend before Election Day, here’s where Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will be."
"The Special Olympics on Thursday reversed its vaccine requirement for upcoming games in Orlando, Florida, this weekend after receiving pressure from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration.
ABC News reporter Jay O'Brien revealed Friday that the state of Florida threatened the Special Olympics with a $27.5 million fine because it said the organization's vaccine requirement violated state law."
"Russia continued its assault on Ukraine Sunday morning on the 11th day of its invasion, a day after a temporary ceasefire fell apart and Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened Ukrainian statehood.
Putin once again blamed Ukraine leaders for Russia’s violent invasion, threatening on Saturday that if they “continue to do what they are doing, they are calling into question the future of Ukrainian statehood.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remained defiant, urging Ukrainians to pick up arms to fight back against Russian invaders.
“It is a special kind of heroism — to protest when your city..."
"It was a wild session on Wall Street, with big market swings, as investors assessed Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and the Federal Reserve's meeting this week which begins tomorrow. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a gain of 101 points or 0.3% erasing a 1,000+ point drop. The S&P 500 also curbed all losses to end 0.3% higher and the Nasdaq Composite, at one point down nearly 5%, rose 0.6%. "
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned congressional leaders Wednesday that the U.S. is on track to default on its debt sometime in October if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling.
Yellen said the Treasury would likely run out of cash in the coming weeks and exhaust its “extraordinary” spending measures to keep the country within its legal borrowing limit.
“Once all available measures and cash on hand are fully exhausted, the United States of America would be unable to meet its obligations for the first time in our history,” Yellen..."
"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday affirmed his finding of no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 election -- but said his report did not exonerate the president on obstruction either.
He also said he won't discuss the origins of the FBI's investigation into the president as he made his highly anticipated appearance before a congressional committee to discuss his investigation into President Trump, his associates and Russia.
“The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian..."
"The Senate Friday passed a measure to keep the government funded until Sunday at midnight, clearing the measure for President Trump's signature.
The legislation will provide Republican and Democratic leaders additional time to hammer out final differences in a coronavirus aid package they plan to bundle with 2021 government spending legislation.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, withdrew his objection to the bill after warning he would not agree to a final government funding bill until it is paired with the coronavirus bill.
""Let us get this package passed,"" Sanders..."
"“The House Republican majority is made up mostly of members who are in sharply gerrymandered districts that are very safely Republican and may not feel compelled to pay attention to broad-based public opinion, because what they're really concerned about is the opinions of their specific Republican constituencies,” the president said in an interview with The New Republic."
"A series of shootings at Atlanta-area massage parlors left eight dead Tuesday night and, after an extended manhunt, police have arrested a 21-year-old man who is believed to have confessed to the crimes.
“The attacks began around 5 p.m. when five people were shot at Youngs Asian Massage Parlor in a strip mall near a rural area in Acworth, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Atlanta, Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Jay Baker said. Two people died at the scene and three were transported to a hospital where..."
"The Hong Kong police have clashed with protesters in the city-state's airport on Tuesday evening as demonstrators continue to occupy the international travel hub for the fifth day straight since Friday, in a sit-in that has canceled hundreds of flights in the last two days.
According to Skynews, which has a film-crew on the ground providing a live-feed, the police claimed their officers arrived at the airport not to disperse protesters, but to rescue people that were captured by the protesters. But Skynews said that those allegedly captured individuals may..."
"The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled 8-1 that a Pennsylvania high school was in the wrong when it kicked a cheerleader off of her team for a profane Snapchat post that she made off of school grounds.
Student speech advocates will likely claim the ruling as a victory, although it was very narrow. The court ruled that while schools do maintain some interest in regulating students' off-campus speech, the factors in the case of the cheerleader, Brandi Levy, weighed against the school's actions. 
""[T]he school argues that it was trying to prevent disruption, if not within..."
"Walmart is set to end sales of handguns in Alaska and will discontinue the sale of short-barrel rifle and handgun ammunition in stores nationwide, the super chain's president and CEO announced Tuesday afternoon.
The store said it will gear its focus toward long barrel deer rifles and shotguns, supply much of the ammunition they require and provide hunting and sporting accessories and apparel, Doug McMillon wrote in a memo.

"Cory Booker said he backs legislation that would get Americans “thrown in jail” for owning ""assault weapons"" if they do not hand them over in a buyback program in which they would be sold to the government.
Booker, a senator for New Jersey and 2020 presidential hopeful, said that incarceration would be an option after a “reasonable period"" following the buyback offer.
“Again, we should have a law that bans these weapons, and we should have a reasonable period in which people can turn in these weapons. Right now we..."
"If, in 1987, the editorial boards of the major newspapers learned that a fanatical cult of angry moral scolds, representing a small sliver of the population, was successfully campaigning to remove books from the public eye with the not-so-subtle encouragement of the president and his political allies, they would have been outraged. In fact, liberal pundits were outraged — by far-less disturbing developments than these — and in the Nineties, they were re-enraged by suggestions that even the most deliberately offensive art should not enjoy a public subsidy, nor scarce..."
"Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known in households across America as Dr. Seuss, just became the latest cancel culture casualty.
If you have kids chances are you have probably found yourself on more than one occasion dressing them up as a character from their favorite Dr. Seuss book and sending them to school to celebrate his birthday.
Dr. Seuss’ birthday coincides with Read Across America Day, which was by design when it was founded by the National Education Association more than 20 years ago."
"You've seen the news — the government says inflation rose 8.5% in March compared to last year. That is up from the annual inflation rate last month, which was 7.9%. Both are the worst since 1981.
There are a lot of stories behind the big number. Inflation is up in every area of the economy. But the worst news concerns some very fundamental human activities: eating, finding warmth and shelter, and moving around. Look deep into the website at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and you'll see how bad inflation is in those..."
"The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas. It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far – socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. – will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates."
"The House on Wednesday is set to impeach President Trump along strictly partisan lines, setting up a January Senate trial that has already provoked a battle between Democrats and Republicans that will consume Congress in the new year.
In defiance of indifferent and sagging poll numbers for impeachment, House Democrats are poised to approve two articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing power and obstructing Congress.
The looming vote would make Trump the third president in history to be impeached by the House. He’ll join President Bill Clinton, who was..."
"The Biden administration’s decision to transfer the debt of college graduates onto working Americans – euphemistically called loan ""forgiveness"" – brings with it a host of policy and legal questions.
The move has a staggering price tag: at least $570 billion. And that’s not including the continued ""pause"" on repayments in place through the end of the year, costing taxpayers $5 billion each month. The cost is exceeded only by the unfairness of the action, which punishes the millions of Americans who dutifully paid off their student loans or avoided..."
"Voters in California, Michigan, Vermont, Kentucky, and Montana will weigh in on ballot measures this November deciding on the future of abortion access in their states.
All six states have proposed ballot initiatives that will either codify or restrict abortion rights, an increasingly galvanizing issue following the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June, eliminating the federal right to the procedure."
"Voters on Tuesday approved the legalization of recreational marijuana in Maryland and Missouri while rejecting similar measures in Arkansas, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Meanwhile, voters in five Texas cities passed ballot measures that bar local police from issuing citations or making arrests for low-level marijuana possession. But the most striking election result for drug policy reformers looking beyond the ongoing collapse of marijuana prohibition happened in Colorado, where a broad psychedelic decriminalization measure is winning by two points with 80 percent of votes counted.
Prior to yesterday's elections, 37 states had approved marijuana for medical purposes, and 19 of them also had legalized recreational use. The..."
"TJ Cox, who represented California’s 21st congressional district as a Democrat from 2019 to 2021, was indicted on 28 different counts of various federal financial crimes on Tuesday.
Cox defeated incumbent Republican David Valadao in the 2018 midterm elections before falling to Valadao in a 2020 rematch. The 59-year-old ex-congressman is accused of “15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, and one count of financial institution fraud, and one count of campaign contribution fraud,” according to a press release from the Department of Justice.
In that same statement, the..."
"U.S. President Biden said Thursday he is sending another $800 million in military aid to Ukraine to send an “unmistakable message” to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“He will never succeed in dominating and occupying Ukraine. That will not happen,” Mr. Biden said from the White House.
Paraphrasing Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. Biden said the U.S. will “speak softly and carry a large Javelin” in providing weapons to Ukraine, meaning some of the specifics will be kept secret.
It is the eighth drawdown of arms, equipment and supplies from Department of Defense..."

Still, many officials declined to comment when contacted by Fox News this weekend, and others – including..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that doubling up on masks or tightening the fit of a single mask can drastically cut down on aerosolized transmission by about 95%.
“In the study ... well-fitting masks provided the greatest performance both at blocking emitted aerosols and exposure of aerosols,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday. “Having both the source and the receiver wear masks modified to fit better reduced the receiver’s exposure by more than 95% compared to no mask at all.”
The report, published on Wednesday, found..."
"The economy grew at a record pace during the third quarter as it rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic, although it has not fully recovered to its pre-pandemic heights.
GDP increased by an annualized rate of 33.1 percent during the third quarter, a stark contrast to the second quarter’s annualized rate of 31.4 percent contraction, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. The figure is a measure of how much the economy would have grown if the third quarter rate had endured for a whole year."
"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a statement in defense of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, a political ally who is facing a federal investigation over allegations of sexual misconduct.
The statement came after The New York Times reported -- and a source told Fox News -- that Gaetz once asked Trump White House aides for a preemptive pardon at the end of his term.
But in a statement Wednesday, Trump said Gaetz never asked him directly: ""Congressman Matt Gaetz has never asked me for a pardon,"" Trump said...."

"Sen. Joe Manchin Saturday demanded President Biden apologize for saying coal plants ""all across America"" will be shut down, in a scathing statement just days before crucial midterm elections. 
""President Biden’s comments are not only outrageous and divorced from reality, they ignore the severe economic pain the American people are feeling because of rising energy costs,"" Manchin, D-W.Va., said. ""Comments like these are the reason the American people are losing trust in President Biden and instead believes he does not understand the need to have an all in energy policy..."
"Fittingly for someone who spent more than three decades as a member of the U.S. Senate, President Joe Biden holds the so-called world's greatest deliberative body in high regard.
Biden calls the Senate his ""second home"" in his 2007 memoir and, as that metaphor suggests, it is often obvious that the relationship is about more than just a physical place. Biden sees the Senate—with its arcane rules and combative but dignified atmosphere—as the embodiment of what government should aspire to be. When Biden stresses that Americans must learn to disagree..."

Trump had been expected to visit Denmark on Sept. 2-3 as part of his trip to Europe, but until his tweets Tuesday, there were no solid indications the visit to Denmark was centered on buying Greenland.

Pence will oversee a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to tally the Electoral College votes, which President-elect Joe Biden won with 306 votes to Trump’s 232. However, the vice president does not have the power to reject slates of electors, only Congress has that power and it has only ever been exercised in a..."

Judge Haywood Gilliam, an Obama appointee to the Northern District of California, said the Constitution gives Congress the power to control spending, and Mr. Trump’s efforts to do an end-run around Capitol Hill, after lawmakers explicitly denied him more money for the wall, was too much."

Tuesday morning, a panel in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that a plain reading of Obamacare says that only people who buy insurance from a state-run exchange can be given subsidies. That decision had Republicans cheering, and calling it a significant blow to the law that could unravel it entirely if millions of people were suddenly not eligible for..."

Existing-home sales declined by 5.4% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.12 million, according to a report by the National Association of Realtors released Wednesday. Sales were down a hefty 14.2% from a year ago.
Despite that, the NAR said the median existing-home sales price rose to $416,000, up 13.4% for the 12 months ending in June. The hike marks 124 consecutive months of year-over-year price increases, the longest..."
"The House Judiciary Committee will hold its first public impeachment hearing next week, and President Trump is invited to testify, panel Democrats announced Tuesday.
""At base, the president has a choice to make: He can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process,"" Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York said. ""I hope that he chooses to participate in the inquiry, directly or through counsel, as other presidents have done before him.”
The Democratic congressman sent a letter to Trump inviting..."
"President Trump hit back against a New York Times report about bank employees flagging ‘suspicious activity’ in accounts controlled by him and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, blasting it as more fake news by a paper that will go out of business when he leaves office.
“The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me,” he said..."
"Wisconsin's Tuesday primary is back on.
In a 4-2 decision along ideological lines, the state's supreme court ruled Monday that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers does not have the authority to unilaterally move the scheduled primary to June 9. Evers attempted to delay the primary due to the coronavirus pandemic through an executive order issued the day before the scheduled primary.
Republican lawmakers in the state immediately responded to Evers's attempted order by challenging it in court. Those in the Republican-controlled legislature have blocked delaying of the primary.
The ruling means..."
"We know that Iowa caucus results can change the discussion in New Hampshire and here’s the proof. Prior to Monday night, Donald Trump dominated media mentions within the state of New Hampshire the same way he dominated polls. But, according to research by The New Analytics Company, Trump’s lead in mentions has been cut in half."
"Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Sunday that the man currently holding that seat, Gov. Ralph Northam, will resign soon amid the mounting scandal over a photo on his medical school yearbook page that showed what appeared to be a man in blackface and a second person cloaked in Ku Klux Klan garb."
"The 2016 presidential contenders are begging their Iowa supporters to get to the caucuses Monday and Donald Trump, true to form, is in-your-face about it.
""You're from Iowa,"" Trump told a Dubuque crowd Saturday. ""Are you afraid of snow?""
A snowfall forecast to start Monday night appeared more likely to hinder the hopefuls in their rush out of Iowa than the voters who will be flocking to the caucuses in t"
"Several red states are eschewing federal recommendations for vaccine distribution and prioritizing the elderly and vulnerable over essential workers, in the hopes of saving more lives.
Texas, Florida, South Dakota, and Tennessee have decided to focus on groups that are the most at risk of death, including those with chronic conditions and elderly people who are 65 and up. That is a different distribution plan than the one recommended in mid-December by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which said that certain essential workers and those age 75 and..."
"Senate Democrats say they’ll agree to a proposal by Republicans to solve a debt limit impasse by extending the nation’s borrowing limit for only three months.
“We are willing to take this offer in order to stave off fiscal ruin,” Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the caucus huddled privately Wednesday.
Democrats aren’t happy with the plan.
They intended to pass legislation that would extend the debt ceiling until December 2022, but Republicans said they would not provide the necessary 10 votes to stave off a filibuster,..."
"The fourth round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine began on Monday, and before the talks, officials from both countries hinted at progress after weekend negotiations.
Hopes of de-escalating the war in Ukraine come after a bloody weekend that saw American journalist Brent Renaud killed by Russian gunfire and more than 30 cruise missiles hit a Ukrainian base near Poland, leaving at least 35 people dead. Overnight shellings also occurred in numerous parts of Ukraine hours before the talks.
""Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian..."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden really appears to be on the same page as his running mate Kamala Harris, mistakenly referring to plans in a ""Harris-Biden administration"" just one day after the California senator similarly suggested that she was on the top of the Democratic ticket.
While speaking at a campaign event in Tampa, Fla. on Tuesday, the former vice president attempted to make an appeal to veterans and offered a glimpse of what they should expect with him in the White House.
However, his remarks sounded like he would..."
"Vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris spoke of a “Harris administration,” while discussing economic plans during a virtual roundtable Saturday.
“A Harris administration, together with Joe Biden as the president of the United States,” she said before correcting what many are calling a “Freudian slip.”
Harris’ gaffe comes a few days before Joe Biden himself referred to a “Harris/Biden administration,” at a roundtable discussion with veterans in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday.
With worries about Biden’s mental agility, many people wonder if a potential Biden administration would really be Biden’s. The Federalist..."

The prominent lawyers are among several attorneys added to the team as the president's impeachment trial gets underway, with proceedings kicking off Thursday and moving into full swing next Tuesday.
The team will also include former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray and Jane Raskin, who was part of the president's legal team..."
"The University of Chicago refuses to be your safe space from new ideas. The University of Chicago’s acceptance letter for the incoming class of 2020 is more than that— it’s a declaration of academic freedom. The college’s Dean of Students Jay Ellison used the letter to welcome students and reclaim the definition of college. An education at the University of Chicago is not about “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings,” he wrote, but “rigorous debate, discussion…disagreement,” and even occasional “discomfort.”

"CLAIM: The Washington Post reported youth puberty blockers are “reversible” in an article critical of a South Dakota proposed law that would criminalize treating transgender young people with medical treatments or surgery.
VERDICT: FALSE.
South Dakota could become the first state in the nation to criminalize treating transgender youths under 16 years old with medical treatment or surgery.
A WaPo piece published on January 28 stated:
Hormone treatment, which can be used to delay puberty, is reversible and medical evidence suggests allowing transgender children to delay puberty until they are..."
"As Vice President Kamala Harris contends with intense scrutiny over her handling of the border crisis and other key issues, members of her staff are experiencing low morale and struggling to communicate with top staffers, according to multiple reports on Wednesday.
Communication issues and distrust between aides and senior officials on Harris’ team, including her chief of staff Tina Flournoy, have contributed to a ""tense and at times dour office atmosphere."" Politico reported, citing interviews with 22 current and former aides. 
Much of the criticism was directed at Flournoy, who aides claimed has limited access to Harris..."
"Kurdish Iraqi fighters, backed by U.S.-led airstrikes, launched a major assault Thursday aiming to retake the strategic town of Sinjar, which the Islamic State group overran last year in an onslaught that caused the flight of tens of thousands of Yazidis and first prompted the United States to launch the air campaign against the militants."

Quanta’s facility is close to other Apple suppliers across Asia, making it possible for Apple to achieve lower shipping costs..."
"More than 10 million people watched President Donald Trump’s reelection rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20, according to Gary Coby, the campaign’s digital director.

"The Benghazi investigative committee on Tuesday formally requested former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton give a transcribed interview detailing her decision-making in determining which emails she turned over to the government and why she wiped her email server clean.
Chairman Trey Gowdy said Mrs. Clinton’s “unique arrangement with herself” — in which she claimed complete control of government business emails — needs to be explained, and nobody other than Mrs. Clinton can do that.
The interview would be behind closed doors, but would be part of the committee investigation’s..."
"Prominent Democrats in Washington are weaponizing identity politics to defend some of President Biden's most controversial Cabinet nominees from criticism.
Neera Tanden, Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M. and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra have all faced intense scrutiny for their policy positions and public statements, but some Democrats are suggesting that the nominees' critics are motivated by prejudice.
During Becerra's second confirmation hearing to become secretary of Health and Human Services on Wednesday, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., suggested that Becerra was ""being held to a much different standard than..."
"One of Raj Sookram’s tenants stopped paying rent in December. Another man hasn’t paid him a cent in 20 months. He now owes Sookram over $20,000.
One woman stopped paying this spring, Sookram said, then demanded that he fix her hot water heater when it blew. That ended with city officials threatening Sookram with daily fines.
In all, Sookram said, about half of the tenants living in his 13 Rochester, New York, rental properties are behind on rent. Sookram said he’s struggling to pay his bills and taxes. He’s had..."
"New claims for unemployment benefits fell to 2.123 million last week, data from the Department of Labor showed Thursday.
That brings new unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, since the coronavirus pandemic began to claim jobs ten weeks ago to nearly 40 million.
Economists had been expecting around 2.1 million for weekly claims. The prior week was revised up by 8,000 to 2,438,000.
Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27. Each subsequent week has seen claims decline.
Continuing claims, those made after an initial application,..."
"The fight of Rand Paul’s life will not be against the Republican Party’s “establishment,” nor will it be against Hillary Clinton should he become his party’s presidential nominee in 2016. No, the great adversaries against which Paul will be contending for the remainder of his presidential campaign will be himself and the political press.
This battle was foreshadowed on Tuesday during an interview between Paul and NBC’s Today host Savannah Guthrie.
To read Today’s take on this interview is to come away with the impression that it was a collegial..."
"“She also focused on improving infrastructure, providing better resources to law enforcement, helping small businesses flourish and transforming local clean energy consumption and waste management,” the report noted.
Ketchum said what the Third Ward deemed important should be the focal point of her win, not her identity, according to WTRF.
“To make criticisms about the promises I’ve made or the positions that I hold, that’s fair game. But you know, talking about a person’s identity is incredibly vulnerable. And, I don’t think we have a space for that,” she commented...."
"President Joe Biden is directing federal agencies to identify and address financial risks posed by climate change in a sweeping executive order that could affect much of the government budget and many private industries.
The Thursday order is the latest action by the Biden administration to enlist the financial sector in fighting climate change, both through dedicated efforts to reduce climate-related economic risks and actions to minimize public investment in fossil fuels.
""The global financial sector will be a crucial player, helping channel capital into investments to green our society,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen..."
"President Joe Biden announced an agreement on a bipartisan infrastructure package Thursday, giving his stamp of approval to a plan spearheaded by ten senators. The new consensus marks the end to many weeks of negotiations and partisan gridlock over the president’s chief legislative priority.
“We have a deal,” Biden said outside the White House shortly after the deal broke. “We have made serious compromises on both ends.”
“They have my word, I’ll stick with what they’ve proposed. And they’ve given me their word as well. Where I come from that’s good enough..."

"New coronavirus cases across the United States have tumbled to rates not seen in more than 11 months, sparking optimism that vaccination campaigns are stemming both severe COVID-19 cases and the spread of the virus.
As cases, hospitalizations and deaths steadily dropped this week, pre-pandemic life in America has largely resumed. Hugs and unmasked crowds returned to the White House, a Mardi Gras-style parade marched through Alabama's port city of Mobile, and even states that have stuck to pandemic-related restrictions readied to drop them. However, health experts also cautioned that not enough Americans have been..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday laid down markers for what congressional Democrats want to see in the next legislative package in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including more money for small businesses, hospitals and local governments.
The leaders said Democrats do support $250 billion in assistance to small businesses, in line with what Republicans have called for, though Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer want at least $125 billion directed through “community-based” financial institutions that serve underrepresented communities.
They also want $100 billion..."
"Primary voters in four states headed to the polls Tuesday night to determine several contested races in key elections that might sway control of Congress in November.
Voters cast their ballots in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin, with most races called by late Tuesday. Additionally, some victors emerged from primary races that were left uncalled from last week, ousting one House Republican who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump last year.
Here are the biggest results from last night’s primary elections:
Tim Michels won the Republican nomination for Wisconsin’s governor, setting the stage for..."
"The Biden administration may launch a new offensive against Google this fall aimed at the tech giant’s advertising business, escalating the government’s battle with Big Tech to new heights.
The Justice Department is primed to file a new antitrust lawsuit as soon as September against Google over its alleged advertising market dominance, according to Bloomberg. Publishers have faced questions from antitrust division lawyers as the government reportedly prepares its litigation.
Advertising revenue is at the heart of Google’s business. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said in June that it raked in..."
"It sounds like good news: Annual premiums for job-based family health plans went up only 4 percent this year.
But hang on to your wallets. Premiums averaged $15,745, with employees paying more than $4,300 of that, a glaring reminder that the nations problem of unaffordable medical care is anything but solved.
The annual employer survey released Tuesday by two major research groups also highlighted another disturbing trend: employees at companies with many low-wage workers pay more money for skimpier insurance than what their counterparts at upscale firms get.

"The Justice Department responded Monday to a federal judge's order to hold a hearing this week in order to determine if she will appoint a special master to independently review the documents the FBI took from former president Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate on August 8.
According to the Washington Post, the Justice Department prosecutors said they already appointed an FBI ""filter team"" that ""identified a limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information, completed its review of those materials, and is in the process of following the procedures.""
The Justice Department's court filings state they..."
"President Trump on Tuesday is expected to sign an executive order on law enforcement reform in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an event that tipped off weeks of protests, as the nation grapples with racial disparities in policing and the criminal justice system that have spurred calls as drastic as the dismantling of entire police departments.
The president will deliver remarks in the Rose Garden and sign the order, which is titled ""Safe Policing for Safe Communities."" The event is scheduled for noon.
""Both public safety and..."
"A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Harvard can continue to use race as a factor in its admissions process.
An anti-affirmative-action group, Students for Fair Admissions, sued the Ivy League university in 2014, arguing that the school was admitting members of under-represented ethnic groups at the expense of more qualified Asian-Americans.
But Judge Allison Burroughs wrote in her decision, “Harvard’s admission program passes constitutional muster,” according to NPR.
“Ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race-conscious admissions,” Burroughs added.
The student group is expected to appeal, and experts predict..."
"Outside of knowing Wuhan coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, United States intelligence agencies are still working on nailing down exactly where in the city the virus came from. There's been speculation it came from an infected animal, likely a bat, that was sold and eaten at a Wuhan wet market. This theory has prompted a number of politicians in the U.S. and around the world to call for the closing of China's wet markets.
But increasingly it looks like the disease came from a bat being studied at the..."
"The United States’ rejection of Russia’s key security demand that Ukraine be barred from ever joining NATO leaves “little ground for optimism,” Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said Thursday before signaling that there is still a chance for diplomacy.  
Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed Wednesday that the written response had been delivered to Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and reiterated that the US would stand by its commitment to NATO’s “open door” policy that could allow Ukraine to join the alliance in the future.
“Right now, the document is with them, and the..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put forward data on Friday that showed the amount of young kids who are brought to the hospital and tested positive for COVID-19 went up in the past week, but there is more to the information than is first evident.
The data included kids who were taken to the hospital for issues other than COVID-19 and then received a positive test result.
The New York Times reported, “The rise may at least be partly explained by the overall surge of Omicron cases, which..."
"Citing the cost of illegal immigration to the State of Texas, Governor Greg Abbott pitched the idea of revisiting a decades-old case that requires public schools to provide education to the children of illegal aliens.

Abbott broached the topic when he was asked in a radio appearance about the state’s efforts against illegal immigration."
"Former President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit on Monday in a Washington D.C. court against the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol incident and against the National Archives in a bid to keep his presidential records classified, citing executive privilege.
Trump’s court filing, namely, argues (pdf) that the committee’s records request is too broad and doesn’t serve any legislative purpose.
“The Committee’s request amounts to nothing less than a vexatious, illegal fishing expedition openly endorsed by [President Joe] Biden and designed to unconstitutionally investigate President Trump and his administration,” the..."
"Radio host Rush Limbaugh called the on-going GameStop story ""the most fascinating thing"" to happen in a long time because it mirrors politics with elites trying to prevent ordinary people from benefiting – just like the political establishment has tried to hold down average Americans.
Robinhood, TD Ameritrade and others restricted trading on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively, following an unexpected surge in trading volume of shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Bed Bath & Beyond, BlackBerry and others. Limbaugh feels the move was made to protect hedge fund billionaires.

"As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean officials Saturday to discuss how to achieve the U.S. goal of denuclearization of the communist nation, the world was paying less attention to a related challenge: how to stop the North from continuing to sell nuclear capabilities and weapons to rogue regimes around the world."
"Democrats will keep control of the Senate due to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) narrow election victory against Republican Adam Laxalt, the Associated Press projected on Saturday evening. 
The race results come after several days of delayed mail-in ballot counting — Cortez Masto secured a win with just under 5,000 votes by the time the Associated Press called the race, with 48.7 percent for Cortez Masto and 48.2 percent for former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt. 
With Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly’s win in Arizona, Democrats will now hold a 50-49..."
"The jury has spoken. Derek Chauvin is guilty on all charges. Now it’s time for politicians to do what they haven’t done so far — act responsibly.
President Biden was completely wrong to weigh in on Tuesday, saying that he was praying for a guilty verdict. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was of course worse, saying crowds should get “more confrontational” if former officer Derek Chauvin was found not guilty. It was incitement, and it’s shameful that Democrats defeated a censure vote against her."
"China imposed sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens including legislators on Monday in response to the U.S. imposition of sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials accused of curtailing political freedoms in the former British colony.

"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler on Monday put a fine point on Democrats’ impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the president put himself before the country.

Based on the evidence presented, the committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump.
Mr. Nadler, New York Democrat, called the process..."
"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said Thursday that people should not travel for Thanksgiving, citing fears that holiday celebrations could further spread the coronavirus amid a sharp rise in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

The report marks the second straight quarter of declining inflation-adjusted GDP — a situation commonly used to define a recession. GDP tumbled at a 1.6% rate in the first quarter.
Thursday’s numbers indicate that the economy has been struggling to stay above water during the historic monetary policy tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve, which is trying to lower soaring inflation. Residential investment cratered, a sign of the housing..."

"President Biden’s address to Congress connected only intermittently with reality.
On his telling, every good thing that has happened in America since he took office — from vaccination to job creation — is a tribute to his wisdom, rather than a continuation of a trajectory set beforehand. All presidents say such stuff, and they all get away with it, although Senator Tim Scott made a valiant attempt to correct the record. Worse was the dishonesty of Biden’s sales pitch for his policies.
He insinuated that the ten-year ban on..."

"Contrary to media predictions (including mine), it didn’t take weeks. On Tuesday, incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Begich officially lost to his GOP challenger Dan Sullivan, giving Republicans their eighth Senate pickup in the 2014 midterms.
Begich had a lot of factors working against him in the Last Frontier. Alaskans were not happy with President Obama and therefore not impressed with Begich’s tendency to vote with him.
Begich’s gaffes also didn’t help. He managed to offend a female Republican Senator with sexist comments and then offered this lie during a debate..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Monday that federal sex-based civil rights law protects workers from discrimination on the basis on sexual orientation and gender identity.
The six-to-three decision established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act covers sexual orientation as well as an employee’s sex, meaning workers will now be protected in the 29 states that do not have laws protecting all LGBTQ employees from job discrimination. The ruling upheld decisions by lower courts that concluded job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was included in illegal sex discrimination...."

Under the Biden administration’s plan, the number of pharmacies authorized to..."

"When I wrote this analysis earlier, 'Plan B' was already on life support. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Shelley Moore Capito had signaled that they were no-go's on the GOP backup proposal, which would entail passing the same ""clean"" repeal bill approved by the upper chamber in late 2015. That was a show vote, I explained, and everybody knew it."
"The Senate will vote as early as Wednesday on legislation to extend government funding beyond a Sept. 30 deadline, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced.
The New York Democrat plans to bring up the legislation in time for the House to clear it for President Joe Biden’s signature.

"Donald Trump has been insisting for years that our country has been too economically dependent on China, so it is sad that it took a global public health crisis to prove he was right all this time. When he began imposing strategic tariffs on China in response to its long history of abusive trade practices, the liberals all of a sudden became free trade fundamentalists, predicting that this new “trade war” would harm the American economy because we have relied so heavily on cheap Chinese imports for so many years...."
"A Twitter official announced Thursday night that Twitter will be making changes following the firestorm of backlash after it censored two bombshell New York Post stories.
The first story on Wednesday indicates that Hunter Biden monetized foreign companies’ access to Joe Biden while the latter was vice president. The second story alleges that Hunter pursued business deals with one of China’s largest energy companies in an attempt to cash in “for me and my family.”
Vijaya Gadde, the global lead for legal, policy, and trust and safety at Twitter,..."
"Former president Donald Trump was effusive in his praise for the coronavirus vaccines in a recent interview with the Daily Wire’s Candace Owens, telling Owens that “the vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind.”
Owens began by asking Trump about vaccine mandates, citing “Big Pharma,” as a “huge topic on the minds of mothers especially.” Trump quickly restated opposition to mandates — “people have to have their freedom” — before pivoting to extolling the benefits of the vaccines. 
Trump called “all three vaccines . . . very, very good,” during..."
"Since House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., shocked his congressional colleagues early Thursday by withdrawing his name from consideration to replace John Boehner, R-Ohio, as Speaker of the House, Republicans have launched a relentless press aimed at convincing House Ways and Means Committee chair Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to put himself forward for the job."
"The number of new applications for unemployment benefits rose 37,000 last week to 412,000, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.
The number of new jobless claims represents the number of people who filed for unemployment in the previous week. The new figure was more than forecasters’ expectations of 359,000 new claims. The number is also higher than the week before, which saw 375,000 filings.
Weekly jobless claims are being watched closely as the U.S. economy recovers because recent monthly jobs reports have been less than stellar and have added to concerns that..."
"The Obama administration is optimistic that Iran’s new leadership could offer an opportunity to repair diplomatic relations with the United States and to permanently halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
But former Vice President Dick Cheney believes that, eventually, America may have to resort to military force.
In an interview on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Mr. Cheney was asked whether a strike on Iran is “inevitable.”
“I have trouble seeing how we’re going to achieve our objective short of that,” he said. “And I doubt very much that..."
"If the White House press corps wants to keep government honest, here’s a question to ask as President Obama prepares to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants by executive order: Has he sought, and does he have, any written legal justification from the Attorney General and the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) for his actions?"
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is outpacing her would-be Republican rivals in an early look at 2016 head-to-head presidential match-ups, as well as on favorability and key qualities voters are looking for in their presidential candidates.
Fifty-two percent of adults view Mrs. Clinton favorably in a new Bloomberg Politics poll, compared to 42 percent who view her unfavorably.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible Democratic rival for Mrs. Clinton if she runs, is at a slightly positive 45 percent/43 percent favorable/unfavorable split.
Thirty-two percent have a..."
"President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday, imposing tariffs of 25% on up to $60 billion of imports, with a focus on high-tech goods. While not as hostile as the $60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days, the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy."
"In 1997, Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while still an academic, wrote a famous historical study for the Brookings Institution: “Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of Oil Price Shocks” with Mark Gertler and Mark Watson.
It began by documenting that “essentially all the U.S. recessions of the past thirty years have been preceded by both oil price increases and a tightening of monetary policy.” So here we are again tightening monetary policy at a time of unaffordable oil price increases."
"American democracy—or, at least, the California simulation of it—requires that even disinterested and actively hostile non-voters mark a ballot so government officials can gin up participation numbers, says Assemblyman Marc Levine (D-San Rafael). Levine has introduced a bill that would make voting compulsory, with civil penalties for the non-compliant. It's a proposal that seems guaranteed to make disaffected non-voters become even less impressed with a sketchy political process.
If passed, the measure would ""require a person who qualifies and is registered to vote to cast a ballot, marked or unmarked..."
"In the name of “strengthening our democracy,” State Representative Dylan Fernandes has introduced a bill to force Bay State citizens to vote in November general elections — whether they want to or not. In California, Assemblyman Marc Levine goes even further: Declaring that “democracy is not a spectator sport,” he has submitted legislation to strong-arm Californians into taking part in every election, including local and primary contests.
Their goal is to make democracy better, but their results would make it worse.
Presumably, Fernandes and Dylan would not describe their respective..."
"Iagree with our editorial that General Mark Milley should be aggressively investigated and, if the Washington Post reporting is verified, removed from office. In fact, I think he ought to be pressed, as a preliminary matter, about whether the reporting is substantially accurate; if he concedes that it is, he should be suspended immediately pending an investigation.
But we need a real investigation. I carry no brief for Milley, who personifies the politicization of institutions that must be apolitical in a properly functioning republic. Nevertheless, conclusions about his alleged behavior have gotten way out in front of the..."
"Ye, the rap and fashion mogul formerly known as Kanye West, sparked new controversy Saturday night with a tweet pledging to take on “Jewish people” after finding himself restricted from his 18-million-follower Instagram account earlier in the day.
Ye, who spent the entire week in a media firestorm after appearing at a Paris fashion show with The Daily Wire’s Candace Owens wearing matching “White Lives Matter” shirts, asked Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, how he could be locked out of his Instagram account. But it was a tweet some..."

Obama will make his announcement, expected to protect roughly 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation, from the White House at 8 p.m. EST.
The president will go ahead with his plan despite widespread opposition from Capitol Hill Republicans, who have asked him to wait until next year when the GOP controls the House and Senate to try to reform the..."
"Attorney General Bill Barr, in an exclusive interview with Fox News, said the country must know “exactly what happened” with counterintelligence activities conducted during the 2016 election -- and he is determined to get to the bottom of the case.
In his first interview since becoming attorney general, Barr spoke to “America’s Newsroom” host Bill Hemmer during a visit to El Salvador for meetings with law enforcement officials. In pointed terms, he fired back at Democrats who have castigated him over his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report --..."

The two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were born in the former Soviet Union, are tied up with Ukrainian state-owned oil companies and marijuana ventures in Las Vegas, and a federal court found them to have stiffed business partners in the past. Federal authorities on Wednesday nabbed the two at the airport while trying to leave the United States with one-way tickets.

"A California judge ruled Tuesday that teacher tenure laws deprive students of their right to an education under the state Constitution. The decision hands teachers’ unions a major defeat in a landmark case, one that could radically alter how California teachers are hired and fired and prompt challenges to tenure laws in other states."
"On Monday, tens of thousands of people descended on the state Capitol in Richmond, Virginia, to exercise the First Amendment in defense of their Second Amendment rights. But if all you’d done was follow liberal media reports and take cues from Democratic politicians, you would have expected this political protest, launched in response to Virginia Democrats' anti-gun legislative agenda, to end in violence and be made up of extremists.
Examples of hysterical media fearmongering abound.
News outlet Axios billed the protest as possibly “another Charlottesville.” As my colleague Timothy P...."
"Former President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to launch his own social media platform in the coming months, after being permanently banned from Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms following the Capitol riots in January, an adviser to the former president said Sunday.
Jason Miller, who served as a spokesperson for the 45th president’s 2020 campaign, told Fox News that Trump will be “returning to social media in probably about two or three months” with “his own platform” that will attract “tens of millions” of new users and “completely..."

The Secret Service K-9s, Hurricane and Jordan, were treated for minor bruises after successfully fending off Dominic Adesanya, who jumped the fence and rushed the building, authorities said.
Mr. Adesanya, 23, fought the dogs, kicking one and throwing and punching the other on the ground. But the Secret Service said both were cleared for duty by..."
"Top advisers to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo influenced state health officials to remove data from a public report that showed coronavirus-related nursing-home deaths in the state had exceeded numbers previously acknowledged by the administration, a bombshell report says.
Details about the July report were disclosed Thursday night in a story first published by The Wall Street Journal.
The final report focused only on nursing-home residents who died inside those facilities and did not include nursing-home residents who were transferred to hospitals after becoming sick, the Journal reported.
That means..."
"President Biden announced Monday that he will nominate Jerome Powell to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, signaling that he believes the battle-tested central bank chief, who navigated the U.S. economy through the depths of the worst recession in nearly a century, is the best person for one of the most high-stakes jobs in the world.
The announcement ends months of speculation over whether Biden would stick with Powell, a Republican nominated by former President Donald Trump in 2017, or attempt to reshape the central bank by tapping Lael Brainard, the sole Democrat..."
"Progressive prosecutors always have the courage of their convictions as long as they’re just gasbagging about their lofty aspirations for society . . . which is to say, right up until their abstractions about “equity,” “systemic racism,” and the need to “reform” our “broken system” crash into the reality of violent, recidivist crime that destroys the lives of flesh-and-blood Americans.
At that point, it’s always some underling’s fault — some nameless bureaucrat who didn’t get the subtle, oh-so-thoughtful nuances of the boss’s position.
I mean, how could subordinate prosecutors in the..."
"Pennsylvania voters shouldn’t look forward to election results anytime soon, with even an unofficial tally for the swing state likely off the table until Friday, according to local election officials.
Due to a crush of mail-in ballots — which, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling, can be counted up to three days after Election Day — the fate of the state’s potentially crucial 20 electoral votes will remain up in the air for some time.
Because mail-in voters predominantly skew Democratic, early returns could potentially give false hope to President..."

McCarthy, a California Republican in line to become House speaker if his party wins the majority in November, is also vulnerable to criticism that, as shown on the tapes, he would have liked to see social media companies ban certain conservative firebrands from their platforms.

"President Joe Biden signed an executive order Friday that will steer frozen assets from Afghanistan’s central bank toward both addressing the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the country and compensating Sept. 11 victims.
The funds were frozen and held in the United States in the wake of the U.S. troop withdrawal and subsequent collapse of the government in Kabul in August.
The order requires the U.S. financial institutions holding the funds to transfer them into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The president said his decision comes after consulting with European allies, although he said some are not able to join the U.S. in banning Russian oil. Still, the European Commission (E.U.) said it plans to..."

So, before plunging the world into the cataclysm of World War II, Adolph Hitler engaged in a massive, clandestine, determined, effort to build Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe, under the guise of building out Germany’s civil airline, Lufthansa.
By 1935, Hitler revealed his new air arm to the world. The allied victors of World War I protested, but could do nothing.  Within five years,  the Nazis had intimidated Austria to give in to the Anschluss..."

"Just before midnight, the Supreme Court, over the incoherent objections of four dissenting justices, denied the request by Texas abortion providers for emergency relief against the Texas Heartbeat Act. The compelling procedural grounds on which five justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — ruled have no direct bearing on the substantive question whether the Court will overturn Roe v.

During a series of live tweets during the presidential debate between Biden and Donald Trump in October 2020, Jankowicz had referenced the laptop.

"From overturning Roe v. Wade to supporting the Second Amendment and maintaining religious liberty, the Supreme Court’s recent decisions have put the left in a sour mood.
The left certainly hasn’t taken the news well.
Despite the left’s obsession with the notion that the right is all about “undermining democracy,” the left has shown little trepidation in demanding we lay waste to republican institutions that stand in opposition to its agenda.
Pleas for “court packing” from Democrats have been building for a while. Undoubtedly, those calls will become louder now, despite caution from the Biden administration. The latter hasn’t stopped..."
"A day after saying Congress must ""step in and stop"" President Trump after he instructed U.S. forces to kill top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, Rep. Ilhan Omar said she was ""outraged the president would assassinate a foreign official.""

"The United States has never before witnessed a presidential primary debate during an ongoing impeachment process, and while Bernie Sanders insisted that all Democrats can “walk and chew gum at the same time,” tonight’s debate — perhaps overshadowed by the impeachment hearings — was an oddly flat showcase for the candidates, where almost every candidate seemed content to tread water and play it safe.
MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow seemed really eager to get the candidates talking about impeachment, which was not in the interest of the candidates. One way or..."

He didn’t win that concession, but he said two Democrats have come out forcefully..."
"The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision Monday that the NCAA has illegally restricted education-based benefits that could be used as compensation to student athletes.
The case was brought by current and former student athletes who played college football, as well as men's and women's college basketball.

A lower court ruling maintained the NCAA's rules of generally forbidding payment to student athletes, while allowing for education-related aid. The students accepted this, but the NCAA fought it, eventually..."

"New figures from the World Health Organization Thursday estimate that around 14.9 million people died ""directly or indirectly"" from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, more than double the previously reported death toll.
The estimate is focused around ""excess mortality"" as a result of COVID-19, meaning deaths caused directly by the virus and indirect deaths, such as people with cancer unable to receive treatment due to overcrowded hospitals. The lack of ""reliable"" death reporting methods in certain countries contributed to the rise, the WHO said."
"President Trump believes a House censure, like the one introduced by the House Freedom Caucus, is not enough to punish House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.

Well Trump wasn't laughing. And on Monday he suggested that Schiff's behavior was egregious that it amounts to treason..."

"Sen. Joe Manchin dealt a blow to fellow Democrats and President Joe Biden Thursday, announcing he won’t back a massive social welfare spending package that costs more than $1.5 trillion.
The figure, which Manchin has been floating publicly for weeks, falls far below the $3.5 trillion most House and Senate Democrats say they need at minimum to create a broad array of new government programs and assistance under Biden's Build Back Better Plan. Manchin's announcement is likely to thwart efforts to pass a critical bipartisan infrastructure plan on Thursday that Biden hoped..."

"The Trump administration said Wednesday it will attempt to add a citizenship question on the 2020 census while complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Department of Commerce v. New York. Five justices held that the Census Act allows the question, but a separate five-justice majority found the rulemaking that added the question was procedurally deficient. There is a way forward. The Constitution itself requires the collection of citizenship information.
Section 2 of the 14th Amendment provides that if a state denies the franchise to anyone eligible to vote, its..."

"Rep. Tom Rice’s vote to impeach former President Donald Trump ultimately cost him his seat in South Carolina’s deep-red 7th Congressional District.
The conservative record that Mr. Rice, a Republican, compiled over his five terms in Congress was not enough to beat his Trump-backed challenger, state Rep. Russell Fry, who won the seven-candidate primary race.
It was a different story in the more moderate 1st Congressional District where Rep. Nancy Mace defeated Mr. Trump’s preferred pick, former South Carolina state Rep. Katie Arrington, who fully embraced his stolen election claims.

In the latest episode of the EdFix Podcast, Ball complains that math is a “harbor for whiteness” and “the very nature of the knowledge and who’s produced it, and what has counted as mathematics is itself dominated by whiteness and racism.” She groans that considering math proficiency to be a sign of intelligence is “raced.” In response, host, Michel Feuer, dean of the George Washington University Graduate School of Education and..."

"Fox News has a report on the Biden Justice Department’s refusal to take enforcement action against radical leftists who have been conducting demonstrations at the homes of Supreme Court justices, blatantly seeking to intimidate and influence the Court while it has the Dobbs abortion case under consideration.
As Rich noted last week (citing Allahpundit), a federal penal statute, Section 1507, unambiguously criminalizes this behavior. I’ve heard some suggestion in the commentary in recent days that Section 1507 may violate free-speech principles. It doesn’t.
The First Amendment has always permitted reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. The degree of permissible..."
"A State Department spokeswoman said Friday that the department did not start automatically archiving emails from senior officials until February of this year -- raising questions about Hillary Clinton's claim that her emails were ""immediately"" saved whenever she corresponded with colleagues.
The former secretary of state made that assertion during her press conference earlier this week -- and in a lengthy statement put out by her office -- as she defended her exclusive use of personal email. Clinton downplayed concerns that official emails could have been lost by suggesting anytime..."

In an interview on CBS News’ “Face The Nation,” Tate said the state won’t shut down all schools because of 109 cases of students who are coronavirus positive.
“We have very objective measures in place to shut down schools if and when that becomes necessary,” he said of a shutdown.
“We have 300,000 kids in classrooms. We’ve had approximately 100 confirmed cases… it is the..."
"For several years now, we've been telling you that the biggest threat to Americans' basic freedoms is huge, publicly held corporations, particularly the tech monopolies. Unlike the federal government -- which, while stupid and dangerous, you theoretically have some control over -- these corporations aren't interested in what you think, and yet they have enormous control over your life.
However, our friends in the academic research community (specifically, New York University) have provided us with a corrective. On Monday, a pair of NYU researchers released what they described as a..."

"The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation voted unanimously on Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Facebook, Google, and Twitter to testify.
Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said at a commerce committee meeting Thursday that he hoped the bipartisan votes to subpoena Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sounded an alarm for the tech sector.

"Fiscal cliff negotiators are intentionally dragging the talks out to the last minute and will then give legislators a take-it-or-leave-it option with little chance for their own input, outgoing Sen. Jim DeMint has charged.
And he accused President Barack Obama of wanting to take the country over the cliff so everyone will have to pay higher taxes.
“There’s no transparent, democratic process at all — just a few people in a room — which I think they’ll intentionally draw out until the last day and then drop on us..."

"President Joe Biden didn't mention the border situation in his first joint address to Congress, but he's created a ""disaster"" there, former President Donald Trump said Thursday.

""They're pouring into our country by the thousands at a..."
"The Senate voted Saturday to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, marking the end to one of the most rancorous confirmation fights in modern times and securing a rightward shift on the nation’s highest court.
The chamber voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, mostly along party lines, after a weeklong FBI probe helped settle concerns among most wavering senators about the sexual assault allegations that nearly derailed his nomination and led to a dramatic second hearing.

President Biden has called the bill “a critical step toward ensuring that America lives up to our foundational values of equality and freedom for all.”"
"We have known about the People’s Republic of China’s exploitation of American enterprise for years. The problem is that we have not wanted to confront it. Ever since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it has been a relentless and pernicious economic adversary, routinely taking advantage of the greed and weakness of American companies. We should have taken actions previously to address imbalances in our trade relationships, but we didn’t. Now the pandemic has put these issues front and center.
In early December, China knew an infectious virus..."
"President Biden snapped at a reporter at the end of his press conference Wednesday in Geneva after she asked why he was ""confident"" Russian President Vladimir Putin would change his previously malign behavior.

"By now, you've likely heard a thing or two about the election in Georgia's 6th district. The special election is being heralded as a test on the Trump administration (although it's probably not), and tensions are relatively high for Democrat Jon Ossoff.

"The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday voted to advance H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, to the full chamber.
The 25 to 19 vote was along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed, and followed several hours of debate.

"It started with a handshake, but U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Lindsey Graham wasted very little time when their debate devolved into the same disagreements they would have had if they stayed in D.C.

"Workers claiming new unemployment benefits swelled to a record 6.6 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the country to shut down.
The historic jobless number, about double what forecasters expected, exceeds the previous record, by far, set last week of 3.2 million requesting unemployment benefits.

"President Joe Biden rescinded former President Donald Trump's executive order that would have denied visas to immigrants who were viewed as a financial ""burden"" to the U.S. healthcare system.
The White House announced Friday afternoon that it would not go forward with the Trump administration's plan because it ""does not advance the interests"" of the United States.

The investigation was started by Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus Vance. The probe may initially have been triggered by hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign, made..."
"As President Donald Trump quickly moves ahead to nominate a replacement for the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Democrats had hoped to halt that process in its tracks by convincing at least four Republicans that Trump's nominee should not even receive a vote before the election.

Susan Collins, a key swing vote in President Trump's impeachment trial, announced Tuesday she would vote to acquit on both articles of impeachment -- noting that Democrats' ""abuse of power"" charge ""did not even attempt"" to allege that Trump had committed a crime, and instead constituted a ""difficult-to-define, non-criminal act.""
Even as she criticized Trump's behavior as ""flawed,"" Collins further slammed House Democrats for delaying transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate for more than a month, saying the stalling and posturing undercut their arguments that..."
"A collection of weird reports are making people question what is actually going on with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sent a cryptic tweet Feb. 25 in which he wrote, “I wish I could share more, but for now I can say it’s pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin.” Given Rubio’s seat in the Senate Intelligence Committee, it’s possible he’s privy to classified information regarding Putin’s health and wellbeing in the wake of his invasion of Ukraine.

"Facebook is being accused of fiddling with its formulas to suppress conservative news.
That’s what some unnamed former Facebook contractors told the tech site Gizmodo—and it’s an accusation that strikes at the heart of the social network’s credibility.
Facebook relies on computer algorithms to determine what is “trending,” an influential designation that inevitably boosts traffic for what are deemed the hottest topics. But unbeknownst to much of the public, Facebook hires journalists to tweak these formulas, and this is where the question of political bias has erupted.
Gizmodo reports that..."

"Former President Donald Trump is suing CNN for defamation and demanding $475 million in damages. His lawsuit has nothing to do with the law. Instead, it helps Trump mobilize his supporters as he looks toward a 2024 presidential run. For a few million dollars in legal fees, Trump has gained media attention while bolstering his political narrative of fighting media bias and elites.
Again, however, this lawsuit isn't about remedy under the law.

"Some pundits and a whole lot of excited Democrats project the once fiery-red Lone Star State to be on the verge of going blue — or at least turning a shade of purple. Such a flip would upend national politics and threaten to put Republicans out of reach of the White House for a generation; Texas’s 38 electoral votes put it just behind California, which has 55, for the most. But the battle for Texas is likely to be a prolonged affair, a multiyear war of attrition that both parties..."

"On Tuesday, an overwhelming majority of Kansas voters defeated a referendum that would have added language to the state constitution declaring that the state’s basic law “does not create or secure a right to abortion.”
The ballot initiative was a response to the 2019 Kansas supreme-court ruling that held the state constitution contained a “fundamental” right to abortion since 1859. That judicial usurpation, plus the post-Dobbs, pro-abortion media monsoon, made the task of the pro-life movement very difficult in Kansas. But Tuesday’s defeat in a high-turnout election was so lopsided — 58.8 percent..."

"One of the “few regrets” of his presidency, President Obama said dolefully in his State of the Union speech, was “that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.” Were he endowed with “the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt,” he remarked, he could have done more to bridge the partisan divide. But he pledged to “keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.”

"When then-President Trump ordered a strike that killed two leaders of two terrorist organizations with zero collateral damage, many in the media, academia, and Hollywood immediately condemned it as impulsive and dangerous. When President Biden ordered a drone strike against alleged ISIS-K members that instead killed an aid worker and his family, the reaction in those same quarters amounted to barely a reprimand.
The study in contrasts underscores just how differently the two presidents’ actions are filtered through the media and academia prisms.
Trump’s attack on January 3, 2020, killed the Islamic..."
"The U.S. population grew by 0.1% over the year that ended July 1, the slowest rate in American history, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The bureau estimated that the population grew by 392,665 in the 12 months before July 1. It attributed the record low to “decreased net international migration, decreased fertility, and increased mortality due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Of the 392,665 people, just 148,043 came from natural increase (based on net number of births and deaths over a year), while 244,622 came from international migration. The bureau..."
"All 34 cadets from the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation who posed in a class photo raising their hands in a Nazi salute will reportedly be fired, the state’s governor announced Monday.
Gov. Jim Justice’s decision followed a state probe that found the class had been giving Nazi salutes since early on in their five-week training, according to a summary of the probe obtained by the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
However, the report also said there was no racist intent from the cadets because they did not fully grasp the..."
"The nuclear summit between President Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un fell apart Thursday when the parties failed to reach a deal over the issue of sanctions relief.
In a news conference Trump explained the meeting ended abruptly because of Kim's insistence on lifting sanctions without committing to the elimination of his country's nuclear arsenal.
“I am always prepared to walk,” Trump told reporters. “I am never afraid to walk from a deal.”
“I’d much rather do it right than do it fast,” the president said...."
"A Trump employee told federal agents that boxes containing troves of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were moved at the bidding of the ex-president before the Florida estate was raided by FBI agents in August, according to a new report.

The unidentified employee, who..."
"President Joe Biden condemned activists cornering Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in a bathroom over the weekend and filming the encounter but dismissed the tactics as common and ""part of the process.""
“I don’t think they’re appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody,” Biden said of the people who confronted Sinema on Sunday. “The only people it doesn’t happen to is people who have Secret Service standing around them. It’s part of the process.”"
"South Dakota is sending National Guard troops to assist Texas in securing the U.S. southern border.
“Tomorrow morning I’m officially announcing up to 50 National Guard troops to Texas to help secure our border,” South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem (R) tweeted on Monday. “The Biden Administration has failed to keep America safe. We shouldn’t be making our own communities vulnerable by sending police to fix Biden’s border crisis.”
The South Dakota national guardsmen will join others from Florida and Nebraska. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts (R) announced last week that he would be..."
"The Biden administration is reportedly set to announce Friday that the country is lifting its COVID-19 testing requirement for travelers heading to the U.S.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ultimately makes the decision to maintain or lift the requirement on U.S.-bound air travelers to test negative for COVID-19 before being allowed into the country. Senior administration officials told CNN that the CDC is expected to lift the restrictions at midnight on Sunday, and will reassess the decision in 90 days. Several other outlets also reported the U.S. is set to remove the testing..."
"President Trump commuted the prison sentence of longtime friend Roger Stone on Friday night, days before Stone was to report to federal prison to serve a sentence for lying to Congress and obstruction of justice.
The president said Stone’s 40-month prison term was “unjust.”
“Roger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump presidency,” said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. “There was never any collusion between the Trump campaign, or..."
"An all-time-high 64% of small business owners approve of how President Trump is doing his job, a survey that regularly gauges small business sentiments reports.
The rating is up from 60% in the final quarter of 2019 and 56% a year ago in the first quarter of 2019, according to the results of a quarterly CNBC/SurveyMonkey survey that polls small-business owners nationwide.
Respondents cited a phase one trade deal with China and favorable regulatory conditions for their strong approval of Trump."

"The jobs market’s progress appeared to stall last week.
New claims for unemployment benefits soared by 51,000 to 419,000 for the week ended July 17, the Department of Labor said Thursday.
Economists had forecast 350,000 new claims, a decline of 10,000 from the previous week’s initial estimate of 360,000. That estimate was revised up to 368,000.

"President Trump blasted his impeachment opponents Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast, taking a veiled shot at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for offering what he termed insincere prayers for him.
“I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,” Mr. Trump said with Mrs. Pelosi seated near him on the dias. “Nor do I like people who say ‘I pray for you’ when they know that that’s not so.”
It was Mr. Trump’s first public comments since the Senate acquitted him on..."

"With Queen Elizabeth II's passing, the United Kingdom enters not just a period of mourning, but of huge uncertainty. The queen provided a constant presence during 70 years of change—but she played another role. Given that she enjoyed such affection from the British people, she saved us from having to think about the inherent contradictions of a hereditary monarchy and our anachronistic constitution.
Brits loved the Queen, even though deep down plenty of us know hereditary rule is a terrible idea—as it consistently proves in other countries (even U.S.-style political..."
"President Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, the White House announced Thursday.
Biden, who is fully vaccinated and double-boosted, has been experiencing mild symptoms, the White House said. At 79 years old, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. After Biden recently took a tumble off his bicycle, his mental state and capacities came under heightened scrutiny. Besides the occasions in which he’s stumbled or tripped on camera, Biden has also delivered some embarrassing gaffes and stuttered during speeches, which some have attributed to cognitive decline."
"President Joe Biden’s nominee for U.S. attorney general, Merrick Garland, said during the first day of his confirmation hearing on Monday that the attacks on federal courthouses in the Pacific Northwest may not qualify as domestic terrorism because the attacks happen at night when the court is closed.
“Let me ask you about assaults on federal property in places other than Washington, D.C. Portland for instance, Seattle,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said. “Do you regard assaults on federal courthouses or other federal property as acts of domestic extremism, domestic terrorism?"
"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was 100% effective in teens ages 12 to 15, the company said Wednesday, providing hope there will be an option for people under age 16 before the next school year.
Pfizer said it found 18 cases within a placebo group but none in the vaccine arm of a trial involving over 2,200 participants. The antibody response also exceeded levels detected in an earlier trial of people ages 16 to 25.
The company said it will amend its emergency-use filing with the Food and Drug Administration in..."
"President Joe Biden will sign an executive order Friday aimed at “protecting access to reproductive health,” the White House announced.
The “Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services” is the Biden administration’s latest response to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. That decision, decried by Biden as a “tragic error,” has reportedly caused friction within the Democratic Party and the president, with some members quietly questioning the administration’s response.
Only Congress has the ability to codify abortion rights, so Biden’s executive order is designed to build “on the actions..."

""I believe in democratic socialism for the working people, not billionaires!"" exclaimed Sanders. ""Health care for all, educational opportunities for all!""
""What a wonderful country we have!"" interjected Bloomberg. ""The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with..."

"Before the end of the day, a budget-busting, deficit-hiking, $2.7 trillion spending deal will probably be on its way to President Donald Trump's desk, and he appears willing to sign it.
But you wouldn't know about that if you watched this week's Democratic primary debates.
The Senate is poised for a final vote on the budget deal later Thursday—the bill cleared the House with bipartisan support last week, after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hammered out the details last month. The two-year, $2.7 trillion budget deal..."

"For all the think pieces and Twitter tirades penned over the transgender athlete debate, in the end, it really was a picture that said the definitive thousand words. After winning the NCAA 500-yard freestyle by just shy of two seconds, transgender Penn student Lia Thomas stood victorious next to the two girls relegated to second and third place.
In the picture, Lia carries the trophy. Lia stands atop the highest podium. And next to second-place winner Emma Weyant and third place Erica Sullivan, Lia's body is clearly not that of..."

"I don’t think I can do this in the fall. What I mean by this is managing my kids’ new distance learning. Every time a day is finished I think, “How long can I do this?”
Much has been said about how colleges will struggle and some will close as a result of COVID-19. America’s aging and declining in fertility. More schools chase after fewer students. The moment that schools try to charge for the premium college experience while delivering a CD-ROM-level education over the Internet, the weaker ones will..."
"Some red-state Senate Democrats are fretting that the ongoing House impeachment inquiry could expand uncontrollably and become a “kitchen sink” of complaints about President Trump, Fox News has learned.
West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Montana Sen. Jon Tester specifically expressed concerns about a broadening impeachment push severely damaging Democrats' chances to win back a Senate majority next year, sources told Fox News.
The senators have told Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that leadership cannot allow liberal Democrats to push for the inquiry to include allegations about Trump illegally using..."
"Easter Day, which falls on Sunday for most Christians in the U.S., celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. After being executed on a cross on Good Friday, Jesus was buried in a tomb. That first Easter, some 2,000 years ago, God the Father raised Jesus from the dead. The account is found in all four Gospels of the New Testament in the Bible."
"You must file back to the Democrats’ convention in Chicago in 1968 to find a similar political forum which unfolded under such a pall and the potential for epic violence.
And frankly, as the GOP convenes its Cleveland conclave, things could be even more volatile after the three police murders in Baton Rouge."
"The number of people leaving the workforce hit a new record in November, according to data released Tuesday by the Department of Labor.
About 4.5 million workers quit their jobs in November, up from 4.2 million the month before. The number is the highest since the United States began keeping records of the statistic about two decades ago. The figure is equivalent to about 3% of the workforce.
The so-called quits rate measures the number of people who voluntarily left their jobs and includes those who left their previous employment for another job and people..."
"Split-ticket voters in Georgia are playing a significant role in tightening the Senate race between Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Republican Herschel Walker — after reelecting Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) by a nearly 10-point margin.
Neither candidate in the Senate race has yet to surpass the 50% threshold necessary to avoid a runoff, with 84% of the vote counted. In the gubernatorial race between Kemp and his 2018 Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, the incumbent governor was declared the winner before 80% of precincts reported their results, given that he earned 54% of the vote and comfortably evaded a runoff.
Experts have..."
"From sea to shining sea, ‘delete, delete, delete’ has become standard operating procedure for government officials seeking to evade public scrutiny.
Item: The January 6 committee wants relevant text messages sent by and to Secret Service officers for its investigation. The Secret Service says Congress can’t have them, because they were accidentally deleted — at least some of them after the committee’s request for them had been made — as part of a “device-replacement program.”
Item: In 2014, congressional investigators demanded that the IRS turn over emails to and from Lois..."
"The former acting director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that people are not getting their second dose of COVID-19 vaccines which “points to the importance of one-shot vaccine.” Statistics show that over 8% of people are not returning for that second, vital dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, according to a report in The New York Times this weekend. That means more than 5 million people have missed their second shot and may not have full immunity against the virus.

"Predictably, the United Nations Human Rights Council decided to launch a commission of inquiry on Wednesday into alleged war crimes committed by Israel during its current fighting in Gaza. And if you’re wondering—yes, it was a Palestinian-drafted resolution.
China, Russia, Latin American, African, Arab, and Muslim countries supported the resolution, while European countries on the 46-member council abstained. The United States was the only member state to vote against it.

"The United States is moving into a “new era of relentless diplomacy,” President Biden said Tuesday during the opening of the UN General Assembly, despite several glaring diplomatic blunders by his administration in recent weeks. 
In the days leading up to the UNGA, the Biden administration has been forced to answer to Congress for the chaotic troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as diplomatic frustration from France over the nuclear-powered submarine deal with the United Kingdom and Australia. "

"COVID-19 may be killing people and ravaging the economy, but for Mayor Bill de Blasio, it’s the perfect excuse to swing open city jail doors and free inmates.
That’s a fair conclusion anyway, given his recent boasts of reaching a “milestone,” with less than 4,000 people now behind bars after the city set more than 2,000 loose over virus fears. It’s “one part of the overall effort to create a system that is smaller, safer and fairer for all,” he gloats.
By “fairer for all,” he means “softer on those..."

"A number of hotly contested congressional races could rival the drama and fascination of the main contest between President Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Election Day and possibly beyond.
Republicans control the upper chamber by a 53-47 majority but that could be in jeopardy in Tuesday’s presidential election as some GOP senators are locked in highly competitive contests, including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine.

"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s two main political parties were deadlocked Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uphill battle to hold on to his job.
The election’s seeming political kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman, said he’ll insist upon a secular unity government between Netanyahu’s Likud and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White parties, who based on partial results are currently tied at 32 seats each out of the 120 in parliament.
Without Lieberman’s endorsement, both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority..."

“Earlier today, the secretary called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership,” said Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, in a widely reported statement. “While they’ve had honest differences on some issues, including"
"Turkey has launched a military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday, just days after President Trump announced that he would pull US troops from the area.
“Turkish Armed Forces together with the Syrian National Army against PKK / YPG and Deash terrorist organizations in northern Syria #BarışPınarıHarekatı has started,” Erdogan wrote on Twitter, according to a translation."
"First things first: Woodrow Wilson was a deplorable bigot and one of the worst presidents in American history. He re-segregated the federal government, glamorized the Ku Klux Klan, screened The Birth of a Nation at the White House, and opposed Reconstruction and black suffrage (Dylan Matthews has more on Wilson’s racism). In common with many progressive intellectuals of his time, he was a champion of eugenics. He sank the United States into the pointless carnage of World War I. He viewed the Constitution as outmoded and sought to snap its..."
"The vast complexities of a dangerous world were cast in too-simple terms in the latest Republican presidential debate.
In addition, Chris Christie pledged to make common cause with a Jordanian king who’s actually dead and Rand Paul wrongly stated that all terrorist attacks in the U.S. since 2001 have come from the hands of legal immigrants.
Here’s a look at some of the claims Tuesday night and how they compare with the facts:"
"Mother’s Day is going to be very different this year.
The Hollywood Museum is postponing its Mother’s Day tribute, which would have exhibited personal photographs from several stars over the years, due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, some beloved TV and movie moms who would have participated in the event still believe there are plenty of unique, fun ways you can say “thank you” to the special lady in your life."
"The House impeachment managers will begin their opening arguments on the merits of the impeachment of former President Donald Trump when the chamber convenes at noon on Wednesday, following a 56-44 Senate vote to move ahead with the trial Tuesday.
Meanwhile, speculation is running rampant about which Republicans may vote to convict Trump. The attention has mainly been on a group of moderate senators, but also includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that McConnell hasn't decided how he'll vote on the final conviction question and..."
"Chinese authorities locked down the entire province of Jilin, which shares a border with North Korea and is home to 24 million people, in order to contain the latest outbreak of Covid.
Beijing has relied on strict lockdowns and massive testing efforts to control previous outbreaks, attempting to bring Covid cases in the country to zero. The lockdown of Jilin marks the first time since the pandemic began more than two years ago that the authorities have resorted to shuttering an entire province. However, that strategy is now being tested..."
"It has become a tradition in American politics to greet each party's reversals of fortunes by proclaiming that it has been smashed beyond any short-term repair, perhaps even reduced to ""permanent minority"" status. This week we've seen just how quickly the conventional wisdom can see-saw: After a year of editorials about the decimated state of the GOP, suddenly we've started seeing takes like this:"
"The number of new jobless claims last week was 1.3 million, the Labor Department reported Thursday, which marks the 17th straight week that claims have exceeded 1 million.
Economists projected that 1.25 million jobs were lost last week.
On average, over the past four weeks more than 1.3 million jobless claims have been filed each week, according to the Labor report.
The total number of people claiming benefits for all jobless programs for the week ending June 27 was over 32 million. Compared to the same week last year, there..."
"House leaders of both parties said they expect to pass a measure granting President Barack Obama’s request to arm and equip Syrian rebels.
“The president asked us to authorize the training of the Free Syrian Army,” House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, told reporters today in Washington. “That’s what we’re going to do.”
The House will begin debate today on the measure offered yesterday as an amendment to a must-pass bill to fund the U.S. government through Dec. 11. Separate votes on the amendment and the bill, H.J.Res. 124,..."
"Obama wants to cap your retirement.
Inside his new budget he is proposing to cap qualified retirement savings at $3 million.
That's how much the White House figures it would take to generate $200,000 worth of income annually. However the problem with such an approach as investment news points out as that and in the historic low interest-rate environment it takes more money to produce $200,000 worth of income which is all you apparently"
"The United States will send 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to Canada and Mexico, the White House said Thursday.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, which is still pending FDA approval in the US but has been approved in other countries, will be shipped out to prevent those doses from continuing to go unused.
“Many countries, as you know, have already approved AstraZeneca[‘s vaccine] and also have requested our doses from the United States,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing, adding that while this includes Canada..."
"House Democrats are threatening to subpoena the White House in their fight for more documents related to President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees sent a memo to the White House demanding the key documents they need.
“Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with—or even respond to—the committees,” they wrote.
The subponea will be issued..."
"Vaccinated Americans will soon be able to travel to Europe with ease.
The European Union on Wednesday agreed on a proposal to relax COVID-19 travel restrictions for travelers visiting from outside its 27 countries, welcoming vaccinated Americans and a number of other nations, including the U.K., ahead of the summer vacations, according to the Associated Press. A date for when borders will reopen, however, has not yet been set. "
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski endorsed each other Sunday during a joint TV interview — as Manchin defended his opposition of President Biden’s $2 trillion social spending bill, saying he’s “not a Washington Democrat.”
The lawmakers put up a bipartisan front during their appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” ahead of their upcoming re-election races.
“I’m endorsing my dear friend Lisa Murkowski. Alaska could only be so lucky to have her continue to serve them,” Manchin, of West Virginia, said on the show.
“It’s hypocritical to basically work..."
"The Senate on Wednesday approved a two-year budget deal, sending it to President Obama's desk and staving off the threat of a partial government shutdown.
The bill cleared the Senate on a 64-36 vote. It passed despite the objections of Republican senators to a provision that cuts billions from military retiree benefit"
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and moderate Democrats struck a compromise Tuesday on the path forward to voting on the so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill and adopting the $3.5 trillion budget resolution.
The House passed on H. Res. 601, the resolution that contains the rule for the House to consider the so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill, otherwise known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, S. Con. Res. 14, the budget resolution, and H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021.
The measure passed 220-212, after House moderate Democrats led a..."
"President Trump said Wednesday he doesn’t plan to hand over his tax returns to House Democrats, citing an ongoing audit.
“I would love to give them but I’m not going to do it while I’m under audit,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he departed the White House. “I have no obligation to do that while under audit and no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you’re under audit.”
Experts disagree, saying nothing prevents him from following a decadeslong tradition of transparency among presidents, though Mr. Trump..."
"Former President Donald Trump is known for a lot of things, but one of his special powers is his ability to make the entire corporate media act in concert to bring embarrassment upon themselves.
For nearly a year, almost every major news outlet declared that it was a debunked, fringe conspiracy theory to even discuss the idea that the coronavirus pandemic began as a leak from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.
It so happened that Trump was the most visible person pressing the case of the “lab leak theory,” which meant..."
"Thirteen of the nation’s leading electricity companies are pledging to work with President Biden to slash carbon emissions ahead of Thursday’s international White House summit on climate change.
On Friday, the companies sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging the administration to design a wide-reaching energy agenda to curb carbon emission more than 80% below 2005 levels by 2030.
“A federal policy framework can be designed to support the power sector’s deployment of strategies that are technically feasible, ensure reliability, and maintain affordability for customers,” the companies wrote."
"Former Trump associate Roger Stone has become the latest person in President Donald Trump’s orbit to be sentenced for lying to congress, something that has so far not happened to any anti-Trump people who have lied to congress.
Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison on Thursday for lying to congress and obstructing the FBI’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in 2016 to steal the election. Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded there was no evidence that anyone on the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, yet..."
"The Secret Service was warned by one of Mike Pence’s top aides of a threat to the then–vice president the day before the storming of the Capitol, per revelations in a new book on the Trump presidency.
On January 5, 2021, Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff and the former White House director of legislative affairs to then-President Donald Trump, called to speak with Special Agent Tim Giebels, the head of the vice-presidential protective detail. Short reportedly told Giebels that Trump was going to “publicly turn” against Pence, which would..."
"Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday the federal government will recognize more than 1,000 same-sex marriages in Utah, despite an earlier announcement this week from the state’s governor saying the state would not.
The decision means those Utah couples will have access to federal benefits that are available to married couples in other states, including the ability to file joint tax returns. It also adds to the confusion in the state following a surprise ruling last month against the state's same-sex marriage ban."
"Michael Sussmann did exactly what he was accused of by Special Counsel John Durham. But the latter charged the former with lying to former FBI general counsel James Baker on the wrong day.
Durham’s team alleged that Sussmann told Baker that he wasn’t representing any client during a meeting at FBI headquarters on September 19, 2016, during which Sussmann handed over flimsy evidence of a secret communications channel between Russia’s Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization. In fact, the prosecution argued, Sussmann was acting on behalf of Hillary Clinton’s presidential..."
"If special counsel John Durham didn’t get the verdict he wanted in the Michael Sussmann case, it’s because he did a better job of convicting the victim than he did the culprit—the victim being the FBI, the agency to which the Democratic lawyer allegedly lied when claiming he wasn’t acting for the Clinton campaign while peddling slime about Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election.
In the indictment filed eight months ago, Mr. Durham went out of his way to show why the FBI would not have been fooled by Mr. Sussmann,..."
"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.75% on Wednesday as the central bank tries to fight inflation by decreasing consumer spending, but some economists aren’t convinced that it’ll be enough to stop inflation, or that it won’t push the economy into a recession.
The federal funds rate, the main interest rate that the Federal Reserve manipulates to control the economy, now stands between 2.25% to 2.50%, up from between 1.5% to 1.75%, according to the Federal Reserve’s press release. The Federal Reserve has been fighting inflation by raising rates since March, issuing a..."
"Vice President Mike Pence emerged from the 2020 vice presidential debate Wednesday night with a sound victory over challenger Sen. Kamala Harris. The debate was, of course, calmer and more focused on policy than the presidential debate between Trump and Biden last week. Although it may seem surprising that such conditions would work in favor of the bombastic Trump administration, Pence’s unflappable demeanor and meticulous preparation proved to be his big advantages of the night.
Pence started the evening by mounting a much better defense of the administration’s COVID response..."
"At the beginning of Holy Week one year ago, we watched in horror as the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris seemed to be going up in smoke right before our eyes. Though the damage didn’t end up being as catastrophic as we feared, what I wrote at the time, while the church was still lit up with flames, is a poignant reminder as we face an entirely different sort of tragedy this Easter:
Watching this holy place slowly collapse at the start of Holy Week — which will culminate..."
"Hillary Clinton is expected to unveil an overhaul of the capital gains tax rate this week that she says will strengthen the economy and create more jobs.
The only trouble is that her plan calls for raising the tax rate on investors, the ones who provide the lion's share of investment capital needed for business expansion which fosters stronger economic growth and creates more jobs.
There have been few details coming out of the former Secretary of State's presidential campaign which has been very secretive about Clinton's economic policies.
But..."
"Biden campaign national press secretary TJ Ducklo had a disastrous interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier on Thursday in which Ducklo appeared to be as eminently unprepared as your typical Trump White House surrogate, and grew increasingly agitated as the segment progressed. After Baier played clips of two experts that Biden has relied upon downplaying the coronavirus in late January, Ducklo claimed that “the vice president was not against the travel ban” placed on China by President Trump on January 31. Baier pressed Ducklo on this point, repeatedly asking if..."
"Former President Donald Trump filed a motion Monday demanding federal investigators stop going through material seized from his Mar-a-Lago mansion earlier this month until a neutralspecial master could be appointed to review the records.
The 27-page filing in Florida federal court also asked for the federal government to provide more detail about what was seized in the Aug. 8 raid on the 45th president’s Palm Beach estate and demanded the Justice Departmentreturn any item not covered by the search warrant.
“We are now demanding that the Department of ‘Justice’ be instructed to immediately STOP the review of documents illegally seized..."
"Congressional negotiators are said to be nearing a budget proposal for next year that would achieve the bare minimum -- setting basic spending levels to avoid a partial government shutdown, and tinkering around the edges of the sequester.
Sources tell Fox News that House and Senate negotiators are close on a possible agreement, at least on paper. Lawmakers have until Friday to finish off their work for the year.
""'Close' is a staff term,"" one senior lawmaker cautioned, suggesting it's unclear whether those drafting the bill yet have..."
"The White House announced Friday that President Biden will make his first foreign trip in June with stops in the UK and Belgium.
Biden has avoided travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being vaccinated, but will make the trip to participate in annual G7 and NATO summits.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, “This trip will highlight his commitment to restoring our alliances, revitalizing the trans-Atlantic relationship, and working in close cooperation with our allies and multilateral partners to address global challenges and better secure America’s interests.”"
"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is protesting CNN after the network snubbed her from a Democratic town hall just days before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 11.
Last week, CNN announced its lineups for a two-night town hall event set in New Hampshire on Wednesday and Thursday. The event is set to feature eight Democrat candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer on the first night, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen...."
"So much for President Biden’s pivot to the political middle. The fiscal 2023 budget he unveiled Monday re-proposes most of the bad ideas that haven’t passed Congress and adds a new one—a tax on wealth that he refused to endorse as a candidate in 2020. On the economy, he’s pivoting further left—presumably to fire up sullen progressives in November.
The White House is proposing a new “billionaire minimum income tax,” which the Federal Trade Commission would call false advertising if a private company tried that description. The tax isn’t limited..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 5 warned that Russia would strike new targets if the United States were to supply longer-range missiles to Ukraine.
Giving new weapons to Kyiv only aims to “drag out the armed conflict for as long as possible,” Putin told state-run media, adding that after longer-range missiles are sent to Ukraine, Moscow will draw the “appropriate conclusions” and strike facilities it hasn’t targeted.
“If they are supplied, we will draw appropriate conclusions from this and use our own weapons, of which we have enough, in order to strike at those..."
"The Republican party resembles the man who told his psychiatrist, “I have an identity problem, and so do I.” The party’s leader is at best indifferent to, and often is hostile to, much of the party’s recent catechism: limited government, the rule of law, a restrained executive, fiscal probity, entitlement reforms, free trade, the general efficiency and equity of markets allocating wealth and opportunity, and — this matters especially — the importance of decorousness in political discourse."
"President-elect Joe Biden said during an interview Thursday that he plans to ask the American public to wear masks for 100 days, starting the day he is inaugurated, in order to drive down the number of coronavirus cases. Biden, during an interview with CNN, said he will ask Americans to mask up, but only for a limited period.
""The first day I'm inaugurated I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask,"" Biden said. ""Just 100, not forever -- 100 days.""
""I think we'll see a significant reduction..."
"President Donald Trump issued a threat to anyone defacing a monument of former President Andrew Jackson, saying they'll face a decade in prison for doing so.
As protesters across the street from the White House spray painted the Jackson monument in Lafayette Square Monday night, in addition to defacing St. John's Episcopal Church, Trump called the acts ""disgraceful"" in a late-night tweet.
""Numerous people arrested in D.C. for the disgraceful vandalism, in Lafayette Park, of the magnificent Statue of Andrew Jackson, in addition to the exterior defacing of St. John's..."
"The claim by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 48 state attorneys general that Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp qualifies as anticompetitive behavior foolishly focuses on the motivations of the world’s largest social-media firm and ignores what those acquisitions have meant for consumers.
In the filings, the FTC and the states allege that Facebook snatched up the picture-sharing and messaging apps to prevent them from becoming a competitive threat. Perhaps it did. Maybe Facebook was indeed worried about being displaced as the market leader. But what does its motivation..."
"The emergence of transgender athletes in sports has created debate over whether a transgender woman or girl has a competitive advantage over a biological woman or girl.
With Thursday marking the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the discourse is only getting hotter.
The Biden administration wants transgender athletes to enjoy the same protections Title IX originally afforded women when it passed five decades ago. At that point in 1972, the debate about transgender athletes was many years away.
The debate comes down to advocates wanting to protect the space already established by Title..."
"The medical examiner for Hennepin County deemed George Floyd's cause of death a homicide.
The county's medical examiner listed Floyd's cause of death as ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression,"" meaning the autopsy deemed that the heart attack Floyd suffered was triggered by the manner of his arrest. The manner of death was listed as a homicide, which means that the death was caused by the intentional actions of another person.
The medical examiner already noted that early findings found Floyd had not died of asphyxia..."
"The U.S. and other world powers struck a historic deal with Iran on Tuesday to curb Iranian nuclear programs in exchange for relief from crushing international sanctions, an agreement that sparked dancing in the streets of Tehran, alarm in Israel and vows of a showdown in Congress with President Obama."
"The Illinois city of Evanston approved a reparations program Monday night for black Americans, making it the first city in America to carry out a program that seeks to redress past discriminatory practices.
The $10 million measure will be funded from annual cannabis taxes.
Passed by a vote of 8-1, the first phase of reparations makes $400,000 available in $25,000 homeownership and improvement grants, plus mortgage assistance, for black residents who can prove they’re direct descendants of Evanston residents between the period of 1919 and 1969.
“Right now the whole..."
"While touring areas of California ravaged by a historic drought, President Obama on Friday sounded an ominous warning and said that even if the federal government takes meaningful action to combat climate change, much of the damage already has been done.
“Unless and until we do more to combat carbon pollution that causes climate change, this trend is going to get worse, and the hard truth is even if we do take action on climate change, carbon pollution has built up in our atm"
"President Biden on Tuesday led about half of the world’s countries in committing to stop deforestation and reduce methane emissions — seeking foreign policy wins at a climate conference in Scotland amid a stalled agenda at home.
More than 100 countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030 and more than 80 countries agreed to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030.
But major countries sat out the methane pledge, including China, which is the world’s top methane emitter by far. Of the top six methane emitters, only the US signed on — with India, Indonesia, Iran and..."
"For very good reason, the media and Democrats feel threatened and terrified by the “Let’s go, Brandon!” chant, which is why we must never stop saying it.
If the organized left understands nothing else, it understands the power that comes when normal, everyday people realize they are not alone.
This is why, among the joyless left, there was a weekend-wide, five-alarm freakout over a Southwest Airlines pilot reportedly saying over the intercom, “Let’s go, Brandon.”
Before I go any further, it’s important to point out that this particular pilot incident..."
"Our 13 young military fallen deserved better, but they died with honor and give us faith in their noble generation, which has had to shoulder the burden of its feckless elders. A war that began when most of them were babies ended in disgrace when they were killed along with nearly 200 Afghans in last week’s suicide attack at Kabul airport during a withdrawal that could not have been more botched.
As President Biden attended Dover Air Force Base Sunday for the “dignified transfer” of the remains of these first US troops killed in Afghanistan in 18 months,..."
"Former President Donald Trump’s call for supporters to donate all their contributions to his new political action group could divide the Republican Party’s funds in the 2022 midterm elections, according to the Washington Examiner.
In a statement on Monday, Trump said, “no more money for RINOs,” or Republicans in Name Only, in a call for supporters to funnel all their planned donations to GOP candidates into his PAC.
“They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base — they will never lead us to Greatness,” Trump..."
"Former President Donald Trump has been held in civil contempt of court and ordered to pay a fine of $10,000 a day until he complies with the court's orders to turn over key documents.
Trump had been ordered to turn over documents to New York Attorney General Letitia James for her investigation into his business practices, but he has failed to comply. Nearly three weeks ago, James filed a motion requesting that the court hold him in contempt."
"While states such as Georgia and Alabama are restricting abortion access on the basis of fetal viability and heartbeats, Vermont is setting the stage for abortion to be included in its state constitution. The state legislature voted to push forward an amendment guaranteeing access to abortion. The state’s senate chamber already passed the same legislation.
The proposal, named ""The Right to Personal Reproductive Liberty,"" was approved 28-2.
Because of the stature of such a constitutional amendment, both chambers of Vermont’s state legislature will need to affirm this once..."
"The president of the Champlain South Towers condo association, in an April letter, wrote that damage to the garage had gotten significantly worse since a 2018 inspection and that the concrete deterioration of the building was ""accelerating,"" according to reports Monday. 
At least 11 people have died and more than 150 are still missing after the Miami condo partially collapsed early Thursday in Surfside, Florida. Rescue workers continue to search for survivors in the rubble. 
In the April 9 letter, the Surfside condo board president, Jean Wodnicki, wrote how the building was in desperate need..."
"The Trump administration is considering taking ""a number of options"" without congressional approval as negotiations on the fourth coronavirus stimulus relief package are stalled between the White House and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Fox News has learned.
A senior administration official told Fox News Monday that the administration is weighing taking unilateral action to quell the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""As the negotiations continue to progress as a snail's pace, the administration is considering a number of options that might be available without congressional legislative action,"" the official..."
"House Democrats early Saturday narrowly approved President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus bill, overcoming Republican opposition and accusations of waste in the “emergency” package.
The American Rescue Plan Act passed 219 to 212 just before 2 a.m., garnering not one Republican vote.
Two Democrats, Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon, voted against the measure, which gives $1,400 stimulus checks to adults earning $75,000 or less a year."
"Florida could hit the peak of its latest COVID-19 surge next week with some 23,000 cases, with herd immunity to follow in mid-September, according to an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida.
Edwin Michael, PhD, professor of epidemiology at the USF College of Public Health, projected the peak will occur on Aug. 24, and along with the current pace of vaccinations, the state could see herd immunity by Sept. 11. Herd immunity was defined as 90% of the population with antibodies from prior infection or vaccination.
The projected peak in infections..."
"The top executives of four major tech companies—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google—were hauled before Congress on Wednesday; each accused of being an online monopoly that may require government action.
Math, as the $26 trillion national debt might suggest, is not exactly Congress' strong suit.
One thing Congress is quite good at, however, is putting on a show—and Wednesday's hearing of the House Judiciary Committee was more about theatrics than seriously considering the use of antitrust law. Perhaps that's because it's somewhat ridiculous to argue with a straight face that Google..."
"According to Axios, President Trump is gearing up to sign an executive order that would, in their words, “remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil.” There is some ambiguity in this formulation. Will the executive order in question limit birthright citizenship to the children of U.S. citizens, or will it extend citizenship to the children of lawful permanent residents, as in the case of most market democracies that have revised their birthright citizenship rules in recent decades?"
"Democrats have released the text of their massive social spending bill, outlining many of the priorities of President Biden's ""Build Back Better"" plan.
The 1684-page bill, released Thursday, comes just one day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., signaled optimism that various factions of the Democratic caucus were close to reaching a deal on the legislation.
""As we have insisted, we are close to agreement on the priorities and the topline of the legislation, which can and must pass the House and Senate,"" Pelosi said in a letter to Democrats Wednesday. ""At the same..."
"U.S. job growth faltered in December just before the rapid spread of the new omicron coronavirus variant cast a fresh threat over the economy and its recovery from the pandemic.
The Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday that payrolls in December rose by 199,000, sharply missing the 400,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, which is calculated based on a separate survey, dropped to 3.9% from 4.2% — the lowest level since the pandemic began. 
The labor market had been gaining momentum after a delta-induced slowdown over the..."
"As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, boosting the need for ventilators, companies are ramping up their efforts to keep up with demand.
From the Netherlands to Wisconsin, to Southern California, companies that manufacture the lifesaving machines all said they are stepping up production.
A spokesman for Vyaire Medical Inc., which is based in Illinois, said the company is adding a second shift at its Palm Springs, Calif., factory and hiring more workers. As a global supplier, it has previously shipped ventilators to China and now is getting..."
"On the eve of Super Tuesday, a confident Joe Biden glanced back to his landslide victory in South Carolina over the weekend and looked ahead to what he thinks will be a very good night. The former vice president told supporters in Houston that ""we won in South Carolina, and we’ll win in Texas tomorrow.”
Texas is the second biggest prize on Super Tuesday – when a third of all Democratic presidential nomination delegates are up for grabs. Fourteen states from coast to coast hold primaries on a single day...."
"President Bashar Assad has traveled to Moscow in his first known trip abroad since war broke out in Syria in 2011, meeting his strongest ally Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The two leaders stressed that the military operations in Syria-- in which Moscow is the latest and most powerful addition-- must lead to a political process."
"A release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis today surprised analysts when the top-line number showed that the economy shrunk in the last quarter of 2013 by a slight 0.1%. While small, it was unexpected. This marks the first time the American economy has shrunk since the end of the 2008 recession.
Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States -- decreased at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 (that..."
"Flags at the White House and U.S. Capitol were lowered to half staff Saturday morning to honor the late Rep. John Lewis, who died Friday night at the age of 80 and President Trump ordered all American flags to be lowered nationwide for the rest of the day.
The tribute to signify a nation in mourning is the first of what is expected to be many ways the civil rights leader and longtime congressman from Georgia will be eulogized.It's possible Lewis will lie in state at the Capitol, an honor..."
"President Obama is using the national debate over gun violence to push for further action on his health care law, including insisting on the kind of mental health coverage states must provide under their Medicaid programs.
Mr. Obama, unveiling his gun proposals Wednesday barely a month after the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., will make it clear that his health law, known as the Affordable Care Act, allows doctors to ask patients whether they have guns in their homes, and will tell them they are able to report..."
"Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene easily won a crowded Republican primary in Georgia on Tuesday, fending off five challengers and surviving ongoing backlash over her controversial statements and behavior.
The 47-year-old political lightning rod leaned in to her national notoriety to raise millions for her first reelection bid and will now run in the general election to represent the safely Republican 11th Congressional District in the Peach State.
The incumbent held 70.4% of the vote when the race was called with 44% of precincts reporting, according to the Associated Press.

"A judge placed a roadblock on federal prosecutors conducting a criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of documents until a special master is appointed and has completed his or her work.
""The Court does not find that a temporary special master review under the present circumstances would cause undue delay"" to the investigation, said U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon of the Southern District of Florida, granting Trump's motion for a third-party review to look for privileged materials. She said the government is ""temporarily enjoined from further review..."
"President Donald Trump used a signing ceremony for a new North American trade agreement Wednesday to praise Republicans who have defended him during his impeachment trial – and inviting half the sitting GOP senators who are hearing his case.
With the full Senate meeting just hours later during a critical new phase of his impeachment trial, Trump made no effort to mask the power play he and his advisors orchestrated.
As he read through the list of 27 individual GOP senators invited to attend the event, Trump observed: 'Maybe I'm..."
"There’s only one thing not open on the southern border: media access to the operations of Customs and Border Protection. In a totalitarian effort at hiding the truth, the Biden administration has blocked the press.
Veteran photojournalist John Moore raised the alarm on Twitter over the weekend: “I respectfully ask US Customs and Border Protection to stop blocking media access to their border operations,” he wrote. “I have photographed CBP under Bush, Obama and Trump but now — zero access is granted to media. These long-lens images taken from the..."
"For two long years, Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez's Cuban medical team perpetrated a colossal deception of the Venezuelan people and the world about his bout with terminal cancer. According to knowledgeable sources, Cuban doctors botched the initial treatment that doomed Chavez, manipulated his anxiety and paranoia so he would settle for substandard medical care in Havana, and pushed him back on to the campaign trail despite the impact on his health."
"President Obama deferred deportation Friday for thousands of Liberians living in the U.S., allowing them to remain in America for two more years rather than return to their Ebola-stricken homeland.
In a presidential order, Mr. Obama extended the grant of “deferred enforced departure” for Liberians who have enjoyed safe haven status in the U.S. as far back as 1991, when their country was in the midst of a civil war.
Mr. Obama said there are “compelling foreign policy reasons” for his action; Liberia is one of three West African nations..."
"Republicans warned that only a small percentage of the American Rescue Plan was actually going toward Covid-19 relief, and that the rest is filled with pork, far-left policies, and bailouts—hence why it passed on a party-line vote. One provision in the $1.9 trillion legislation that’s now coming under scrutiny is the $86 billion bailout for failing pensions. As The New York Times reports, taxpayer money is going towards problems that existed prior to the pandemic: Tucked inside the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that cleared the Senate on Saturday is an..."
"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and several top Republicans on Monday laid out a set of proposals for members to follow when the full chamber does return to Washington, D.C., amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"The Trump administration notified the United Nations on Monday that it will formally withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, marking the first step in a one-year process to exit the global pact to fight climate change.
The move would leave the US as the only country outside the accord, a decision President Trump promised early in his term to unfetter America’s domestic oil, gas and coal industries.
“What we won’t do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters,” Trump said at a shale gas industry conference in..."

"Garry McCarthy was the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department. He was dismissed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel following the police shooting death of a young African-American male named Laquan McDonald. That shooting resulted in not only protests throughout the city, but also an investigation by the Department of Justice. Attorney General Loretta Lynch shared the agency's findings on Friday after a 13-month probe, but McCarthy predicted what she would say shortly before she even took the mic."
"Cyberattackers linked to a Chinese spy agency conducted a major ransomware attack against an American company, adding a new layer of complexity to a threat usually attributed to Russia, according to President Joe Biden’s administration.
""This was surprising to us,"" a senior administration official acknowledged in a media briefing Sunday on how China’s Ministry of State Security has emerged as a major cybersecurity threat. ""And, in fact, one of the reasons that we've put so much work into this attribution is because it really gave us new insights on the..."

"The Department of Justice will decrease the sentencing recommendation federal prosecutors made for Roger Stone, it announced on Tuesday, a few hours after President Donald Trump criticized the recommendation in a tweet.
“The Department was shocked to see the sentencing recommendation in the filing in the Stone case last night,” an unnamed senior Justice official told Fox News. “The sentencing recommendation was not what had been briefed to the Department.”
Federal prosecutors recommended that Stone should be sentenced to between 87 and 108 months in prison following his conviction on..."

Wen, a physician who was most recently a health commissioner in Baltimore, said the board voted to replace her at a “secret meeting,” even as they “were engaged in good faith negotiations about [her] departure based on philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood.”
According to the New York Times report this..."
"Ever wonder how social norms occur? Those that openly support the majority viewpoint on an issue are lauded so that behavior is reinforced. Dissenters, on the other hand, are denounced so they clam up for fear of being ostracized. This phenomenon is called the spiral of silence.
The spiral of silence theory is believed to be a function of evolution. Animals that are isolated from the herd don’t usually live very long. The same is true of humans. Safety in numbers is a core survival instinct reinforced by the brain’s..."
"President Donald Trump hurled more jabs at the ""fake news media"" Sunday morning, describing White House ""leaks"" as ""fabricated lies"" and saying stories with ""sources say"" make it ""very possible"" those ""sources don't exist"" and are made up by ""fake news writers."" Trump included all of this in a morning tweetstorm."
"A group of top scientists from around the globe has pushed back on the World Health Organization’s conclusion that it is “extremely unlikely” COVID-19 leaked from a Wuhan lab — insisting the theory is “viable” and deserves “a proper investigation.”

"Yesterday, Facebook’s stock tanked after it was revealed that they gave user data to a firm, Global Science Research (GSR), via an app. This data was then given to Cambridge Analytica, a firm that was working for Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The app not only gave GSR the data of the user who filled out the survey, but also that of all of the user’s friends without them knowing it. Some have noted a similar mining tool used by the Obama team, but they gathered information through their..."
"While the president is not on the ballot, midterm elections function largely as a referendum on his performance, which often means losses for the president’s party.

"Israel's security cabinet unanimously rejected U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's proposal for a temporary cease-fire in Gaza Friday, as bloody clashes continued between Israel and Islamic militants.
Kerry’s proposal called for a temporary truce to make time for Israel and Hamas to hold indirect talks about easing the border closure of the blockaded Gaza Strip. Hamas has demanded that Gaza's crossings be opened.
Israel TV reports that on Friday evening, Israel's Security Cabinet -- which groups top ministers on security issues -- rejected the proposal in its current form..."
"If there was a “hint” of truth to reports that Russian agents offered bounties to Afghan militants to kill U.S. soldiers, then President Trump should have been immediately informed on the matter, Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said Monday.

"Critics bashed ""NBC Nightly News"" Wednesday after the Peacock Network's flagship evening news program omitted key details from a report on the police-involved shooting of Ma'Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio.
Media Research Center news analyst Nicholas Fondacaro called out NBC News for editing out a portion of a frantic 911 call in which a woman is heard saying: ""It's these grown girls over here trying to fight us, trying to stab us, get here now!""
NBC did air a brief audio clip from the call in which the woman..."

"It's no secret that the media is often overtly in President Obama's corner, but it's still a little shocking to come across evidence of their efforts to make the Right look bad. Case in point: this clip that The Right Scoop found, which appears to feature reporters coordinating their efforts to trip up Mitt Romney during his press conference, after giving a statement on the violence in Libya. The transcript:"
"Once again, a sitting president of the United States has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but unlike last time, when President Barack Obama received the honor, current president Donald Trump has been nominated for an actual achievement, not just being popular in Europe and a nifty public speaker.
Last month, the Trump administration pulled off a massive deal between Israel and The United Arab Emirates in which the latter recognized the former and commercial air flights between the two began for the first time ever.
Back in 2009..."

We ask the public, elected officials and candidates to have..."
"According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Federal Trade Commission has approved a settlement under which Facebook will pay a record $5 billion fine for violating an FTC order regarding its privacy practices.
The settlement, which still needs Justice Department approval, shows that Facebook is finally getting a well-deserved punishment for abusing the privacy of those who use the service.
The Journal reported that the FTC hit Facebook with the $5 billion fine for violating a 2011 agreement that required the social media giant to notify users..."
"Before we even knew how the killer of 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, had obtained his guns, Chris Murphy was engaging in his customary performative emotionalism on the Senate floor, literally begging Republicans to “compromise.”
Compromise on what exactly? Murphy has never once offered a single proposal that would have deterred any of these mass shooters. Literally minutes after his routine, Murphy was asked about the obvious mental illness prevalent among most of these shooters. “Spare me the bullsh-t about mental illness,” the..."
"It’s been more than 75 years since the U.S. last faced an axis of strategic threats. Fortunately, that axis proved dysfunctional. Had it been otherwise, Japan and Germany would have systematically attacked the Soviet Union, not America, first.
Our current strategic adversaries, Russia and China, aren’t an axis. They’ve formed an entente, tighter today than any time since de-Stalinization split the communist world. Involving some mutual interests and objectives, displays of support, and coordination, ententes are closer than mere bilateral friendships but discernibly looser than full alliances. The pre-World War..."

"There is a class war going on inside the Democratic Party.
Consider these two cris de couer: Writing in the New York Times under the headline “America’s Cities Are Unlivable—Blame Wealthy Liberals,” Farhad Manjoo argues that rich progressives have, through their political domination of cities such as San Francisco, built an invisible wall by artificially constricting the supply of housing to keep prices up and the riff-raff down; writing in The Atlantic, Rahm Emanuel, the feckless former mayor of one of those unlivable cities, puts into prose a campaign rally..."

"While the incredible costs of the Biden administration's federal student loan forgiveness plan are widely known, yet another expense of the program is stirring controversy: maintaining the online application for loan forgiveness is expected to cost nearly $100 million annually.
This latest expense—not included in the Congressional Budget Office's recent estimate of the program's cost to taxpayers—is yet more evidence that sweeping student loan forgiveness will end up doing considerable economic harm.
In August, President Joe Biden announced a sweeping federal student loan forgiveness plan. Under the proposal, most borrowers making under $125,000 annually and married..."
"The U.S. economy added 210,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department reported Friday, far lower than the Dow Jones estimate of 573,000 jobs.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent, exceeding experts’ 4.5 percent prediction.
Leisure and hospitality added just 23,000 jobs last month after accounting for a significant amount of job growth for much of the economy’s recovery.
The report is based on surveys taken before the first cases of the omicron COVID-19 variant were detected in South Africa, but the report comes amid heightened concern that the..."
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton brushed aside emails Thursday that showed she privately told family and world leaders that the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi was a terrorist assault, and said Ambassador Christopher Stevens was responsible for his own decisions regarding skimpy security ahead of his death."
"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and White House officials traded Twitter blows this week, arguing taxes and inflation, political misdirection, and even the now-infamous Disinformation Governance Board.
It's the latest episode in an increasingly tense relationship between the Biden administration and one of Washington's most well-known part-time residents. Bezos owns the liberal-leaning Washington Post and the district's largest house and is building a second headquarters for Amazon across the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, but finds himself at odds with President Joe Biden, whom he blames for high inflation."

"Casey Mulligan, former chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), criticized the Biden administration for attempting to redefine what a recession constitutes.
Several underlying indicators suggest the U.S. is heading towards an economic downturn despite President Biden's insistence that the economy is strong, Mulligan — who served in the Trump administration between 2018 and 2019 — told FOX Business in an interview. In recent days, several top White House officials have downplayed the technical definition of a recession and argued that two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP)..."

"New unsealed FBI memos show that the Bureau found “no derogatory information” on former national security adviser Michael Flynn while investigating his alleged Russian contacts, and moved to close their investigation of him in early January 2017 before former FBI agent Peter Strzok intervened, asking to keep the case open.
The documents, which were released Thursday by the Department of Justice, show that Flynn was given the codename “Crossfire Razor” and investigated in a spinoff case predicated by the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” surveillance of the 2016 Trump campaign — a..."
"North Korea sent shock waves through the Trump administration’s hope for a history-making summit with Kim Jong-un, angrily canceling a planned meeting with South Korean officials Wednesday to protest joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises and calling into doubt President Trump’s announced meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore in less than a month."

Hodges, a same-sex marriage case whose outcome could have profound implications for the definition of marriage across America and the ability of states to handle the rules and regulations surrounding matrimony as they see fit.

"Is hydroxychloroquine a generally safe drug?
The politically charged atmosphere surrounding the drug in the context of COVID-19 can present a distorted picture. But the best evidence suggests that it has few adverse effects, although it does present some risks for patients with heart conditions.
Dr. Alieta Eck, who prescribed hydroxychloroquine for her patients who had COVID-19 symptoms, was confident the drug was safe.

"CNBC’s economic survey released prior to Christmas showed that for the first time in over a decade a majority was optimistic about the economy, and there was a shift as to who should receive credit for it: Donald J. Trump. The economic growth for the fourth quarter was near four percent. Over 100 companies gave bonuses of at least $1,000 or more to over a million workers, even some part-timers got a piece of that action. The GOP tax bill, which the Left said was going to be a prelude..."
"Low as our expectations were, President Biden still disappointed with his speech Thursday night.
We’re supposed to hope that if all goes well, we can gather with a few others outdoors to celebrate Independence Day? Sorry, sir, we can do that now. And Americans by the tens if not hundreds of millions are.
And in Texas, Florida and other states, they’ll be packing stadiums by Memorial Day — with precautions, sure. But half the country’s done with extreme cautions.

A section of the document is expected to include a specific admonition to Catholic politicians and other public figures who disobey church..."
"Recently-resurfaced audio from a speech that Mike Bloomberg gave about his law enforcement strategy as New York City mayor reveals that his support for the controversial “stop-and-frisk” program, which he has since disavowed due to it’s impact on minority communities, continued until as recently as 2015.
In an audio recording of his 2015 speech at the Aspen Institute, which was obtained by Fox News, Bloomberg can be heard saying that while it may be “controversial,” the way to stop murders is to seize guns from young minority males.

"Consumer spending accelerated in October as shoppers kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than usual due to the supply chain bottlenecks. 
Retail sales, a measure of spending at restaurants, stores and online, rose 1.7% last month, according to the Commerce Department. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting a 1.4% increase. The reading was 16.3% above year-ago levels. 
September’s reading was revised up by 0.1 percentage points to 0.8%.
""October retail sales growth was led by holiday-friendly categories such as nonstore retailers (e-commerce shops such as Amazon.com) and electronics stores,"" said Ted..."
"We're well aware that the prices for food and beverages at sporting events are offensively high, but this seems a bit much.
According to WatchDog.org, New Jersey governor Chris Christie spent nearly $83,000 on concessions at Jets and Giants games during the 2010 and 2011 season.
Let's say, hypothetically, that Christie attended every Jets and Giants home game for those two seasons. That's 32 games. Now let's divide that by $82,500. That comes out to $2,578 spent on concessions per game.

"Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled this past May, became teary-eyed as she recounted her sudden firing during a closed-door deposition last month, sources told Fox News.
That may have been the easy part.
On Friday morning at 9 a.m. ET, the 60-year-old diplomat will take the stand again for Day Two of the public impeachment hearings against President Trump -- and Republicans are set to hammer her with an aggressive cross-examination related to her previous statements under oath, as well as her reported role..."
"Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion isn’t going according to his script, and for that the world owes a great debt to the heroic people of that besieged country of 41 million. Their resistance against fearsome odds is an inspiration and has awakened the world to the menace of the Kremlin autocrat. Ukraine deserves more support to raise the costs of war for Mr. Putin with arms, the toughest sanctions, and global ostracism.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is proving to be the man for the moment as he rallies his country and..."
"Late Friday night, several tornadoes ripped through the Midwest, hitting the state of Kentucky the hardest, causing severe structural damage and taking the lives of at least 50 people in the Bluegrass State. On Saturday morning, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear announced he had declared a state of emergency and said the total death is expected to be between “70-100 people.”
“We are nearing the end of the most severe tornado event in Kentucky’s history,” Beshear said Saturday morning at a 4:00 am press conference. “Multiple tornadoes have touched down and we have..."
"The Senate on Wednesday passed a resolution that would block President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate for large private companies from taking place after two Democrats joined Republicans in backing the bill.
The joint resolution, brought by Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, passed 52-48 with the support of Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. It passed under the Congressional Review Act, a law that empowers the minority party in the Senate to force a vote of disapproval on a federal rule.

"County clerks in Nevada turned away gay couples eager to marry Wednesday amid a flurry of conflicting court decisions, including a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that blocked partners in Idaho moments before they would have picked up marriage licenses.
""I think I have whiplash,"" said Mary Baranovich who was a plaintiff in a Nevada court challenge to the state's gay marriage ban with Beverly Sevcik, her partner of 43 years.
A 9th Circuit ruling late Tuesday cleared the way for Idaho and Nevada to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Couples..."
"A New York grand jury on Tuesday declined to indict the officers involved in the death of Daniel Prude, a black man who died from asphyxiation while in police custody in March 2020.
""A grand jury has voted not to indict any police officer on charges related to the death of Daniel Prude,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote in a Twitter thread Tuesday afternoon. ""My office concluded there was sufficient evidence surrounding Mr. Prude’s death to present the case to a grand jury, and we presented the most..."
"To understand what ails Hillary Clinton, let’s rewind past Iowa and New Hampshire – two years back, in fact, to a speech in New Orleans before the National Auto Dealers Association and these words:
“The last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996. I remember it very well. Unfortunately, so does the Secret Service, which is why I haven't driven since then.”
That one passage underscores three of Clinton’s present-day woes: she’s lived in a cocoon for well over two decades; she’s not all that entertaining; there may..."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in a real-time Iowa State Fair straw poll Saturday, polling ahead of her by double digits, 52-41, according to the website of the Iowa secretary of state.
Though very unscientific, it did sustain the pace that Sanders is hitting in New Hampshire and other states, where he is gaining ground if not outright surpassing Clinton.
Specifically, more than 52 percent of Democrats who have cast a vote in the straw poll say they support Sanders. Just over 41 percent said they support Clinton. On..."
"COVID-19 vaccine-makers Pfizer and BioNTech announced Tuesday that they would test an omicron-specific vaccine candidate in healthy adults ages 18 to 55. 
The companies said there would be three trials examining different regimens of the current Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for an omicron-based vaccine.
The study will also draw upon some participants from the companies’ Phase 3 COVID-19 booster study, evaluating up to 1,420 people. 
The first cohort received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 90-180 days before enrollment and will receive one or two doses of the omicron-based vaccine. 
In the second, participants received three doses..."
"Leaders in the Western United States are scrambling to secure precious water supplies for their states and cities as they battle the worst drought conditions in 1,200 years with little, if any, relief on the horizon.
Irrigation districts in many parts of the Southwest are already warning farmers to expect less water from rivers such as the Rio Grande this year, even as demand has surged following months of below-average precipitation. And in the Pacific Northwest, experts are forecasting one of the driest summers on record, noting that more than 70% of the region is already considered to..."
"In one day, The New York Times called for the cancellation of Mount Rushmore and compared the United States to Nazi Germany. You read that right—as most Americans prepare for the Fourth of July weekend, the gray lady seems hellbent on dismantling the country by churning out sophomoric hot takes that would make even Brian Stelter blush.
The article detailing the sullied history of the Mount Rushmore monument suffers from precisely the same kind of omissions that spurred the paper to embark upon their 1619 Project. That project was meant..."
"Last week, President-elect Joe Biden announced that his incoming administration would not keep COVID-19 vaccines idling in freezers as boosters for folks who have already been inoculated with the first of two doses. Instead, his team would release all doses now and count on future production to provide the second doses in the coming weeks. This way, far more people could get some initial protection from the virus—a particularly timely consideration, as diagnosed COVID-19 cases have been soaring throughout the U.S. Additionally, it is urgent to get more Americans vaccinated..."
"A powerful magnitude 6.7 aftershock shook the Kathmandu region of Nepal sending people yelling and running Sunday, a day after a massive earthquake crippled the region killing more than 2,200.

""The aftershocks keep coming ... so people don't know what to expect,"" said Sanjay Karki, Nepal country head for global aid agency Mercy Corps. ""All the open spaces in Kathmandu are packed with people who are camping outdoors. When the aftershocks come you cannot imagine..."
"The New York City region awoke Thursday to debris-strewn downtowns, soggy basements and crippled transit after a “historic” overnight downpour from the remnants of Hurricane Ida killed at least eight people.
The storm dropped more than 5 inches of rain in Central Park in a three-hour period Wednesday. Newark, New Jersey, saw 8 inches, making it the wettest day on record.
Eight people ranging in age from 2 to 86 died in New York City, and a man in his 70s died in Passaic, New Jersey, after he was trapped..."
"The popular book “The 4-Hour Workweek” provides tips on how to make more money by working less. Now California Democrats are taking a page from the book by proposing to mandate a four-day week, which would require businesses to pay employees the same wages for less work. As labor economics goes, this is up there with paying people not to work and expecting more people to work.
A bill moving through the Legislature would shorten California’s normal workweek to 32 hours from 40 for companies with more than 500 employees...."
"WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats introduced a large police reform bill on Monday after kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds in memory of George Floyd, whose death sparked nationwide protests.
The “Justice in Policing Act of 2020” aims to increase transparency and limit abuses after unrest over Floyd’s May 25 death when Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck until he died.
“The martyrdom of George Floyd gave the American experience a moment of national anguish as we grieve for the black Americans killed by police brutality,” House..."
"The first-and-only Kentucky Senate debate this season sparked fireworks Monday, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell charging that Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes intends to further President Obama's agenda and Grimes accusing the five-term incumbent of being a selfish Washington insider."
"The House on Friday passed a budget resolution, mounting a key procedural hurdle and clearing a path for Congress to pass President Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.
The Senate passed the budget resolution earlier on Friday in a 51-50 vote along party lines, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.
Democrats plan to use a process called budget reconciliation to pass the hefty relief bill, which allows the legislation to be approved and sent to Biden’s desk with a simple majority of votes, rather than the..."
"There is no longer any doubt that Donald Trump will be close to clinching the nomination by the time he arrives in Cleveland and that only an orchestrated party effort will be able to stop him.
That’s why the debate has been gradually shifting to whether Trump can be deprived of the nomination without blowing the party to smithereens.
Trump emerged from Super Duper Tuesday in a commanding position after taking Florida, knocking Marco Rubio out of the race. Rubio was a press favorite who never quite ma"
"A vote for me is a vote for jobs, safety, rule of law, lower taxes, protection of your Second Amendment, and freedom.
Four years ago, Americans elected me president to go to Washington, drain the swamp and produce real results for them. Now they have a choice: continue the record of prosperity that my administration delivered or return to the old Washington status quo, where Beltway insiders enriched themselves at the expense of hardworking Americans across the country.
My administration has delivered safety, prosperity and opportunity for all Americans..."
"Sales of new U.S. homes plunged more than expected in July to the lowest level in six years as rising mortgage rates and the relentless increase in home values slowed activity by edging prospective homebuyers out of the market. 
New single-family home purchases tumbled 12.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 511,000 units, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. It marked the sixth consecutive month of declines. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv expected new home sales – which account for a small percentage of total sales – to fall 2.5% last month...."
"The Taliban released Navy veteran Mark Frerichs in a prisoner exchange for an Afghan tribal leader with ties to the Taliban on Monday, ending Frerichs's captivity after two years.
The exchange occurred at Kabul airport, where Frerichs was swapped for Bashir Noorzai, the Afghan leader who had been imprisoned in the United States for allegedly smuggling more than $50 million worth of heroin into the U.S. and Europe.
“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is ready to solve problems by negotiation with all including the United States,” acting Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said at..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled 6-2 for Google in its copyright fight with Oracle.
At issue were more than 11,000 lines of computer code, which Oracle claimed Google stole. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion that said Google’s copying was a “fair use” of Oracle’s computer code, which he said the justices assumed was capable of being copyrighted.
Justice Breyer wrote: “Several features of Google’s copying suggest that the better way to look at the numbers is to take into account the several..."
"The Department of Justice announced Thursday that it filed a lawsuit against Texas, targeting a state law that proponents say aims to make elections more secure.
Senate Bill 1 was signed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in early September, establishing new rules for mail-in voting while increasing the number of partisan poll watchers and giving the state more control over local voting operations.
""Our democracy depends on the right of eligible voters to cast a ballot and to have that ballot counted,"" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement. ""The Justice Department will continue to use..."
"The Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Monday, not that you would know it if you watched any of the Sunday shows. Despite the culmination of the highly publicized veepstakes succeeding in roiling media praise and a massive fundraising haul, Joe Biden and his newly announced running mate Kamala Harris have taken an unusually guarded approach to campaign coverage, even in the midst of a global pandemic forcing much of normal campaigning to go virtual.
Biden's campaign strategy since locking down the nomination through waiting for the general..."
"It was inevitable that when speaking for 8 straight hours on the House floor, Nancy Pelosi would spout some crazy nonsense. But I was not prepared for what only can be called a depraved celebration of racial self-hatred. The muddled state of her thinking was on display when she spoke praise of her grandson wishing he were not white. Tucker Carlson (video below) captured the pathetic nature of her celebration of racial self-hatred when she said:"
"FBI Director James Comey cautioned against believing reporting on classified information, which he said oftentimes gets the facts wrong.
During his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, Comey went out of his way to caution against lending too much credibility on reporting of classified information."
"The Senate passed veteran healthcare legislation Tuesday after a contentious delay brought about by a group of Republican senators blocking the bill over a budget measure.
The measure passed by a vote of 86-11, a bipartisan supermajority easily exceeding the 60-vote threshold to clear a filibuster. President Joe Biden hailed the passage of the ""biggest expansion of benefits for service-connected health issues in 30 years and the largest single bill ever to comprehensively address exposure to burn pits"" in a statement issued by the White House afterward.
""I look forward to signing this bill, so that veterans and their families..."
"On Tuesday evening, President Joe Biden traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to participate in a CNN Presidential Town Hall — his first as President of the United States. Speaking with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, Biden fielded questions from audience members, some of whom voted for him and some of whom did not.
In a similar fashion to Biden’s television appearances while on the campaign trail, and the first days of his administration, the town hall event was dripping with falsehoods and misleading arguments.
Here is a breakdown of some such statements..."
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom will keep his job steering the nation's most populous state.
A majority of Californians have voted no - meaning against removing Newsom from office - in Tuesday's recall election of the embattled first-term Democratic governor.
Newsom, who was overwhelmingly elected governor in 2018 in the heavily blue state, was facing a recall drive sparked last year mainly over accusations that he mishandled his state’s response to the coronavirus, the worst pandemic to strike the globe in a century.
The governor, who cruised to major victory, said soon after the Associated Press projected..."

"On Monday evening, protesters in St. Louis who chaotically clashed with police over the shooting of an unarmed black resident jumped on a reporter's car and threw a ""blood-like substance"" on the hood.
New York Times reporter Julie Bosman, who covers the region, said they apologized after realizing she ""wasn't police."" Confrontations between police and residents have intensified after Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot to death by a cop over the weekend. The FBI is now investigating the shooting."
"The Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) still has not reported official vote totals in the critical Iowa caucuses as of early Tuesday morning, in a largely unexplained and unprecedented delay that has raised questions about the legitimacy of the contest -- and Democratic campaign officials are livid, Fox News has learned.
The Trump campaign, meanwhile, openly suggested that the delay meant that the caucuses were being ""rigged,"" and that the embarrassing night proved that the Democratic Party can't be trusted to run Americans' health care and implement sweeping new government programs...."
"The White House said Sunday that President Trump didn’t hear someone shouting “white power” in a now-deleted retweet of a pro-Trump rally in Florida.
“He did not hear the one statement made on the video. What he did see was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.
The president had retweeted the video early Sunday showing a parade of Trump supporters in golf carts outfitted with “Trump 2020” and “Make America Great Again” signs in The Villages, a retirement community in central Florida near Orlando."
"President Donald Trump officially jumps into the 2020 presidential race today with an event in Orlando, Florida. But if recent polling holds true, he has a lot of ground to make up. Former Vice President Joe Biden not only leads the Democratic field, but he holds a 10-point advantage over the president.
""I believe we can win Texas and Florida if you look at the polling data now,"" Biden said at an event in DC on Monday.

"Democratic lawmakers are set to unveil legislation Thursday to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court.
Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Reps. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Hank Johnson, D-Ga., and Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., will hold a press conference on Thursday to introduce the proposal on the steps of the Supreme Court.
Given their control of the White House and the Senate, the legislation could allow them to supersede the current conservative majority by ""packing"" the Court with liberal justices."
"The Uvalde school board voted unanimously on Wednesday night to immediately fire police chief Pete Arredondo over the disastrous response to the shooting at Robb Elementary earlier this year that resulted in the deaths of 19 children.
The disgraced police chief refused to attend the meeting because he was scared for his safety.
The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District had already recommended that Arredondo be fired.

"China said Friday that it will stop accepting deportees from the U.S. as part of its retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‘s visit this week to Taiwan.
The move was among nine steps announced by China‘s Foreign Affairs Ministry, along with ending cooperation on transnational crime and drugs, and halting talks on climate change.
It also raises the stakes for the Biden administration, which under U.S. law can punish countries that refuse to cooperate on deportations by refusing to issue new visas to that country’s citizens.
That decision belongs to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas...."
"A top American general says that 100 would-be militants have already left small Caribbean countries to fight with Islamic State extremists in Syria – and could potentially get across the US border when they return home.

He said that small Caribbean nations – such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname – as well as Venezuela are concerned about the militants returning home to conduct terror operations because..."

"Vice President Kamala Harris accused Russia Thursday of committing “atrocities of unimaginable proportion” in Ukraine — while warning the US will “defend every inch of NATO territory” if the war was to spread.
Harris made the commitment while also saying that Russia “absolutely” should be investigated for war crimes amid scenes of “atrocities of unimaginable proportion” during three weeks of his “unjustified” invasion.
“What is at stake at this very moment are some of the guiding principles around the NATO alliance,” Harris said after meeting Polish President Andrzej Duda in..."

"Democrats cannot include a $15 minimum wage mandate in their COVID-19 spending package, the Senate parliamentarian ruled Thursday.
Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough rejected arguments by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders that a minimum wage increase conformed to special rules allowing the Senate to pass the COVID-19 spending package with only 51 votes, a source familiar told the Washington Examiner.
Democrats can try to vote to overrule MacDonough with a majority vote, but some lawmakers in their own party would likely object."
"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Kim Kardashian $1.26 million for promoting a cryptocurrency asset without disclosing being paid to promote it.
Kardashian promoted EthereumMax tokens on her Instagram account without disclosing that she had been paid $250,000 to post about the cryptocurrency. The influencer agreed to settle with the SEC over the action but did not admit to or deny the regulator's allegations in settling the case.

"Addressing the media at a press conference Tuesday in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid promised that the country’s women would embrace sharia law, the strict Islamic fundamentalist moral code the militant organization subscribes to and enforces for citizens.

The group’s representative indicated that the rights of women will be recognized and respected under Taliban reign, insisting that nobody should be “worried about our norms and..."
"resident Trump on Saturday night strongly denied a report that he had taken unusual steps to hide the details of his private conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2017 in Hamburg, Germany, telling Fox News in an exclusive interview that he had followed typical protocols in the wake of other high-profile leaks of his sensitive communications with foreign leaders."
"Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 in prison Tuesday for her role in helping powerful pedophile Jeffrey Epstein abuse young girls, capping off a dramatic fall from grace for the British socialite turned-convicted sex-trafficker.
US District Judge Alison Nathan said the sentence of 240 months was “sufficient and not greater than necessary,” for Maxwell, who earlier addressed the court and told victims in a half-hearted apology, “I am sorry for the pain that you experienced.”
As she finally learned her fate, the 60-year-old predator’s face remained inscrutable, and she briefly hugged her..."

"Top Democrats are tamping down calls from liberal lawmakers to impeach Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for not recusing himself from cases related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
That despite text messages showing his wife pushing then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to fight to overturn the presidential election results.
Democrats have voiced strong concerns that Ginni Thomas’s correspondences with conservative lawmakers' offices and Meadows ahead of the riot pose a conflict of interest, with a growing number arguing Clarence Thomas should step aside in cases pertaining to the 2020 election.

"The Supreme Court has agreed to expedite and hear procedural elements of two challenges to Texas' new anti-abortion law, which effectively bans most abortions after six weeks.
One case is the Department of Justice's challenge against the Texas law, and the other is by an organization called Whole Women's Health. 
The questions presented in each case are procedural in nature and will not get to the merits of the Texas law or whether to potentially overturn the major abortion precedent Roe v. Wade. "
"Tax Day is a particularly dreary and unpleasant ""holiday"" this year. Americans who trudge down to the post office to drop off their returns or simply push a button to file electronically are aware that the IRS itself confesses that is it behind in processing those returns it already has by roughly 22 million.
Taxpayers are to hurry up (or be fined) and get in a long line. If you have last-minute questions about the tax form it is not cheerful to read that the IRS admits it is answering no..."
"Moscow dismissed accusations that it was behind the alleged Tuesday sabotage of Nord Stream energy pipelines as ""stupid and absurd"" Wednesday.
Accusations have flown after three unprecedented leaks sprang from the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines at the bottom of the Baltic Sea on Monday.

"President Joe Biden has bluntly called Vladimir Putin a ""killer"" and said he ""doesn't have a soul.""
While he may have used robust language in the past, he is playing his cards closer to his chest ahead of the showdown with his Russian counterpart in an 18th-century Swiss villa overlooking Lake Geneva.
Landing in the U.K. last week, Biden told cheering throngs of U.S. Air Force personnel he planned to “meet with Mr. Putin to let him know what I want him to know.”

"A federal judge in San Francisco restored a nationwide injunction on Monday preventing the Trump administration’s ban on asylum-seekers who travelled through a so-called safe third country before arriving in the U.S.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar issued the ruling after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August narrowed his previous nationwide injunction, allowing the Trump administration to implement the asylum-rule change in Texas and New Mexico but not in California or Arizona.
In response to an overwhelming surge in asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border,..."
"Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, perhaps more than any other Supreme Court justices in modern history, are closely connected to the president who appointed them. Gorsuch got his seat after Republicans stonewalled the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and then Trump unexpectedly prevailed in the 2016 election. And any other president probably would have withdrawn his nominee after Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations, but Trump dug deep, and Kavanaugh crossed the finish line. That past cannot be erased, but a new prologue is being written. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh know full well..."
"Liberals were dealt their first major disappointments of President Biden’s young administration as the United States launched airstrikes in Syria and the prospects for a $15 federal minimum wage dimmed.
“We didn’t flip Georgia Blue for Biden to air strike Syria,” left-wing activist Ja’Mal Green tweeted. “We flipped Georgia Blue for our $2,000 Stimulus Checks.”

Joe Biden got zero boost from the Democrats’ grievance-fueled slog-fest last week. The Democratic presidential nominee's polls did not move higher; in fact, they dropped, and especially in the critical swing states."
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders shelved the niceties and went right after each other’s perceived weak spots at a must-win Democratic primary debate Thursday night where the front-runner challenged her rival’s grasp of complex policy issues – and the insurgent senator hammered her as a Wall Street pal just now talking the talk of working Americans.
"America is locking down again. In some places, that's already happening. If you have kids, you've seen it. Joe Biden has promised more of it -- more masks, more quarantines, more limits on travel, more restrictions on who you can eat with and who you can touch.
The most intimate details of our lives are being completely controlled by our leadership class. The people who used to scream at politicians, ""Keep your hands off my body!"" aren't saying a thing about this. In fact, they're encouraging it."
"Ever wondered what all the social justice positions would look like if rolled into one comprehensive social engineering document? That's the Great Reset, spearheaded by the World Economic Forum. The WEF wants to use the blunt force trauma of the pandemic to force the world to reshape according to socialist dictates.
The coronavirus crisis has been used as a reason to put together a social justice wish list that would be enacted by multi-national and governments to tackle everything from climate change to corporate equity."
"President Biden on Friday will sign a sweeping new executive order aimed at cracking down on anti-competitive behavior by Big Tech and other sectors including labor, health care and financial services.
Comprised of 72 actions and recommendations, the order is intended to promote competition in the U.S. economy by encouraging more than a dozen federal agencies to scrutinize corporate mergers and other ways that a growing number of companies build their outside market power, according to a White House fact sheet. "
"This week, The New York Times ran an op-ed by United States Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urging that the military be used to quell the fires, looting and violence gripping the nation’s cities.
A Morning Consult poll from this week found that 58 percent of registered voters agreed with that idea. But apparently it’s an opinion forbidden in the Times.
Black staffers at the paper said the column made them feel unsafe. The day after it ran, the paper folded like, well, The New York Times, and apologized for it...."
"A House oversight hearing Friday laid bare the sheer complexity of dealing with the global Ebola epidemic, as lawmakers toggled between the desperate plight in West Africa and concern that flawed policies have put Americans’ at risk on their own shores.
Rep. Darrell Issa, California Republican and the chamber’s top investigator, repeatedly questioned the Obama administration’s ability to track the virus and guide local officials through the fight.

"President Joe Biden will host George Floyd’s family at the White House this week to mark a year since Floyd was killed while in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department, sparking the national anti-racism and anti-police brutality movement.
Biden will not, however, meet his stated deadline for passing the Geroge Floyd Justice in Policing Act by May 25th, amid concerns that the existing draft measure does not have “teeth.”

"President Obama Wednesday tapped the acting director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy, to lead the embattled agency on a permanent basis, ignoring calls for an outsider to take over.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Clancy has “a lot of important work ahead of him.” He said the president believes Mr. Clancy is “the right person for the job,” has shown a willingness “to look at needed reforms.”
Mr. Clancy was appointed on an interim basis last year after then-Director Julia Pierson was"
"Arkansas lawmakers on Monday passed first of its kind legislation that would prevent doctors from offering puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones or gender-transition surgery to minors.
Under the measure, any healthcare professional who offers such services would be in danger of losing their medical license and open to lawsuits from patients who later come to regret their procedures.
Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson has not yet revealed whether he will sign the bill into law.
“The governor will review the bill more closely, listen to the debate, study it and make a..."
"President Biden grew irked Friday with repeated press questions about the Afghanistan troop drawdown, saying he didn't want to answer any more on the topic because it was a holiday weekend.
Following remarks on a positive June jobs report, Biden took multiple questions about the situation in Afghanistan, where the country faces a possible fall to the Taliban as U.S. forces are withdrawn. After receiving questions on the nation's security issues and the withdrawal timeline, Biden said he wanted to talk about ""happy things.""

"A new poll of citizens in Mexico says that a majority are against the entrance of migrants from Central America to their country on their way to seek asylum in the United States.
The poll from the Washington Post and Reforma, a leading Mexican newspaper, found that nearly two thirds of Mexicans polled, 64 percent, said that migrants were a ""burden"" that took jobs and benefits away from their citizens.
The issue has become more contentious for Mexican nationals after President Donald Trump began a new policy of..."

"To repay African Americans in California for the “ongoing and compounding harms” of slavery, a state task force on June 1 recommended lawmakers create 10 new offices to oversee reparations.
The interim report (pdf) by the California Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans—about 500 pages long—describes the harms slavery inflicted on African Americans and its “lingering effects on American society today.”
One of the new state offices recommended in the report would be designed to help black Californians file for monetary reparations, while another office would help prove..."
"Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday called for more government spending to support the nation’s nascent economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Both the central bank and Congress should continue their aggressive efforts to shore up the economy even though employment, consumer spending and other key measures have rebounded from their collapse in the spring, Powell argued in a virtual speech to the National Association for Business Economics.
The risks of policymakers “overdoing it” with stimulus are fairly small, Powell said, but providing too little support would weaken the..."
"Joe Biden isn’t having a great presidency.
His approval ratings are poor: 43.4% of voters approve of the job he is doing, while 51.6% of them disapprove, according to FiveThirtyEight. The Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster. Inflation is high. Businesses are having a hard time filling jobs. The coronavirus isn’t going away. Biden hasn’t been able to get many of his campaign promises done, including his ""Build Back Better"" agenda. And his administration has taken some divisive positions, such as support for repealing the Hyde Amendment that protects taxpayers from funding elective abortion.
So what can Biden do if..."
"Victims of sexual assault and harassment soon will no longer be forced to rely on an independent arbiter to settle their cases, following the Senate’s passage of a bill to end such practices on Thursday.
The Senate approved by voice vote a bill that would end forced arbitration in sexual misconduct cases, just two days after it had passed the House, 335-97. All opposing votes came from Republicans.
“This is one of the most significant workplace reforms in American history,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, New York Democrat. “No longer will..."
"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged world leaders to increase taxes on coal, oil, and natural gas companies in order to mitigate the cost of climate change and provide relief from inflation.
“Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,” Guterres said Tuesday. “Those funds should be redirected in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis, and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.”"

"Children ages 5 to 11 will be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine at their doctor’s office, pharmacy and potentially even their school as soon as it is authorized by US drug regulators, the White House said Wednesday.
The Biden administration said it had obtained enough Pfizer shots to inoculate all 28 million children in that age range – as they outlined their plans to roll out the vaccine pending authorization.
Under the plan, the Pfizer vaccine would be distributed to children in smaller doses and with smaller needles, officials said."
"President-elect Joe Biden stuck to his policy agenda rather than get distracted by impeachment politics through his unveiling of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus proposal on Thursday.

"A serious threat could hurt the Republican Party's chances of gaining more Senate seats this November. It's called bad candidates.
The Republican Party is in a favorable position. It's a midterm election, and Democratic President Joe Biden has a horrible (39.5%) approval rating, according to FiveThirtyEight. Also, the Senate is split 50-50.
In theory, Republicans should have no problem winning back the Senate, netting three or four seats. However, that probably won't happen.
The party may end up nominating several bad candidates, some of whom may cost it winnable seats.

"The Pentagon on Friday announced it is canceling all border wall construction projects that were paid for by military funding -- part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to cancel the Trump-era barrier.
Biden issued an executive order in January halting all construction projects related to the wall so that a review could take place. More than 450 miles had been built during the Trump administration and approximately 350 miles was already funded -- some of that with money diverted from the Defense Department."
"Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic presidential nomination, but you wouldn’t know from President Biden’s first two months in office. First came $1.9 trillion in social spending under the cover of Covid-19, and now comes $2.3 trillion more for climate and political spending dressed as “infrastructure.”
Most Americans think of infrastructure as roads, highways, bridges and other traditional public works. That’s why it polls well, and every President has supported more of it.
Yet this accounts for a mere $115 billion of Mr. Biden’s proposal. There’s another..."
"Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Tuesday that he is initiating a 30-day review of how the Justice Department can combat hate crime.
In a memo to DOJ employees obtained by Fox News, Garland cited the department’s history as well as current trends in criminal activity to illustrate why he believes such a move is necessary.

"A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted against green-lighting COVID-19 booster shots Friday for most people — throwing up a major hurdle for President Biden’s plan to dole out a third dose to most Americans.
But the independent panel, which reviewed a 23-page FDA briefing document highlighting recent studies,  recommended emergency use of a third dose for Americans over age 65 and those at high risk of severe infection.
The panel said more data is needed before it can okay boosters for people ages 16 and older, and that the..."

AdImpact also found that $534 million has been spent on gubernatorial general races alone, with Democratic candidates spending more than independents and Republicans. Republicans have spent a coordinated $35 million, compared to Democrats' $6 million."
"Rep. Doug Collins said Wednesday on ""America's Newsroom"" that he has a lengthy list of questions to ask former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has now agreed to testify next month before two House committees.
Collins, R-Ga., the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, told Sandra Smith that his questions will center around how the investigation into the Trump campaign began in 2016, how Mueller chose his team of investigators and when Mueller's team came to the conclusion that there was ""no collusion or conspiracy"" between the campaign and Russia."

"Former President Donald Trump told conservatives gathered in Texas that senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) will pay the ultimate political price for backing a $739 billion bill investing heavily in green energy.
Trump made the remarks during a speech to an audience of some 5,000 attendees as the final speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas on Saturday.

"President Obama has abandoned his pledge to reform U.S. immigration policy by the end of summer and will instead wait until after the November congressional elections, The Associated Press reports Saturday.
Obama concluded that using executive action to circumvent Congress during the campaign season would politicize the issue and future hurt efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
The decision is welcome news for Democratic senators trying to win reelection in conservative states -- and help their party fend off a strong GOP effort to take control of the"
"Conservative Republicans said Wednesday that they don’t believe their chamber will tackle an immigration bill this year, saying that while they welcomed the House GOP leaders’ principles as a start to a conversation, it’s premature to try to pass a bill.

"Inflation might be even more explosive than Fourth of July fireworks this year as families grapple with pricier cookouts and holiday plans.
The cost of a July Fourth cookout is expected to be 17% higher than last year, according to a market basket survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation. That is a number that outpaces headline inflation, as prices on average are 8.6% higher from a year ago, according to the consumer price index.

"According to Fox News' recent report, President Obama's unilateral executive amnesty could drop as early as this week. The president had indicated that he'd give Congress some time to conform to his will before unleashing this extraordinary power grab, but perhaps that timeline has shifted for some reason.

"The Louisiana state legislature failed to garner enough votes to override the Democratic governor John Bel Edwards’ veto of a bill that would prohibit transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports.
The Republican-controlled Louisiana House secured 68 votes, with 30 lawmakers voting against, falling two short of the 70 needed to overturn the veto and enact the legislation. Republicans only hold 68 out of 105 seats in the House chamber, so Democratic votes would have been needed to meet the benchmark, according to The Advocate."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put the ambitious plan to create jobs and improve the environment to a vote to force Democrats to take a public stand on the measure and try to divide the party’s moderates and progressives.
The final vote was 57 against and no one for the plan, with 43 Democrats voting present.

"Conversations! Glorious conversations! What more can you ask for?
The other day, former CBS News darling Katie Couric was speaking at an event organized by something called ""TheWrap."" Specifically, at its ""Power Women Breakfast"" in New York. (That is exactly the kind of event I'd expect Couric to be at, and I don't even know what it is.)
She was asked about the scandal swirling around her anti-gun-documentary — specifically, the fact that she deceptively edited a gun rights group's response to a question to make the members seem like..."
"Katie Couric’s 2014 documentary Fed Up includes instances of deceptive editing similar to 2016’s Under the Gun, according to several people familiar with the making of the film.
Fed Up, which focuses on obesity and the food industry, was directed by Stephanie Soechtig and produced by Couric. The film includes two interviews with figures who hold viewpoints counter to the narrative of the film, and sources say both interviews include at least one misleading or deceptive edit intended to embarrass the interviewee.
Dr. David Allison, an interview subject in the..."
"A 40-year political career came to a close after Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie lost his bid for a second term in a stunning primary-election defeat by a fellow Democrat and state senator who defied party leadership to challenge the incumbent. A second intraparty fight for U.S. Senate was too close to call.
State Sen. David Ige, once seen as an underdog, cruised to a decisive 35 percentage point win in Saturday's primary after being dramatically outspent by Abercrombie, who also had high-profile endorsements including President Barack Obama. Ige said his..."
"President Joe Biden, 78, received a booster shot against COVID-19 at the White House on Monday afternoon, days after the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that seniors who had gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine more than six months ago should get them. 
Biden’s booster dose comes after the CDC endorsed Pfizer booster shots for those 65 and over and those in long-term care, as well as for people between 50 and 64 with underlying medical conditions. The CDC’s booster endorsement does not cover those who received the Moderna or Johnson..."
"The vanguard of the revolution has set its beady-eyed gaze on . . . Paw Patrol.
Paw Patrol, a children’s cartoon about doggie do-gooders, has as one of its principal characters a German shepherd called Chase, who is a police officer. (A police officer in an imaginary universe in which dogs have full-time jobs, drive cars, and wear jaunty caps.) According to the New York Times, which just fired its opinion editor for publishing opinions, Paw Patrol has run afoul of the new commandment: Thou shalt not make sympathetic depictions..."
President Trump did not fail to deliver the goods to his Western Pennsylvania supporters when he made a rabble rousing speech Saturday evening that plugged both his economic accomplishments and his support for state representative Rick Saccone in his quest to win Tuesday’s special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
"In an address to the nation exactly 24 hours after he abruptly ended a chaotic evacuation of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, a defensive and at times surly President Biden insisted the bug-out was an “extraordinary success,” despite the stranding of hundreds of American citizens and thousands of Afghan allies.
“As we close 20 years of war and strife and pain and sacrifice, it’s time to look to the future, not the past,” Biden said near the end of a 26-minute speech that was delivered in strident, occasionally angry tones and echoed earlier remarks justifying his decision..."
"China will renew its military drills around Taiwan after a delegation of U.S. lawmakers made a surprise visit to the self-governed Island, China announced Monday.
Five members of Congress landed in Taiwan on Sunday, less than two weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi outraged China with her own visit. Pelosi's visit triggered China to hold unprecedented military drills surrounding Taiwan. Those drills will now be renewed in reaction to the second Congressional delegation.
The five members of Congress include Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass, and Reps. John Garamendi, D-Calif; Alan Lowenthal, D-Calif.; Don Beyer,..."
"It has been a year and a half since former President Trump left the White House, but the results from the latest round of primaries proves that his immense grip over the Republican Party remains firm.
While the biggest headline from Tuesday’s primaries in five states was the resounding victory in Kansas for abortion rights activists – in the first ballot box test of legalized abortion since the blockbuster June decision by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling – candidates backed by Trump came out on top..."
"Texas has joined Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Tennessee in passing laws to ban public schools from teaching critical race theory (CRT). Other states, such as Florida, have done so through executive rulemaking. This is a positive first step towards reclaiming American education from openly anti-American pedagogy.
The intellectual roots of CRT can be found in Marxist-influenced critical theory, which began in the academia of Weimar Germany. It developed into an “intersectional” ideology at Harvard Law School in the late 1980s, through Kimberlé Crenshaw and other supporters of Professor Derrick Bell. In recent years, however, it..."
"Social distancing is a luxury you don’t have aboard a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. So a word about Thursday’s firing of a Navy officer who showed up in the news asking for help containing a coronavirus outbreak on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt.
Many have been quick to lionize Capt. Brett Crozier as a hero who spoke up in defense of his crew. His March 30 four-page letter, which leaked to the press this week, said he urgently needed to offload some 4,000 deployed sailors to quarantine in Guam to..."
"The economy will grow in 2021 at its fastest rate in 17 years as vaccines are administered across the country and life returns to normal, the Congressional Budget Office projected Monday.
The CBO expects that the U.S. gross domestic product will continue to expand ""rapidly over the coming year, reaching its previous peak in mid-2021 and surpassing its potential level in early 2025,"" with an anticipated annual growth rate of 2.6% over the next five years.
Annual growth is expected to hit 3.7% in 2021, which would be the strongest..."
"Theresa May announced Friday that she will step down as U.K. Conservative Party leader on June 7, admitting defeat in her attempt to take Britain out of the European Union and sparking a contest to become the country’s next prime minister.
She will stay as caretaker prime minister until the new leader is chosen, a process likely to take several weeks. The new Conservative leader will become prime minister without the need for a general election, and will take up the task of trying to secure Britain’s exit from the..."
"Young Kim was poised to become the first Korean-American woman elected to Congress. Her 14-point lead was the lone bright spot on an otherwise dismal night for Orange County Republicans. But, over the past week, Republicans have watched the first-generation immigrant’s lead evaporate. With thousands of provisional ballots left to count, her commanding lead is now underwater. She lost one week after the election.
There’s no evidence of ballot box shenanigans. No need. Democrats know it’s easier to erode voter integrity laws than to stuff ballot boxes."
"A week after the FDA approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, the agency has granted the same approval for Moderna's vaccine. In clinical trials, Moderna's candidate was over 94 percent effective.
On Thursday night, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted 20-0 to recommend the vaccine be made available.
""The evidence that has been studied in great detail on this vaccine highly outweighs any of the issues we’ve seen,"" said Dr. Hayley Gans of Stanford University Medical Center.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday that the..."

Urgent: Should Obamacare Be Repealed? Vote Here Now!"
"A defiant Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urged Greeks on Wednesday to reject an international bailout deal, wrecking any prospect of repairing broken relations with EU partners before a referendum on Sunday that may decide Greece's future in Europe.
Less than 24 hours after he wrote a conciliatory letter to creditors asking for a new bailout that would accept many of their terms, Tsipras abruptly switched back into combative mode in a television address.
Greece was being ""blackmailed,"" he said, quashing talk that he might delay the vote, call it off..."
"U.S. job growth unexpectedly accelerated in July, defying fears of a slowdown in hiring even as the labor market confronts the twin threats of scorching-hot inflation and rising interest rates.
Employers added 528,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, blowing past the 250,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged down to 3.5%, the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic began more than two years ago."
"President Obama’s deputy national security adviser on Monday defended the new interim deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, saying that the United States will “continue to confront” the Islamic Republic and that pressure on the country is “not going away.”
Tony Blinken, the White House aide, told CNN’s “New Day” that he understands why Israel is skeptical, since an Iranian bomb “would present an existential threat” to the country."
"President Donald Trump claims that he’s taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against contracting coronavirus, and that he has taken zinc and antibiotic azithromycin as well.
There’s no consensus that hydroxychloroquine is an effective therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 (early studies have yielded different results, and the NIH recently began a controlled clinical trial). Few people I’ve read argue that it’s a useful prophylactic. Nevertheless, the frenzied and childish reaction to Trump’s championing what amounts to a commonly used prescription drug is more destructive than his annoying habit of bringing it..."
"At least six people were killed and 21 injured during shootings in and around the cities of Odessa and Midland, Texas, Saturday.
A gunman, identified as a white male in his mid-30s, was shot and killed by police in Odessa.
Police originally believed two suspects were at large, with one driving a hijacked mail truck and ""shooting at random people,"" while the other was thought to be driving a ""gold/white small Toyota truck."" However, police now believe there was only one gunman in a gold Honda who at one..."
"Millions of California residents could receive payments up to $1,050.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Sunday that he and the state's legislative leaders have agreed on a framework for the 2022-2023 state budget, which includes stimulus payments to help residents deal with rising inflation and gas prices.
""California's budget addresses the state's most pressing needs, and prioritizes getting dollars back into the pockets of millions of Californians who are grappling with global inflation and rising prices of everything from gas to groceries,"" Newsom said in a press statement on Sunday. ""The centerpiece of the agreement, a $17..."
"GOP front-runner Donald Trump on Friday night followed up a Twitter assault on rival Ted Cruz with a barrage of insults at a campaign event in Iowa, appearing to signal an end to his friendly relationship with the Senator from Texas.
But on Saturday morning, the billionaire New York real estate developer tried to downplay the unpleasantness, saying he was ""having a little fun with Ted"" at the rally.
""We have had a very good relationship,"" Trump told Fox News' ""Fox and Friends Weekend"" on Saturday. ""I'm sure it will..."
"A Big Tech-backed “fact” “checking” outfit claimed to debunk explosive evidence in support of Republicans’ claims of significant election problems at a Thursday Georgia Senate hearing. It didn’t. Not even close.
Newly discovered security footage from Georgia’s State Farm Arena showed dozens of ballot counters, media, and Republican observers leaving en masse at the same time from the ballot-counting area for Fulton County. After they left, a small remnant of about four workers began pulling trunks containing thousands of ballots from underneath a table with a long tablecloth and running..."
"The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration acted within its authority when it expanded exemptions to the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) requirement for employers to provide insurance coverage that includes contraception -- in a victory for Little Sisters of the Poor, the Catholic group that has been at the center of the national debate over the mandate.
The court ruled 7-2 in favor of the Trump administration and a Catholic charity that cares for the elderly in two related disputes against Pennsylvania, which sued over the validity of..."
"Trying to regain a clear lead among female voters, President Obama and Democrats said Wednesday that Mitt Romneys second debate performance showed the Republican presidential nominee will not stand up for womens rights and mocked him for saying he brought “binders full of women as job candidates with him when he became Massachusetts governor."
"Several Fox News hosts attempted to prod President Trump to intervene when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to text messages revealed by the House committee investigating the attack.
Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican and vice chair of the committee, read to the panel several of the exchanges between the hosts and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
“Multiple Fox News host knew the president needed to act immediately,” Ms. Cheney said at the hearing Monday evening when the panel unanimously voted to hold Mr. Meadows in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate with..."
"Nine months after belittling the Islamic State as a “JV” terrorist group, President Obama will devote an urgent prime-time address Wednesday to his plan for defeating the suddenly resurgent militants, a strategy that will rely heavily on U.S. partnership with an untested Iraqi government and unproven Syrian rebels."
"The Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee publicly released a list of alleged sexual abusers, urging churches to use the list ""proactively"" to protect the vulnerable, in the wake of an exhaustive report into sexual abuse and decades of cover-ups in the denomination.
The list, which the committee submitted to Guidepost Solutions as it compiled its 288-page investigative report, runs to 205 pages of names, with some names and claims redacted."
"Hurricane Laura, one of the most powerful storms to ever hit the continental United States, made landfall early Thursday morning near Lake Charles, Louisiana, bringing winds of over 150 mph and up to 9 feet of storm surge, according to the Weather Channel.

Self-described storm chaser Reed Timmer posted a video..."
"States will receive 6.5 million rapid coronavirus tests this week, President Trump said Monday, dubbing the move a “game changer” that will allow governors to protect first responders and reopen schools as his administration dispatches 150 million tests it bought from Abbott Laboratories a month ago.
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, thanked Mr. Trump for the BinaxNOW tests. He said the 15-minute turnaround time will allow him to screen K-12 schoolteachers daily instead of weekly.
“We want to get 100% of our kids back in the classroom,” Mr. Reeves..."
"The coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in its scope and duration, as has our response to it. The economy stands still while millions of people file for unemployment, our healthcare system is working overtime to prevent an exhaustion of resources, and our lawmakers are struggling to find ways to provide immediate relief while minimizing long-term damage.
All of this has required a kind of political and economic flexibility that has the potential to change the way we think about and address future crises. And it has, in some ways, accelerated..."
"Hours before western Michigan voters head to the polls for the primary, first-term Republican Rep. Peter Meijer blamed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for funding a $435,000 ad that has given airtime to his competitor, Donald Trump-endorsed John Gibbs.
Democrats had praised Meijer, who represents Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District, when he was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach President Trump over the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6, 2021.
“To leading Democrats, we were the Good Republicans,” Meijer wrote on Aug. 1 in a column titled “Why the Democrats..."
"Pope Francis’ recent comments favoring evolution and the Big Bang Theory led to rampant media coverage claiming that the pontiff is embracing a newfound and “progressive” mentality.
But many critics are charging that journalists generally missed the mark, noting that there was nothing new about his statements and citing the Catholic Church’s decades-old belief that evolution and God’s role in sparking creation are not incompatible concepts."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday announced the creation of a select House committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot following the failure last month of a bipartisan effort to form an independent commission in the Senate.
Pelosi said she hoped the 9/11-style commission would become a reality, but after Senate Republicans blocked its creation, she could not wait any longer to launch a deeper dive into the events surrounding the takeover of the Capitol. She created a House committee to investigate the origins of the attack and make recommendations on how to prevent..."
"Vice President Kamala Harris feels increasingly isolated inside the White House as her approval ratings plummet — with the first female veep believing she’s not getting the same support given to other members of the Biden administration, according to a detailed new report.
Despite their public show of unity, Biden and his right-hand woman have a dysfunctional relationship that has reached an “exhausted stalemate,” according to CNN, who based its report on interviews with nearly three dozen insiders.
Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly feels she’s not getting the same support President Biden gives to white male politicians.
At a time when the president would usually be expected to..."
"“One of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates. If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on FOX News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it.”

"Do voters prefer a serious legislator who does his job and reflects the values of his district to a headline-grabbing neophyte? We’re about to find out.
State senator Chuck Edwards isn’t well-known outside of North Carolina, but that won’t be the case for long if his bid to knock off Representative Madison Cawthorn in an upcoming Republican primary election succeeds.
Voters in North Carolina's heavily Republican 11th congressional district are unlikely to choose a Democrat in November."
"American families are on high alert after a gunman opened fire on Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers.
School districts across the country are increasing security in the wake of the tragedy, which raises questions about how parents and caregivers should speak to their children about violence, and the shooting itself, in an age-appropriate fashion.
""The first thing you need to do is not talk to your kid immediately. You need to take care of yourself first,"" Dr. Jill Emanuele, vice president of clinical training at Child Mind Institute in New York..."
"Pope Francis issued an apology to the indigenous people of Canada on Monday, asking forgiveness for the “evil committed by so many Christians” following international uproar over the treatment of indigenous children at residential Christian schools.
“I am deeply sorry — sorry for the ways in which, regrettably, many Christians supported the colonizing mentality of the powers that oppressed the Indigenous peoples,” Francis said, according to the Washington Post. 
Residential schools, which assimilated and Christianized indigenous children, were ran partly by the Catholic Church in the 19th and 20th centuries.
“It is painful to..."
"Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Thursday, vowing additional support from the United States as the war-torn country seeks to recapture territory overtaken by Russian forces.

"""The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War has been over for 20 years."" -Barack Obama, October 22, 2012.
It's been 12 days since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot out of the sky by Russian separatists with a surface to air missile, yet President Vladimir Putin seems untouched by global outrage over the incident. Now, the United States is accusing the Russians of violating a key nuclear test ban put forth by President Ronald Reagan and the former Soviet Union's Mikhail..."

"Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee devoted their opening statements on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to repeating a shameless lie. Why can’t they share their real reasons for opposing her?
The Democrats, one after another, claimed that confirming Barrett would result in ObamaCare being overturned when the court takes it up Nov. 10, with Americans dying as a result.
It’s plainly false: Several conservative justices clearly don’t buy the arguments made for striking down the law in this case. And Barrett, based on her overall..."
"President Biden on Friday claimed that al-Qaeda is “gone” from Afghanistan and that the Taliban is letting Americans reach Kabul’s airport, before Pentagon leaders contradicted the commander in chief on both claims.
Biden stumbled repeatedly when taking his first questions from reporters on Afghanistan’s fall to the Taliban — also claiming that US allies were not displeased by the chaotic US pullout, despite rare public rebukes.
“What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al Qaeda gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of..."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden decisively won the South Carolina Democratic primary on Saturday, claiming his first victory of the 2020 race and giving a crucial boost to his struggling campaign ahead of Super Tuesday.
The victory tracked with polls indicating that Biden, buoyed by support among black voters, had a significant lead in the state for months over Sen. Bernie Sanders and others, despite the surging Vermont senator beginning to close the gap after early primary wins that rocketed him to front-runner status. Fox News projects Sanders will finish..."
"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) tweeted “you absolutely love to see it,” as the U.S. oil market reached negative territory for the first time ever, potentially putting hundreds of American oil companies out of business.
“This along with record low interest rates means it’s the right time for a worker-led, mass investment in green infrastructure to save our planet. *cough*,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
She then deleted the tweet and rephrased it, saying “it‘s the right time to create millions of jobs transitioning to renewable and clean energy. A key opportunity.

"Chicago jurors on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly on multiple counts.
The ""I Believe I Can Fly"" singer, who is currently serving a 30-year sentence in New York after he was convicted in 2021 of sexually abusing young fans, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.

"President Trump, in an expletive-laden, over two-hour speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Saturday, accused FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team of trying to take him out with “bulls---” and accused a top Clinton aide of not having recovered “from getting his a-- kicked.”
Trump accused his opponents of moving away from a narrative of Russian collusion as Mueller prepares to file his report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He said that the report was being produced “by people who weren’t elected.”"
"Social media networks are scrambling to get rid of a viral conspiracy video spreading false claims about the coronavirus, according to a report.

"Donald Trump is running a relatively lean campaign machine and, despite pledges to self-fund, so far has been able to rely more on outside donations than his own deep pockets.
Campaign finance filings this week offered a glimpse into how the billionaire businessman is running his breaking-the-mold campaign.
The third quarter report showed that Trump raised $3.9 million over the period between June 30 through Sept. 30. Of that, $2.8 million came from individual donations of $200 or less. In addition, he's put up about $1.9 million of..."
"Anyone who thinks America is badly governed right now can comfort themselves that at least we aren’t Britain. Because for all the insanity of Washington, nothing can beat the utter breakdown of politics in Westminster.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned yesterday after a terrible two-and-a-half years in office. He came to power in 2019 by winning a general election with an impressive 80-seat majority for one main reason. In 2016 the British public had voted to leave the European Union. After that the Brexit side then fell out with..."

"Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and Democrat Stacey Abrams clashed during a Monday evening gubernatorial debate over the 2018 election and unproven claims of voter suppression.
“In 2018, I began my speech on Nov. 16, acknowledging that Governor Kemp had won the election,” Abrams said. “I then proceeded to lay out in great detail the challenges faced by voters under his leadership as secretary of state.”
Abrams refused to concede to Kemp in 2018, claiming “concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true, or proper” and that she could not..."
"Merck on Friday said it will seek emergency approval of an antiviral pill to treat COVID-19 after it significantly cut the risk of bad outcomes in clinical trials.
The New Jersey-based drugmaker said the drug, molnupiravir, cut the risk of hospitalization or death in half in high-risk patients with mild to moderate illness.
If authorized for use, it would be a groundbreaking treatment. Pills are easy to take and can reach a wider audience than monoclonal antibodies, an effective treatment in high demand.
Merck said it stopped the trial early in consultation..."
"Anthropologists in the future will spend a lot of time discussing and debating the question of when, exactly, the once-great American civilization went insane, why it happened, and how. I can only imagine what conclusions they will draw. As an American citizen in the present day, actually bearing witness to the collapse of sanity and reason in real time, I’m not sure that I can even answer those questions. Perhaps hindsight will lend some clarity to the issue.
What I do know is that this case will be viewed as..."
"A jury in Texas returned a verdict on Monday that will prevent a Texas dad from intervening in the gender transition of his 7-year-old son.
Jeffrey Younger had petitioned a court in Texas to grant him sole custody of his twin sons, James and Jude, in part to avoid a plan to infuse James with female hormones. James, who would like to be called Luna, has been the center of controversy in the heated debate among his parents and others.
Anne Georgulas, the mother of the two boys, has advocated..."

"The New York City Police Benevolent Association personally endorsed President Trump on Friday night for the next election as the commander in chief leans into his “law and order” platform.
The Post exclusively reported earlier Friday that the PBA planned to back him amid the city’s increase in crime and clashes with protesters.

"The Supreme Court overturned the half-century-old ruling in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortions nationwide, giving states the power to determine limits on when a woman can terminate a pregnancy.
A majority of justices, each appointed by Republican presidents, joined the opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ruling Mississippi can maintain its law banning abortion after 15 weeks of gestation. In addition to Alito, those voting in favor were Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas , Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.
A ruling in the case follows the unprecedented..."

"Tesla CEO Elon Musk aired his frustration with the media on Wednesday, issuing a series of tweets calling out the “hypocrisy of big media companies” before floating the idea of starting a website which would allow the public to rate journalists. “The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them,” Musk started out by tweeting.
Musk went on to claim that “journos are under constant pressure to get max..."
"The heartbreaking statistic relayed in my headline is not, as some have suggested, an attempt to diminish the tragedy of the tens of thousands of Americans who have died as a result of lethal Coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Every human life has value and dignity, and losing so many aging Americans to this virulent disease is gut-wrenching. The point is not that older lives lost do not matter. The point is that as we make difficult public policy decisions about public health and reopening the..."
"Capitol riot investigators subpoenaed a former Trump Justice Department official involved in questioning the results of the 2020 election.
The House Jan. 6 Select Committee announced on Wednesday that it seeks testimony and records from Jeffrey Clark, who was the head of the DOJ's civil division during the Trump administration, making him the latest of several Trump allies and advisers subpoenaed by the panel.
Clark was found to have drawn up a proposal to intervene in the Georgia certification process and raised doubts about the election results in other states, and former President Donald Trump is..."
"Two American fighters who went missing while defending Ukraine are apparently alive and in Russian custody, Russian state media reported.
Former US servicemen Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, spoke with the Russian state agency RT Friday from a detention center in a Moscow-controlled section of the Donbas region, the outlet said.

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s top aide privately apologized to Democratic lawmakers for withholding the state’s nursing home death toll from COVID-19 — telling them “we froze” out of fear that the true numbers would “be used against us” by federal prosecutors, The Post has learned.
The stunning admission of a coverup was made by secretary to the governor Melissa DeRosa during a video conference call with state Democratic leaders in which she said the Cuomo administration had rebuffed a legislative request for the tally in August because “right around the same..."
"President Donald Trump’s special adviser on the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Scott Atlas, formally resigned from his post on Monday, according to FOX News.
“I am writing to resign from my position as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,” Atlas said in a resignation letter obtained by FOX News. “I worked hard with a singular focus—to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,” Atlas wrote, adding that he “always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.”"
"President Biden ranted against ownership of what he called “high-caliber weapons” Monday — appearing to suggest that there should be restrictions on the most popular handgun in America, the 9mm pistol, and repeating a previously debunked claim that the Second Amendment prohibits ownership of cannons.
Speaking to reporters outside the White House after returning to Washington from a weekend that included a visit to the site of last week’s mass shooting in Texas, Biden recounted a visit to a trauma hospital in New York, where he said doctors had showed him X-rays..."
"House Democrats will deliver their impeachment case “like a violent crime prosecution"" against former President Donald Trump when the trial convenes in the Senate Tuesday afternoon.
Trump’s second impeachment trial starts at 1 p.m. and is expected to last a week or more. He is charged with one article of impeachment for citing an insurrection ahead of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent throng of his supporters.
Senior House Democratic aides on the impeachment managers' team said Tuesday the prosecution led by House impeachment managers..."
"In the latest in a series of specious and outlandish justifications for its illegal, immoral, and brutal invasion of sovereign Ukraine, Russia is claiming that Washington and Kyiv are working together to develop chemical and biological weapons.
Pure Putin propaganda.
Indeed, according to the U.S. State Department this week:
The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.
On the..."
"House impeachment managers led by the House Clerk and the Acting House Sergeant at Arms walked the article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate floor on Monday night.
The group of impeachment managers brought the article from the House side to the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol, presenting them to the Senate so they can begin their trial. Democratic Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, who will preside over Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate instead of Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, accepted the article from the..."
"As Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump held one of his typically raucous rallies inside the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa, Calif., Thursday night, a wild scene was unfolding outside.
A large group of protesters flooded the streets as Trump kicked off his Golden State campaign. The crowd continued to increase as the billionaire businessman’s speech drew to a close around 8:45 p.m. local time and he began signing autographs as his Secret Service detail stood close by."
"At this point in the border crisis, one would think the administration would be doing all it can to actually stem the flow of illegal immigrants from Central America. In reality, however, it seems some of their proposed solutions would do just the opposite.

"Senate Democrats know they’re going to be defeated on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. The GOP has the votes. They don’t. They can’t block him, partially the reason why the opposition to this nomination, while intense at times, has been lackluster overall. They have little tools to fight with against the Trump White House on judges, which has been pushing through nominees at all levels."
"The avowed Antifa supporter who was a suspect in the killing of a Patriot Prayer member during a clash of opposing groups in Portland, Ore., last Saturday appeared to be targeting the victim prior to the shooting, according to court documents unsealed Friday.
Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, allegedly hid in a parking garage, waiting for Aaron “Jay” Danielson, 39, and another Patriot Prayer member, the documents say, according to OregonLive.com.

"President Donald Trump lashed out at Twitter after the popular social media platform began to fact-check his tweets for the first time ever on Tuesday.
The president warned that he would not allow Twitter to interfere with the election, which he equated with the fact-checking.
""@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election,"" the president tweeted.
""They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,"" he added.

"The House will vote on two immigration bills this week as the numbers of migrant families and children detained at the southern border surges.
The first bill, dubbed the Dream and Promise Act (DPA) would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, immigrants who have lived in the U.S. illegally since being brought as young children.
The second, the Farm Modernization Workforce Act (FMWA), would create a certified agricultural worker status and streamline the H-2A visa application process. President Joe Biden has also announced a sweeping immigration reform plan in..."
"Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said Wednesday he believes former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush can win the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, dismissing the notion that conservatives wouldn’t elect an “establishment” candidate by pointing to the party’s standard bearer the past two presidential cycles. “See John McCain; see Mitt Romney,” Mr. Pawlenty, who ended his 2012 pre"
"Great-power competition is back — just when America happens to be an overstretched, and now-humiliated, empire. Events in the wake of President Joe Biden’s botched exit from Afghanistan punctuate the point.
China wasted little time seizing on the debacle to make geopolitical inroads and assert a growing hegemony in the Asia-Pacific. The Beijing regime moved to develop relations with the new Taliban regime in Kabul and held assault exercises near Taiwan island on Tuesday.
Biden’s slapdash withdrawal came on the heels of months of failed intelligence assessments and years of naïve assurances from US military..."
"House Republicans resurrected their border bill Friday morning and said they were on track to pass the rewritten measure later in the day — though with the Senate gone for the summer the vote will be more a political statement than a policy-making exercise.
GOP leaders weren’t making any predictions after suffering an embarrassing conservative rebellion on Thursday, which forced them back to the drawing board, but rank-and-file lawmakers said they believed they had finally corralled enough votes to pass it."
"U.S. equity markets tumbled Monday after an oil price war broke out between Saudi Arabia and Russia and amid new cases of coronavirus, especially in America.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 2,000 points lower, coming back from a point drop of more than 2,150 points, or 8.2 percent, at session lows while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were lower by 7.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively.

"Senator Ted Cruz of Texas won the Iowa Republican caucuses in an upset over billionaire Donald Trump, while Democrat Hillary Clinton was clinging to the narrowest edge over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida exceeded expectations with a strong third place finish that will give him a chance to make a case that establishment Republicans who’ve recoiled at the prospect of Trump or Cruz as the party nominee should coalesce around him.
With 90 percent of precincts counted in the Republican contest, Cruz led Trump..."
"Leaders of the G-7 countries are set to pledge the distribution of 1 billion vaccines to 100 developing nations during this week’s summit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday.
On the eve of the summit, President Biden announced that the U.S. will purchase 500 million doses from Pfizer and will supply half of all the vaccines set to be shared globally.

"The Associated Press published a story this week about a small protest outside Netflix’s headquarters that was held in response to the company’s defense of comedian Dave Chappelle and his recent special. In the story, the Associated Press included a picture of a Chappelle supporter who “clashed” with protesters. The photo caption read: “Comedian and videographer Vito Gesualdi screams profanities as he engages with peaceful protesters begging him to leave outside the Netflix building in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles.”
But according to Gesualdi, this never happened. He didn’t yell at protesters or..."
"Presumed President-elect Joseph R. Biden said Monday he wants Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the Homeland Security Department, tapping an Obama-era mainstay who helped create the DACA program that protected “Dreamers,” but was also part of the team that expanded family detention.
Mr. Mayorkas, born in Cuba, would be the first Hispanic person and first immigrant to head the department, created in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
He brings extensive experience at DHS, having served as chief at the legal-immigration agency and then deputy secretary for the entire..."
"President Obama is urging another short-term fix to avoid automatic spending cuts set to hit March 1, calling on Congress to come up with an alternative package containing tens of billions of dollars in spending cuts and tax revenue.

"Unlike Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, the Soviet Union and the British Empire, the United States finds itself in a unique position that no other nation has found themselves in before when it comes to having a presence in Afghanistan: America is welcome.
Through the stabilizing efforts of the United States military, the NATO mission, and the Afghan government, we have achieved so much. Over 9 million Afghan children are in school today, one-third of whom are young girls who were previously banned from accessing education by the Taliban...."
"I recently had a pleasant encounter with a great and outspoken American who, despite his libertarian leanings, supports Hillary Clinton for president. I congratulated him on making a tough call but allowed as how I was looking forward to casting my ballot for the Libertarian Party's flag bearers, Gary Johnson and William Weld. ""It will be unadulterated pleasure,"" I offered, ""as there is no opportunity cost."""
"The Senate voted to override President Trump’s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, providing the president his first and likely only veto defeat.
The likely final vote of the current Congress provided more than the two-thirds needed to force the NDAA into law over Trump’s objection.
The critical defense and policy bill sets 2021 spending levels at $740 billion and provides important directives to the Defense Department for the coming years. It also includes a significant infusion of funding for cybersecurity, which lawmakers touted in the wake of a..."
"Seven months ago, on the ides of March, Donald Trump won every primary contest except Ohio, knocked Marco Rubio out of the race, and left the Republican Party’s leaders facing a stark choice. They could mobilize fully against him, do everything possible to deny him the nomination, sustain and support his challengers all the way to the convention, knowing that Trump would try to bring the pillars of the party down upon their heads."
"Most Federal Reserve officials agreed last month that surging inflation and an incredibly tight labor market could warrant a faster-than-expected pace of interest rate hikes this year as policymakers look to combat soaring prices.
Minutes from the U.S. central bank's Jan. 25-26 meeting show that many policymakers believe the current economic conditions could necessitate a quicker normalization of policy than in 2015, though they stressed that this outlook ultimately hinged on financial developments. The Fed kept rates ultra-low for years following the 2008 financial crisis, only raising them once at the end of 2015...."
"The Chernobyl plant in Ukraine is disconnected from the grid due to damage inflicted by Russian occupying forces, sparking concerns of radioactive contamination if the cooling of spent nuclear fuel stops.
The 750 kV Chernobyl-Kyiv high-voltage line is currently disconnected ""due to damage by the occupiers,"" Energoatom, or the state-run National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine, said Wednesday.

"The head of the US Food and Drug Administration has clarified his remarks about a new COVID-19 treatment — and insisted politics had nothing to do with his agency’s decision to authorize its emergency use.
“I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tweeted.
“What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.”
Hahn also said the decision to authorize emergency use..."
"Thomas Barrack, who spearheaded the inaugural fund for former President Donald Trump in 2017, was arrested and charged Tuesday with illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.

"It is one of the irritating defects of genius that, particularly when surrounded by crushing mediocrity, the audacity of having ideas becomes a source of recurring controversy. To have the most ideas means you have the most good ideas, but also the most bad ideas.

"Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.
Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won't hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.
""Antifa knows this,"" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""Local and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the..."

The U.S. reached 300,000 reported deaths on Dec. 17, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The one month it took to reach 400,000 is the fastest that coronavirus deaths have reached a 100,000 mark.

"In a White House address Tuesday, President Biden pledged to to “respond forcefully” if Russia targets Americans in any potential attack on Ukraine. He also promised to defend America’s NATO allies with the “full force of American power” amid the heightened tensions in Eastern Europe, though he also specified he would not send U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, which is not part of the alliance.
“Make no mistake, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” Biden said. “An attack against..."

The Treasury Department said in a notification that it does not plan to renew the license that allowed Russia to keep paying its debtholders through American banks, making a Russian default all but inevitable.
Since the first rounds of sanctions, the Treasury Department has given banks a license to process any dollar-denominated bond payments from Russia. That..."
"President Donald Trump met with Queen Elizabeth II Monday during a three-day visit to Britain meant to strengthen ties between the two nations, although the trip was immediately at risk of being overshadowed by Brexit turmoil and Trump's feud with London's mayor.

"The left’s construct of identity politics is a scourge, not just because it’s insulting and shortsighted, but also because the impact of conditioning people into identifying through one sliver of who they are strips away the power of the individual. Ultimately, it destroys lives. By design, that allows politicians to more easily control and manipulate the targets populating their own base: women, people of color and gays.
There are examples of this throughout the last century highlighting how racial and sexual minorities are shamed, denigrated and even their very identities..."
"The Trump Administration is halting applications to the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as it examines the policy’s viability going forward, the Department of Homeland Security announced in a memo on Tuesday. DHS also said it would no longer accept applications for Employment Authorization Documents and is renewing existing DACA protections for only one year, rather than two.
The news comes just weeks after the Supreme Court rejected the administration’s effort to end the Obama-era policy, which has provided legal protections and work permits to some 800,000 unauthorized..."

"President Joe Biden’s press conference last week was atrocious, but one of his worst missteps amounted to telling the truth about Germany, if not by name.
Biden said there’d be divisions within NATO over a “minor incursion” by Russia into Ukraine. This is true enough, and the chief cause would be a Germany that is staking a strong claim to being our worst European ally.
If NATO is hollowed out over time, Germany will have much to do with it. The country is too guilt-wracked over its enormities in World War II to..."

"WASHINGTON — Coronavirus aid negotiations continue to stall between lawmakers in Washington as millions of Americans face a financial breaking point amid the pandemic — with Nancy Pelosi vowing “we’re not budging.”
A call between the powerful House Speaker and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — their first communication in weeks — proved fruitless on Thursday with both sides far apart on how much should be spent.

Many state unemployment offices were closed last week for the New Year's holiday. As a result, the department relied on estimates for nine states. Two weeks ago, the department estimated 19 states because of Christmas closings.

"Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's team of lawyers will no longer be working with Trump's defense team during special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling. They had been sharing information up until this point. That may mean, The New York Times muses, that Flynn's team is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. The only reason for the split would be a conflict of interest."
"The select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot is entering its third day of testimony, with the questioning largely set to center on former President Donald Trump's efforts to convince former Vice President Mike Pence to back his bid to overturn the election results.

"How bad do some House Republicans think the Senate bill is? Ohio Rep. Steven LaTourette thinks the only way that number of Senate Republicans could have voted for the plan was if they were drunk:
""I think our sense, at least in the House, was that a number of the Republicans that voted for it must have been drunk, because it really was a number that wasn't reflective of where we thought some of these people were going to be on a bill like this,"" he said after emerging from..."
"President Trump’s plan for Black America designates the KKK and Antifa as terrorist organizations and calls for making lynching a national hate crime, while pledging to increase access to capital in Black communities by nearly $500 billion, Fox News has learned.
The president on Friday is expected to roll out details of what the campaign is calling the “Platinum Plan,” which details “opportunity,” “security,” “prosperity,” and “fairness” for the Black Community."
"President Trump Saturday signed four executive actions to provide Americans financial relief from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Here's a look at what they would do:
$400 weekly federal unemployment aid
Trump's executive action calls for $400-per-week in supplemental unemployment aid. Unemployed people were getting $600-a-week extra until the federal program expired at the end of July.
Trump's action would require states to pay for 25 percent of the $400 weekly benefit, while the federal government would pick up 75 percent.
Trump would divert up to $44 billion from FEMA's Disaster..."
"Washington negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff have made many investors nervous.
Congress and the White House must reach a deal before Jan. 1 to cut the deficit -- a deal that could include higher taxes on capital gains, dividends, and other investments.
Taxes on capital gains, including profits from stocks, could go from 15 to 25 percent, and taxes on dividends could go from 15 to 43 percent.

"There’s plenty of blame to go around, but one thing is clear:
The ObamaCare battle was Mission Impossible from the beginning, because Donald Trump ran against Republican orthodoxy on health insurance.
There was simply no way to satisfy the GOP’s most conservative wing, which wanted to junk most of ObamaCare, the center-right conservatives who don’t want millions to lose coverage or face huge rate hikes, and Trump’s own conditions."
"President Trump was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and returned to the White House on Monday evening to continue his fight against the novel coronavirus, after his medical team warned that he “may not entirely be out of the woods yet.”
Dressed in a navy suit and tie and wearing a face mask, Trump walked out of Walter Reed on his own. Upon walking out the doors of the hospital, he made a low fist pump and gave a thumbs up to the press as he got..."
"President Trump is no longer contagious, according to his doctor.
“This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting the CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” his physician, Sean Conley, wrote in a memo released by the White House Saturday night.
The memo comes 10 days after Trump first experienced symptoms of his COVID-19 diagnosis and as the president readies to return to..."
"A story this old and unprovable can’t be allowed to delay a Supreme Court confirmation vote. The woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of a drunken assault when both were teenagers has now come forward publicly, and on Monday it caused Republicans to delay a confirmation vote and schedule another public hearing. Yet there is no way to confirm her story after 36 years, and to let it stop Mr. Kavanaugh’s confirmation would ratify what has all the earmarks of a calculated political ambush.
This is not to say Christine Blasey Ford..."
"The Biden administration's plan to forgive a significant portion of federal student loans will cost roughly $400 billion, according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
In a letter to Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), the senior Republicans on the Senate and House education committees, Phillip Swagel, the director of the CBO, estimated that the student loan plan announced by the Biden administration last month will cost about $400 billion but that the estimate was ""highly uncertain."""
"President Trump on Thursday vowed a “safe and effective vaccine” by the end of the year to combat the novel coronavirus, while slamming Joe Biden's plan to address the pandemic as a ""surrender to the virus."" During his formal nomination acceptance speech from the South Lawn at the White House on the final night of the Republican National Convention, the president touted his administration’s efforts in response to the global pandemic.

“We will have a safe and effective..."
"Donald Trump will never testify before Congress’s Jan. 6 committee, subpoena or no subpoena. He will resist it and will challenge any such subpoena in the courts — for a couple of months.
Since the overwhelming likelihood is that Republicans will win control of the House in November, in one way or another, the subpoena will probably be quashed come January 2023.
So the highly theatrical decision of the committee to vote (with a full roll call, like in “1776” when they sign the Declaration of Independence) to compel the former..."
"Attorney General Merrick Garland on Oct. 4 announced a concentrated effort to target any threats of violence, intimidation, and harassment by parents toward school personnel.
The announcement comes days after a national association of school boards asked the Biden administration to take “extraordinary measures” to prevent alleged threats against school staff that the association said was coming from parents who oppose mask mandates and the teaching of critical race theory.
Garland directed the FBI and U.S. attorneys in the next 30 days to convene meetings with federal, state, and local leaders within 30 days to “facilitate..."
"U.S. commandos got to within 100 yards of the walled compound where al-Qaida-linked militants were holding American hostage Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie when a noise — possibly a dog barking — may have alerted people inside of the raid, U.S. officials briefed on the failed operation said Saturday.
Then the shooting started, The Wall Street Journal says in an analysis of the operation.
After about a 30 minute battle with the AQAP terrorists, the Special Operations team of about 40 fighters came out, still under fire and..."
"U.S. job growth slowed sharply in May and wages rose less than expected, suggesting the loss of momentum in economic activity was spreading to the labor market, which could increase calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.
The cool-off in hiring reported by the Labor Department on Friday was even before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and two of its major trading partners, China and Mexico.
Economists have warned that the trade fights could undermine the economy, which will celebrate 10..."
"Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning where he launched his latest attacks on Hillary Clinton, calling her ""brainwashed"" after she acknowledged that she ""short-circuited"" when making a misstatement.
When speaking to members of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in Washington Friday, Clinton sought to ""clarify and explain"" a statement she made that FBI Director James Comey said that her previous answers about her private email use were ""truthful."""
"Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on President Trump to ""abandon the wall"" Saturday if he wants to reopen the government, saying Trump does not have the votes in the Senate to get it funded -- hours after the government shut down over an impasse over funding for Trump's signature 2016 campaign promise. ""It will never pass the Senate, not today, not next week, not next year. So President Trump, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple,"" Schumer said on the..."
"Vice President Mike Pence is meeting Tuesday with leaders in Dublin after staying overnight at a Trump property on the other side of Ireland, prompting Democrats to accuse him of “funneling” taxpayer money to his boss.
Mr. Pence flew from an airport near Mr. Trump’s golf club in Doonbeg, on the west coast, to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and other dignitaries 180 miles away in the east-coast capital.
The vice president and second lady are scheduled to fly back to Doonbeg later Tuesday, raising eyebrows from Democrats who are..."
"An ""embarrassed and humiliated"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday apologized for the bridge-gate scandal and said he has fired a top aide after fresh revelations that his staff played a key role in closing some lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge in what critics say was a political vendetta.
""I come out here to apologize to the people of New Jersey,"" he said, opening what would be a two-hour press conference. ""I apologize to the people of Fort Lee. And I apologize to the State Legislature.

"The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft on Monday deliberately slammed into an asteroid millions of miles away in an innovative test for a possible killer rock that could one day be headed to Earth. 
NASA described the mission as an ""impact success,"" saying the ""vending machine-sized spacecraft"" collided with the asteroid Dimorphos, which is the size of a football stadium and poses no threat to Earth. 
The impact occurred 7 million miles away, with the DART spacecraft plowing into the rock at 14,000 mph. Scientists expected the impact..."
"The brother of George Floyd testified Wednesday at a House hearing on racial profiling and police brutality, tearfully urging lawmakers to ""stop the pain"" as he recalled in vivid detail how his older sibling died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

"The U.S. Supreme Court sided with President Joe Biden on Thursday as he seeks to end a hardline immigration policy begun under his predecessor Donald Trump that forced tens of thousands of migrants to stay in Mexico to await U.S. hearings on their asylum claims.
The justices, in a 5-4 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, overturned a federal appeals court decision requiring Biden to restart Trump's ""remain in Mexico"" policy after the Republican-led states of Texas and Missouri sued to maintain the program. The ruling is a victory for Biden, who..."
"A judge ordered the release from prison of President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying he believes the government retaliated against him for writing a book about Trump.
Michael Cohen's First Amendment rights were violated when he was ordered back to prison on July 9 after probation authorities said he refused to sign a form banning him from publishing the book or communicating publicly in other manners, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said.
Hellerstein ordered Michael Cohen released from prison by 2 p.m. on Friday."
"Emergency legislation meant to address the border crisis abruptly was abandoned Thursday afternoon in the House, after Republican leaders were unable to round up enough support to pass it.
Fox News is told lawmakers plan to leave for the August recess without voting on the measure. Sources said GOP leaders were ""way short"" of the votes they needed, with conservative lawmakers joining Democrats in refusing to back the package."
"Republican Rep. Darrell Issa declared Thursday that the embattled IRS official who refused to testify Wednesday had no right to do so, and is now looking to haul her back before his committee.
The chairman of the House oversight committee made the call after consulting with attorneys about IRS official Lois Lerner's bizarre appearance before the panel on Wednesday. Lerner, the head of the exempt organizations division which oversaw the controversial targeting of conservative groups, caused confusion Wednesday morning when she pleaded the Fifth and refused to answer questions..."
"The number of new U.S. COVID-19 cases continued to break records for the third day straight on Friday, when more than 97,000 infections were reported, according to NBC News.

"The Biden administration will tap into public health emergency powers to speed up the distribution of vaccines for monkeypox and improve testing capacity.
The decision to declare monkeypox a public health emergency allows the administration expanded powers to deal with the disease, such as the ability to contract with private companies, such as vaccine distributors, in order to speed up the deployment of the nation's supply of shots. It also gives federal health authorities greater access to state data to monitor the outbreak.
“We’re prepared to take our response to the next level..."
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned of “permanent economic damage” unless the United States begins reopening businesses during the coronavirus pandemic — but cautioned that it must be done in a “thoughtful way.”
“I think there’s a considerable risk of not reopening, you’re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the American public,” Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.”
“We’re going to reopen in a very thoughtful way that gets people back to work safely, that has them social distance,” he continued.
The question of reopening the economy comes..."
"Supporters of Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed the government palace in protest on Monday, as the religious leader said he is resigning from politics.
The religious leader's political party won more seats in parliament than any other in October's elections, but not enough to have a majority. This resulted in a deadlock, as al-Sadr has refused to work with Iranian rivals. 
This is not the first time al-Sadr has said he was leaving politics, leaving some skeptical of his announcement. He has made similar declarations in the past when political developments were..."
"The Israeli cabinet approved a 24-hour extension of its cease-fire Saturday but said it would respond to any future rocket fire from Gaza after Hamas rejected an earlier proposed four-hour extension and fired rockets into Israel.
The announcement came after Hamas confirmed that it fired five rockets at Israel late Saturday after rejecting an earlier offer from Israel to extend a 12-hour humanitarian cease-fire by four hours, casting new doubt on international efforts to broker an end to 19 days of fighting.
The terror group said two of the rockets..."

Obama aides said they reached out to Romney's..."
"President Joe Biden will nominate federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday to replace Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, which would make her the first black woman on the high court's bench should she be confirmed by the Senate.
Breyer announced his retirement last month after 28 years on the Supreme Court, effective when the current term ends this summer. That paved the opportunity for Biden to fulfill his 2020 campaign promise of nominating a black woman as a Supreme Court justice.
Jackson, 51, was known to be on a short list of contenders the White..."
"President Trump on Friday slammed James Comey as an “untruthful slime ball,” as the ex-FBI director's upcoming book and accompanying tour raised anew salacious allegations about Trump first made in an unverified dossier and blasted the president for everything from integrity to his height, skin and hair."
"Experts warn that despite the first antiviral pills for COVID-19 promising protection for those at risk of severe disease, Pfizer's or Merck's new medications may not be safe for everyone, NBC News reported over the weekend.
One of the two drugs in Pfizer's Paxlovid antiviral cocktail could cause severe or life-threatening interactions with commonly used medications, including statins, blood thinners and some antidepressants, and the FDA does not recommend Paxlovid for those with severe kidney or liver disease.
In addition, due to concerns about the potential side effects of Merck's molnupiravir, the FDA has..."
"Economists had forecast a decline to 680,000 from the previous week’s 719,000. This is the second consecutive week in which initial jobless claims moved up in contradiction to expectations. The upper end of the range of forecasts in the Econoday survey was 705,000.
Jobless claims can be volatile week to week so economists like to look at the four-week average. This rose by 2,500 to 723,750.
Continuing claims, which get reported with a week’s lag, fell to 3,734,000, a decrease of 16,000, in the week ended March 27.

U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays of the Western District of Louisiana granted a request for a preliminary injunction made by the attorneys general of over 20 states on Friday, according to Fox News. The attorneys general sued the federal government over its plans to end Title 42, claiming the Biden administration had violated federal rules in killing the health policy.
Title 42 is a health policy that..."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo slammed the New York City Council’s move strip the New York Police Department of $1 billion in funding, questioning “what it means” and calling for concrete action.
“I don’t know what it means,” Cuomo said during a press briefing Wednesday. “What does that mean? Does this mean I am less safe? Where did you take the billion dollars from? Does it mean I am more safe? Does it have any effect on police abuse? I don’t know what it means.”
Cuomo’s comments came after the..."
"In the middle of a deadly pandemic, some leftists are still laser-focused on dividing Americans along racial lines. The entire country has been affected by the novel coronavirus, but some leftists are pushing the narrative that the coronavirus is hurting minority groups to a larger extent than the white population. But while giving an update on Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the current data does not support that narrative.
In California, at least 16,957 people have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. The governor says California has examined..."
"Covid vaccines can make for strange bedfellows, and raise your hand if you thought the Biden White House would be accused of ignoring the science? We didn’t think so. But that’s been the charge as two Food and Drug Administration regulators have resigned amid what media leaks claim is too much political agitation for Covid vaccine booster shots.
Count us with the White House on this one. Mounting evidence shows that vaccine efficacy wanes over time as Covid antibodies do, especially for older folks, and that the vaccines are less..."
"The closed doors of the Trump impeachment investigation are swinging wide open.
When the gavel strikes at the start of the House hearing on Wednesday, America and the rest of the world will have the chance to see and hear for themselves for the first time about President Donald Trump's actions toward Ukraine and consider whether they are, in fact, impeachable offenses.
It's a remarkable moment, even for a White House full of them.
All on TV, committee leaders will set the stage, then comes the main feature: Two seasoned..."
"President Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey, according to the White House.
“Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.
He also said the president acted “on the clear recommendations” of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions."
"Come September, all schoolchildren ought to be back in the classroom. Yet, many politicians and school chiefs are afraid to promise: no more Zoom school.
It took Bill De Blasio to take the lead. ""New York City public schools, 1 million kids, will be back in their classroom in September, all in-person, no remote. That’s the news,"" announced New York's often-feckless mayor.
De Blasio’s decision to get rid of remote learning altogether is important since many school districts plan on keeping it as an alternative even after health officials declare..."
"Anxious parents and teachers began arriving on Tuesday morning for the first day of school in Uvalde, Texas — three months after the massacre at Robb Elementary School that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
No students or staff will return to the site of the deadliest school shooting in almost a decade, which has been shuttered permanently and will be razed to the ground, but tensions are still high in the community amid ongoing security concerns."
"President Biden will announce Wednesday the U.S. is purchasing an additional 500 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to give to the rest of the world, bringing its total commitment to more than 1 billion shots.

"A top FBI official who came under fire from Republicans over whistleblower complaints, including claims about the investigation into Hunter Biden, and his anti-Trump social media posts has retired from the bureau, his legal counsel confirmed on Tuesday.
Timothy Thibault, the FBI assistant special agent in charge of the Washington Field Office, ""was not fired, not forced to retire, and not asked to retire,"" lawyers representing him from Morrison & Foerster LLP said in a statement shared on Twitter by CBS News's Catherine Herridge.
Thibault's lawyers strongly rejected early reporting on Thibault's departure from the FBI..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said he will set up a vote on the slimmed-down COVID-19 relief bill for later this week.
“It does not contain every idea our party likes. I am confident Democrats will feel the same. Yet Republicans believe the many serious differences between our two parties should not stand in the way of agreeing where we can agree and making law that helps our nation,” Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said in a statement.
He also slammed Democrats, blaming them for stonewalling negotiations last month...."
"Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew on Sunday defended accusations of fear mongering over Congress potentially failing to increase the federal debt limit -- including his assertion that the economic impact would be “catastrophic.” He declined, however, to provide specific examples, saying instead that Congress blowing the Oct. 17 debt-limit deadline would be “reckless.”
“The consequences are immediate and very bad,” Lew said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The direction is bad. There is a range of how bad.”
Lew also said the White House is willing to negotiate on fiscal issues, despite..."
"The chaos in Afghanistan may have changed global headlines, but it has done little to shake Democrats from their course at home. House members return to Capitol Hill on Monday to begin advancing the party’s $3.5 trillion makeover of the American social safety net.
Debates about welcoming tens of thousands of Afghan migrants did nothing to derail Democrats’ hopes of approving an amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants already in the U.S. as part of that makeover. Questions about the U.S. retreat have not dimmed party leaders’ plans this fall to erase one of..."
"The FBI said late Sunday that it is investigating the taking of hostages at a Texas synagogue a day prior as a “terrorism-related matter.”
“This is a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted, and is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force,” the bureau said.
Malik Faisal Akram, 44, a British national, stormed inside the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, interrupting services and taking four hostages, authorities have said.
On a livestream, he was heard demanding the release of Pakistani-born Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence after..."
"The Biden administration’s push toward electric vehicles is hitting speed bumps as a new poll shows thousands of EV owners are struggling to charge their cars while away from home.
Consumer research firm J.D. Power released its second annual United States Electric Vehicle Experience Public Charging Study last week, showing that 20% of EV owners reported “operability and maintenance a key issue” at public charging stations.
""The study finds that one out of every five respondents ended up not charging their vehicle during their visit,"" J.D. Power reported. ""Of those who didn’t charge, 72% indicated that it..."
"It's been a whole 11 days since President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion spending bill, so naturally the White House is already planning the next, even bigger spending package.
The New York Times reported Monday that Biden's advisors are prepping a $3 trillion hike in federal spending. The money would go to infrastructure projects, climate change initiatives, community colleges, and a variety of other Democratic priorities. The plan may also include higher taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals, but it seems unlikely that the tax increases would offset such..."

“So, I’m fighting a battle. It’s a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me,” Trump said, according to ABC News. “Sometimes you don’t have time to be totally, as you would say presidential — you have to get things done.”
Trump went on to tout his record, noting he’s appointed more than 200 federal judges and two..."
"Newly minted vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan hit the stump this weekend with a level of energy that seemed to boost Mitt Romneys entire campaign, giving the presumptive nominee a much-needed change in the narrative while adding another high-profile fundraiser and campaigner to deploy across the country.
It got off to an inauspicious start, though.
When Mr. Ryan was first introduced Saturday in Norfolk, Va., walking down the gangplank of the USS Wisconsin with the theme of the movie “Air Force One playing in the background, Mr. Romney got a little..."
"President Obama unveiled a long-awaited plan to drastically expand the number of people eligible for overtime pay, in a move that he said would ensure ""hard work is rewarded"" -- but that critics warn could hurt job growth at a fragile time.
Under the proposal unveiled late Monday, salaried workers who earn nearly $1,000 per week would become eligible for overtime pay.
The rule from the Labor Department would more than double the threshold at which employers can avoid paying overtime, from the current $455 a week to..."
"With the Senate Judiciary Committee set to start hearings in a week for Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson , a prominent conservative judicial activist is signaling to Republicans how to ""contrast"" how advocates portray her versus the high court pick's ""actual record.""
Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino told the Washington Examiner that President Joe Biden is ""trying to replace a moderate liberal justice with a radical liberal justice,"" comparing Jackson to retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.

"The outgoing commissioner of the IRS apologized Friday for his agency's practice of targeting conservative groups, calling the actions ""foolish"" while claiming it was not motivated by partisanship.
""As acting commissioner, I want to apologize on the behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service provided,"" Steven Miller, the outgoing commissioner, said at the first congressional hearing on the scandal.

"The FBI has confirmed that Anthony Warner, 63, was the culprit behind a Christmas Day bombing in downtown Nashville.
""Based on the evidence that we got at this point, we’ve come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber,"" U.S. Attorney Don Cochran said, adding that Warner perished in the explosion.
The explosion left at least three people hospitalized and 41 businesses damaged — perhaps most significantly an AT&T facility adjacent to where the RV that exploded was positioned. The blast caused outages in parts of..."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in a reversal of a previous recommendation, cut the number of days of isolation for Americans who contract COVID-19 from 10 days to five days regardless of vaccination status.
The agency similarly shortened the time that close contacts of COVID-19 need to quarantine. Authorities with the CDC said that its latest guidance is in line with more and more evidence suggesting that those who contract the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus are the most infectious two days before and three days after symptoms emerge.
Meanwhile, the CDC said that..."
"GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was troubled to hear Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promise ""total coordination"" between himself and the White House regarding President Trump's impeachment trial.
McConnell, 77, of Kentucky, made the comment about his plan to work with the White House, which sparked fierce outrage among Democrats, during an appearance on Hannity earlier this month.
“And in fairness, when I heard that, I was disturbed,” Murkowski explained to KTUU News Tuesday. “To me, it means that we have to take that step back from being hand-in-glove..."
"Top Trump administration officials and Democratic congressional leaders will try on Wednesday to narrow their stark differences over a coronavirus aid bill, with no guarantees they can craft a compromise before some jobless benefits expire at the end of this week.

An hour-long meeting of the four broke up late on Tuesday afternoon amid no..."

Riot police have been on the scene since early this morning bracing for violence."
"Hunter Biden, the much-discussed son of Democratic frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden, is the father of a baby born in Arkansas in August of 2018, according to court filings. For months, Biden denied that he fathered the child; however, the mother has stated that Hunter “verbally admitted” to her in private that he was the father of the child.
The motion, filed earlier today in Independence County Circuit Court, declares with “scientific certainty” that Hunter, 49, is the father of a child born to 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts...."
"New York state lawmakers will begin an impeachment inquiry against Governor Andrew Cuomo amid a pair of burgeoning scandals.
State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, announced on Thursday that the body’s judiciary committee would take up the inquiry. The committee will have subpoena powers and the ability to interview witnesses while it considers potential articles of impeachment.
The inquiry will cover both scandals that have hobbled the Cuomo administration in recent months. These include the administration’s misrepresentation of the number of coronavirus victims in state nursing..."
"Pro-pot activists are convinced that marijuana ballot measures will help juice voter turnout this year and potentially push Democrats over the top in key states such as Arizona and Montana — a political calculus President Trump has fretted about.
Marijuana legalization measures are on the ballot in those two states, home to competitive presidential and/or Senate contests, plus Mississippi, New Jersey, and South Dakota."
"President Donald Trump's latest tariff hike on Chinese goods took effect Friday and Beijing said it would retaliate, escalating a battle over China's technology ambitions and other trade tensions.
The Trump administration raised duties on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%. China's Commerce Ministry said it would impose ""necessary countermeasures"" but gave no details.
The increase went ahead even after American and Chinese negotiators began more talks in Washington aimed at ending a dispute that has disrupted billions of dollars in trade and shaken global financial markets...."
"Even Greenpeace has finally acknowledged the truth: recycling plastic makes no sense.
This has been obvious for decades to anyone who crunched the numbers, but the fantasy of recycling plastic proved irresistible to generations of environmentalists and politicians. They preached it to children, mandated it for adults, and bludgeoned municipalities and virtue-signaling corporations into wasting vast sums—probably hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide—on an enterprise that has been harmful to the environment as well as to humanity.
Now Greenpeace has seen the light, or at least a glimmer of rationality...."
"It was a brief truce amid a nasty campaign fight between the two leading candidates in a congressional special election Democratic primary in northern Ohio that’s turned into proxy battle between the party’s establishment and progressive wings.

"As the country under President Joe Biden’s watch slowly dwindles under his useless policies, Democrats are looking for a loophole to redeem themselves with voters. Cue Roe v. Wade being overturned, a way for the left to threaten women’s so-called abortion “rights” in hopes to appeal to voters. 
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) promised that if Democrats keep control of the nation in 2024, all of America will become a “safe haven” for abortions. 
Murphy claimed that if Republicans win over the House, Senate and the White House, there will be..."
"The U.S. Coast Guard has rescued nearly two dozen people in Florida as of Thursday morning following the devastation from Hurricane Ian, with more rescues expected throughout the day.
Hurricane Ian made landfall Wednesday on the state’s Gulf Coast at nearly the strength of a Category 5 storm.

"President Trump said Tuesday that Democrats’ second attempt to impeach him over his role in last week’s violence at the Capitol is causing “tremendous anger” before defending the contents of the speech he delivered ahead of the riot, in which he urged his supporters to congregate at the Capitol in a show of “strength.”
“It’s really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics. It’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he was leaving for a visit to the southern..."
"President Obama appears to be straddling both sides of the rhetorical border as he tries to explain why he's pushing off executive action on immigration until after the November elections.
Obama, speaking June 30 in the Rose Garden, initially said he planned to use executive action and pointed to the border crisis as a reason to act -- blasting Republicans for using the surge of illegal immigrant kids as an ""excuse to do nothing.""
""Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn't make..."
"The Biden administration and a Pennsylvania school district urged a skeptical Supreme Court to let school districts suppress free speech by students on social media if they deem it potentially disruptive to school operations.
The case, Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L., court file 20-255, was heard April 28.
The Biden administration was represented in a 112-minute telephonic hearing by Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart.
The petitioner, the school district in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, was represented by Lisa S. Blatt. The student involved in the case, known in court..."
"President Donald Trump reacted Friday to Christianity Today magazine and an article it published endorsing impeachment.
Trump described the magazine as “far-left” and noted that although it was founded by Billy Graham, it had not been involved with the Graham family for years.
“A far-left magazine, or very ‘progressive,’ as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn’t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather have a..."
"As the Obamacare website continues to confound both users and government officials, three 20-something San Francisco-area programmers say they’ve created a much simpler and cost-effective version of the site.
Ning Liang, George Kalogeropoulos and Michael Wasser put their heads together and created thehealthsherpa.com, a website that addresses the biggest problems with the glitch-ridden healthcare.gov.
“They got it completely backwards in terms of what people want up front,” Liang told CBS News. “They want prices and benefits, so that they could make the decision.”"
"President Donald Trump injected fresh drama into an already tense meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations Friday, calling for Russia, ousted for its the annexation of Crimea, to be reinstated.
Trump made the comment at the White House Friday after hours of further escalating his rhetoric against longtime allies over U.S. trade practices.
""Why are we having a meeting without Russia in the meeting? Trump said. ""They should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table.""

"President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he’ll tap Rep. Mick Mulvaney to be his budget director, putting an ardent conservative in the job that has the most control over the size of the federal government.
Mr. Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican, was elected to Congress as part of the 2010 tea party wave, and carved out a role as one of House conservatives’ fiercest fighters for cutting spending."
"President Trump on Friday signed a more than $2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak’s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day.

"A new peer-reviewed study from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that in-school transmission of COVID-19 is ""extremely rare.""
In a collaborative study between Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, researchers discovered that among 11 school districts with nearly 100,000 staff and students, there were no instances of children passing the coronavirus to adults during in-person instruction. Researchers found just 32 cases of either kid-to-kid or adult-to-adult coronavirus transmission over nine weeks."
"I ended up in that particular Starbucks by accident, really. I’m glad I did, because a homeless woman taught me a valuable lesson about Christmas.
It was a few weeks ago and I had just finished catching up with one of my good friends over breakfast on the east side of New York City. We started walking to his office building, and as we did we strolled past the Starbucks. It seemed like the perfect place to park myself for the next two hours and work before I had to..."
"He wasn’t even on the ballot, but former President Donald Trump was the big loser on Election Day 2022.
A plethora of pre-Election Day polls showed Republicans with a healthy lead, and pollsters went so far as to predict a ‘red tsunami.’ Instead, it was more like a pink trickle.
“Definitely not a Republican wave, that’s for darn sure,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said as the results came in Tuesday.
With ballots nationwide still being counted, the GOP held a small lead in the House — although polls had shown..."
"Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Monday voiced support for $2,000 stimulus checks, diverging from some of his Republican Senate colleagues.
The House on Monday passed a measure in the $900 billion COVID-19 relief package that President Trump signed on Sunday night to give Americans making up to $75,000 direct payments of $2,000 – rather than an initial proposal of $600 – but it is unclear whether the Senate will vote to do the same.

"The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld Ohio’s process for purging voters from its rolls, siding with the state in a case that questioned its policy for maintaining its voter registration lists.
The court split 5-4 along ideological lines in its decision, and Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s swing vote, sided with the conservatives in the case.
With its decision Monday, the court reversed a ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals."
"The New York attorney general’s report on alleged sexual harassment by Gov. Andrew Cuomo was the result of a civil investigation, but it has since led to law enforcement officials opening criminal investigations with the possibility of Cuomo being arrested.
The big question is what – if anything – could the governor be charged with? On Sunday, Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple hinted at a possible result in the case involving Brittany Commisso, the executive assistant who brought the most serious allegations against the governor.
""It would probably be a misdemeanor, possibly a couple,"" Apple said..."
"A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled Tuesday that the federal ban against 18-20-year-olds buying handguns is unconstitutional.
The Majority Opinion by Judge Julius Richardson–joined by Bush 43-appointee Judge Stephen Agree–looked at militia laws in American history and the Founding Fathers’ views that an armed populace made an armed militia possible, allowing the latter to repel a tyrannical government, should the need arise: 
""So while the individual right of self-defense was “the central component” of the Second Amendment, the civic purpose “was codified” based on..."

"While more attention will be paid to Wednesday's inauguration of Joe Biden, the real drama this week may come when Senate committees hold confirmation hearings for several of the president-elect's Cabinet picks.
Confirmation hearings are often marked by partisan differences, and this week is likely to be no different. In November, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, expressed broad opposition to Biden's selections.
""Biden's cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be..."
"President Barack Obama glossed over some inconvenient truths Tuesday in his climate-change speech to the United Nations. For one, as the U.S. cleans up emissions at home, it’s sending dirty fuel abroad to pollute the same sky.
As well, the U.S. is not cleaning up quite as aggressively as Obama implied in his remarks.
Obama was among scores of world leaders at the gathering, which followed by days a mass demonstration in New York City in support of action to combat global warming. Among those who marched: Al Gore, whose..."

Klobuchar told campaign staff Monday she is ending her campaign, after a series of disappointing finishes in the four early nominating contests, news outlets reported.
She kicked off her 2020 campaign in February at an outdoor rally along the Mississippi riverfront in Minneapolis during a snowstorm, using the weather-related circumstances to argue she is tough enough to take on President Trump.
Trump weighed in via Twitter, questioning how global warming can be real when Klobuchar launched..."
"Public opinion on impeaching President Trump is shifting in House Democrats' favor as new polls show nearly half of the country supports their impeachment inquiry.

"As President Joe Biden limps into Glasgow, there are only two things holding back his big, showy climate agenda: politics and economics.
If you happen to be one of those people who insists that climate change should be “beyond politics,” then you are certainly entitled to the sentiment — but spare us any lectures about “democracy” in the future, because politics is how liberal-democratic societies go about their public business.
And the politics here do not favor dramatic action, whatever is said or notionally agreed to in Glasgow.

The 2020 election has been packed with wild news cycles and massive, 'game-changer' level events -- ranging from everything related to the global pandemic, to the massive resulting economic fallout, to racial tensions and dramatic social unrest, to a hugely consequential Supreme Court vacancy. That list merely scratches the surface, ignoring myriad all-consuming media tempests like Bob Woodward's book and Trump's tax returns, as well as more typical high-profile political events such as the major party conventions...."
"Democrats were cheered by the renewed FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and counted it as a win. Most Republicans were dismayed that the full Senate's vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was delayed and saw this as a political misstep.

"We learn from special counsel John Durham’s indictment of Igor Danchenko that “the FBI ultimately devoted substantial resources attempting to investigate and corroborate the allegations” in the now-infamous Steele dossier. “Ultimately” is right — but not before it relied on the shoddy document to surveil an American citizen in an investigation that produced the Mueller probe and a two-year-long obsession with Trump and Russian built on a preposterous foundation.
The web of deceit is a tangled one, but while the indictment details a shocking story of transnational dirty tricks weaponized at the highest level..."

"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he had only three items on his agenda Thursday for a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
“My agenda is very simple. It has only three items on it: weapons, weapons and weapons,” Mr. Kuleba said, standing next to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
Over the past month of fighting since Russia’s invasion, Ukraine has demonstrated it has the will to fight and the skill to blunt Russian advances and even turn back the assault, Mr. Kuleba said.
“But without sustainable and sufficient supplies of all weapons requested by Ukraine, these wins will be accompanied with enormous sacrifices,” he said. “The more weapons we get,..."
"President Obama will trade the ""magic"" of his 2008 campaign rhetoric for a ""pragmatic"" pitch for how he plans to restore economic security to America in his nomination address Thursday night, campaign officials said.
""Tonight is not about magic. It's about being pragmatic. It's about the future,"" an Obama official told Fox News, hours before the president was to deliver his speech before Democratic delegates and the nation at the party's convention in Charlotte, N.C. ""It's not about the rhetoric, it's about the vision.""

"Cuba’s communist regime is trying to blame the US for the huge uprising against its totalitarian government — as it also calls on “revolutionaries” to take to the streets and “fight” any anti-government protesters.
On Sunday, thousands took to the streets in cities and towns across the long-suffering nation, screaming “freedom” and “enough” — as well as anti-government slogans and demands for the removal of President Miguel Díaz-Canel.
The dictatorship responded with a huge police presence, dispatching special forces jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back.
Dozens of demonstrators were arrested..."
"The United States is in the midst of a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, with case numbers spiking in several states and the overall numbers showing an upward trend.
The New York Times noted that the Midwest and West are experiencing the biggest spike, although the number of COVID-19 cases is going up in many other parts of the country.
Ohio, for example, currently has more people hospitalized with the virus than at any other time during the pandemic, which started earlier this year. North Dakota has the most..."
"Matt Towery thought he’d retired from the polling business. But this election year has him feeling a little like Michael Corleone. Just when he thought he was out, he says, they pulled him back in.
Mr. Towery, a practicing attorney living in Florida, is a former columnist with Creators Syndicate and founder and chairman of InsiderAdvantage, a political news site. If people are eager to hear his take on this election, it’s because in 2016 Mr. Towery was among the very few pollsters who called it for Donald Trump. On..."
"The Trump presidency made a deep descent in December. The departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, the appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America has long been a “sucker” in world affairs all defined his presidency down."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned from his position on Tuesday, one week after state Attorney General Letitia James released a report that found he sexually harassed 11 women, including staffers and others who did not work for his administration.
""It was an honor to lead,"" Cuomo said in his closing remarks shortly following the announcement, noting that the transition will be effective ""in 14 days."" New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will be his replacement and will serve as the state's first female governor."
"Since the nation's founding, more than 1.1 million Americans have died fighting in our country's wars.
Think about that for a second: You could double the population of our largest city here in Alaska, Anchorage, and there would still be fewer people in this state than the number of patriots who have died in service to America.
Whether these honored dead repose in Arlington National Cemetery, somewhere closer to their homes and families, or halfway around the world, they deserve our thanks and utmost respect. It is, as President Abraham..."
"Last week, our military and intelligence services brought justice to Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s terror mastermind. President Trump ordered General Suleimani’s killing after months of attacks on Americans by Iran’s proxy forces in Iraq. These attacks culminated in a rocket strike that killed an American and wounded others, then the attempted storming of our embassy in Baghdad. The first attack crossed the red line drawn by the president last summer — that if Iran harmed an American, it would face severe consequences. The president meant what he said, as Mr. Suleimani..."
"President Trump has filed suit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an attempt to block congressional subpoenas for his business records.
The lawsuit by Trump, sons Donald Jr. and Eric and daughter Ivanka was filed Monday in federal court in New York. The Trump Organization and the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust are among the other plaintiffs.
Two House committees subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and several other financial institutions earlier this month as part of investigations into the Republican president’s finances.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said at..."
"A high-profile unionization effort by Amazon workers in Alabama fell short Friday, as Amazon easily passed the 1,608 votes needed at its 6,000-person warehouse in Bessemer.
An early count showed that workers opted against unionization by a 1,798-738 margin, out of 3,215 ballots cast. Only 55 percent of the 5,805 eligible voters ended up voting, and 500 ballots were contested and not counted in the tally.
After a lopsided count emerged on Thursday, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which organized the effort, complained publicly that “our system is..."
"Befitting Frank Sinatra’s centennial birthday and “Old Blue Eyes’” fascination with presidential politics (he helped orchestrate JFK’s and Ronald Reagan’s inaugurals), Tuesday’s GOP debate will occur at the Venetian Las Vegas. It sits atop the ruins of the Sands Hotel – in early 1960, home to the famed “summit” featuring Frank, Dean, Sammy and their ring-a-ding pals."
"President Obama will announce Tuesday that the U.S. military will take the lead in overseeing what has been a chaotic and widely criticized response to the worst Ebola outbreak in history, dispatching up to 3,000 military personnel to West Africa in an effort that could cost up to $750 million over the next six months, according to senior administration officials."
"A Texas law that bans most abortions took effect on Sept. 1 after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency motion that asked it to block the law.
Senate Bill 8 bars doctors from performing abortions unless he or she has tried detecting a fetal heartbeat. Only if a heartbeat is not detected can the doctor perform an abortion, unless a medical emergency exists.
The legislation explicitly forbids state officials from enforcing it. Instead, private citizens—except for an individual who impregnated a woman through rape or incest—may file lawsuits against doctors, clinics, and anyone involved..."
"Today’s New York Post reports that an email on a found computer indicating Joe Biden met with Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, while it employed his son. Whether or not you put a lot of faith in that particular email, the fact remains that Joe Biden does not believe that his son’s work on the board of Burisma, while he was directing the administration’s policies regarding Ukraine, represented a conflict of interest. In fact, the Democratic nominee contends Burisma was not trying to..."
"Elon Musk scored a legal victory in his battle against Twitter on Wednesday when a Delaware judge said she would let him add claims from a whistleblower to his countersuit against the social media giant — but denied the mogul’s request to delay the trial.

"All Things, it seems, will not be Considered. In the long and dishonorable annals of journalistic cant, there have been few statements to compete with the one issued by National Public Radio last week explaining why it wouldn’t burden its listeners with any news about Hunter Biden.

"President Trump announced he tested for the coronavirus on Friday night and is awaiting results.
As the White House Coronavirus Task Force gave a press conference on Saturday, Trump told reporters that he decided to take the test in response to Friday's press conference where the president declared a state of national emergency.

"A two-year long Justice Department investigation has found that Yale University illegally discriminated against Asian American and white applicants in violation of federal civil rights law.
In a letter to the college’s attorneys Thursday, the department said that Yale “rejects scores of Asian American and white applicants each year based on their race, whom it otherwise would admit.”
“Yale’s race discrimination imposes undue and unlawful penalties on racially-disfavored applicants, including in particular Asian American and White applicants,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, the head of the department’s civil rights division,..."
"Inflation cooled more than expected in October, but consumer prices remained near a multi-decade high, continuing to squeeze millions of U.S. households and small businesses.
The Labor Department said Thursday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 0.4% in October from the previous month. Prices climbed 7.7% on an annual basis. 
Those figures were both lower than the 8% headline figure and 0.5% monthly increase forecast by Refinitiv economists, a potentially reassuring sign for the Federal Reserve..."
"Increased stimulus checks remain in limbo in the Senate, where lawmakers are gathering Wednesday to begin the process of overriding President Trump’s veto of a critical defense bill.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked quick consideration of a House-passed bill to boost a new round of checks from $600 to $2,000 per individual.
Instead, he proposed a measure that would combine the House bill with provisions Trump has been seeking to repeal a Big Tech lawsuit liability shield and to create a commission to study the integrity of..."
"As Egypt descends into chaos, President Obama is facing increasing criticism that an ""incoherent"" policy toward the country -- much like U.S. policy toward Syria -- is putting U.S. money and influence on the line without a clear end-game.
The Obama administration claims to be staying neutral in the violent confrontation between the military-backed government and Muslim Brotherhood supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi. More than 500 people have been killed so far across the country.
""America cannot determine the future of Egypt,"" Obama said Thursday, in brief..."
"Most critics of Amazon and other world-bestriding technology companies focus on their size and market share, but another problem is their opacity: We still do not know, and may indeed never know, why Amazon has decided to ban Ryan Anderson’s book on the transgender controversy. Inquiries from National Review and from Anderson’s publisher, Encounter Books, have been met with Bourbon haughtiness: Le marché, c’est moi, says Jeff Bezos.
The book, published in 2018, recently has been removed from Amazon, as well as from Amazon subsidiaries Kindle, Audible, and AbeBooks. Amazon..."
"I repeat: I’m not a global warming believer. I’m not a global warming denier. I’ve long believed that it cannot be good for humanity to be spewing tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I also believe that those scientists who pretend to know exactly what this will cause in 20, 30 or 50 years are white-coated propagandists.

"Sentiment among home builders is plummeting as Americans’ demand for properties begins to slow, according to a Wednesday report.
The National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo’s Housing Market Index fell by two points to 67 in June, reaching its lowest level since June 2020 in its sixth consecutive month of declines. A value over 50 indicates that more builders see conditions as good rather than bad.
The drop in optimism reflects high inflation and lackluster economic activity. Material costs for residential construction are 19% greater year-over-year, while mortgage rates are soaring to their highest levels since 2008 —..."
"President Joe Biden launched a publicity tour touting his newly passed $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, but political operatives in both parties question whether it will move the needle for Democrats in the midterm elections.
Though Biden has not yet signed the bill into law, the White House is sending him to multiple cities across the country to deliver remarks on how the administration's investments will improve those particular communities, with the first coming last week in Baltimore.
Biden opened by discussing rampant inflation, which he called ""one of the most pressing..."
"President Joe Biden raised the refugee cap to 62,500 Monday following weeks of criticism that his administration was too slow in revising former President Donald Trump’s cap.
Trump ordered before leaving office that no more than 15,000 refugees could be accepted into the U.S. during the fiscal year 2021, a level both Biden and other Democrats criticized as far too low. The White House had previously said it would keep Trump’s cap in place for the time being, however, with the ultimate goal of setting a 125,000 refugee cap in..."
"Customs and Border Protection recorded 203,597 migrant encounters at the U.S.–Mexico border in August alone, bringing the total number of encounters for the fiscal year to more than 2 million for the first time ever, the agency announced on Monday.
Of those encounters, 157,921 were unique encounters, CBP said. The others involved illegal immigrants who had multiple encounters and had been expelled or deported.
The number is an increase from the 199,976 encounters in July. August 2021 saw 209,840 total migrant encounters.

"The recent surge in anti-Semitic outbursts from entertainment figures—most recently Nick Cannon—is troubling to people of goodwill.
As a Hollywood actor and entertainer who has starred in more than two dozen films and scores of television shows, Cannon is a high-profile cultural influencer. On a podcast released June 30, he chose to use his wide-reaching platform to share age-old conspiracy theories of Jewish deception and control.
ViacomCBS severed its ties with Cannon on Tuesday. He subsequently offered a public apology.
On the podcast, he decried “the Rothschilds, centralized banking, the..."
"There were nearly 4.7 million gun background checks run through the FBI’s national instant check system in March — the highest-ever monthly total in the more than 20 years since the system was set up.
The 4.69 million checks is a 25% increase from a then-record 3.69 million checks in March 2020, when there was a run on firearms as the scope of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming clearer.
The checks aren’t a one-to-one correlation to gun sales, but are used as a general approximation for the health of the..."
"Senate Democrats called on Republicans to denounce President Trump’s Tuesday morning tweet claiming a video of a police officer pushing a protester to the ground was “a set up.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and several other Republicans declined to comment on the tweet, while others criticized it or said it was part of Trump’s overall Twitter habit.
“That’s a disgrace,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday. “They can’t even speak out on that?”
Several Republicans criticized the tweet, among them Lisa Murkowski, of..."
"(CNSNews.com) -- Idaho's Gov. Brad Little (R) signed into law on Monday legislation that prohibits biological males from competing in female sports, thus barring ""transgender women"" from real women's sports.

"In honor of International Women’s Day, allow me to quote the statement made by Vladimir Lenin, who presided over the first official March 8th celebration of this day in Russia:
“For under capitalism the female half of the human race is doubly oppressed. The working woman and the peasant woman are oppressed by capital, but over and above that—they remain in ‘household bondage,’ they continue to be ‘household slaves,’ for they are overburdened with the drudgery of the most squalid, backbreaking and stultifying toil in the kitchen and the family..."

"The Supreme Court seemed open to the possibility of answering Mississippi’s call to scuttle Roe v. Wade, the perpetually controversial 1973 ruling that wrested the regulation of abortion from the states and made abortion lawful throughout the entire country.
Roe v. Wade is “an egregiously wrong decision,” Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart said during oral arguments on Dec. 1.
“Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey haunt our country,” Stewart said, referencing Roe’s companion ruling from 1992, which held states can’t impose significant restrictions on abortion before a fetus becomes viable for..."
"Immigrants living in the U.S. with serious criminal records can be held without bail while awaiting deportation even if ICE didn’t immediately pick them up when they were released from prison or jail, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
The 5-4 decision marked another rejection for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the liberal panel that covers the country’s West Coast and that has tested a number of legal theories on immigration law.
In this case, the 9th Circuit had ruled that under the law, if U.S. Immigration and Customs..."

"In the wake of the worst terrorist attack in America since 9/11, President Obama could have used his Oval Office address on Sunday night to announce different policies than the ones that have obviously failed to keep America safe from radical Islam.
He could have explained why a long-feared arrival of low-tech, soft-target terrorism had occurred, and what he would do to rectify the problem—beginning with apologizin"

"Trump campaign officials predicted on Tuesday that the president will win at least 10% of Black voters in November and more than 40% of Hispanics, improving his performance with both traditionally Democratic voting groups since 2016.
Campaign manager Bill Stepien and senior adviser Jason Miller pointed to internal data and public surveys such as the Emerson College national poll, which was conducted just after the Republican National Convention that featured many minorities in prime-time speaking slots.
The Emerson survey found 19% of Black voters supporting Mr. Trump, and 37% of..."

"The House of Representatives dealt a blow to President Donald Trump on Monday by rejecting his veto of a defense bill, setting the stage for the Senate to deliver the first veto override of his presidency.
The Democratic-controlled House voted 322-87 to override Trump's veto of the $740.5 billion bill, with 109 members of the president's own party siding with Democrats.

"France is holding strong in its efforts to tax tech giants, many from the U.S., despite the looming threat of retaliatory tariffs from the Trump administration.
France landed in the crosshairs of the president’s global trade war after lawmakers there approved a bill this week that would impose a 3% tax on revenue generated by tech companies that provide digital services to French users. The tax would apply to digital companies with global revenue of at least $845 million or €750 million, and sales of $28 million or €25 million..."
"A federal judge issued an injunction on Friday ordering the Biden administration to cease accepting applications to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The program, initially established in 2012 under the Obama administration, allows illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to defer deportation for two years and to renew the deferral, as well as to receive work permits. DACA recipients are not granted a path to citizenship.
The Department of Homeland Security “violated the [Administrative Procedure Act] with the creation of DACA and its continued operation,” Judge..."

Durham left the courthouse without commenting but issued a prepared statement a short time later."

He promised that Israel would “would extract a very heavy price from Hamas” in response to repeated rocket attacks that have killed at least seven Israelis. In addition to the rockets that landed in Israel or were intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defense..."
"Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday blasted net neutrality as “the biggest regulatory threat to the Internet” in reaction to President Obama’s request to the Federal Communications Commission to create new rules of the road.
“In short, net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet,” the Texas Republican and possible 2016 presidential contender said in a statement distributed by his office. “It puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities and higher..."
"In a newly released Project Veritas video, footage reveals ABC Correspondent David Wright admitting the network doesn’t care about newsworthy stories.
“I feel terrible about it. I feel that the truth suffers, the voters are poorly informed, and people also have the opportunity to tune into whatever they want to hear,” Wright said. “And so, it’s like there’s no upside, or our bosses don’t see an upside in doing the job we’re supposed to do, which is to speak truth to power and hold people accountable.”
While Wright says he..."
"Two senators—a Democrat and a Republican—will on Tuesday officially unveil a sweeping legislative proposal to regulate cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.
“As a former state treasurer, I am excited by the possibilities of incorporating digital assets into the American financial system. The legislation that @SenGillibrand and I are proposing will do just that,” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo) said in a tweet, referring to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), co-sponsor of the crypto bill.
In a separate tweet, Lummis shared an article from Bitcoin Magazine, which featured a link to the draft legislation, called the Responsible Financial..."
"You're already aware that MSNBC -- America's self-appointed racist dog whistle truth squad -- oddly chose not to air numerous speeches delivered by racial minorities at last night's Republican convention. They have a narrative to protect, and all that. But the Left-wing cable news channel isn't the only outlet following Chris Matthews down the path of unhinged and shameless race-baiting."
"President Joe Biden signed an executive order Sunday that includes a provision to “provide voting access” to U.S. citizens in federal custody.

"The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is ready to re-implement the Trump-era ""Remain-in-Mexico"" policy in response to a court order to do so, after making changes to secure the agreement of the Mexican government – while still seeking to abolish the program entirely.
""As required by a federal court order, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been working in good faith to re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. ""Today, in coordination with the Departments of State and Justice, DHS..."

Finalized during a rare weekend session, the legislation, which is called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, clocks in at 2,702 pages. The $1.2 trillion bill includes approximately $550 billion in..."
"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday defended his criticism that Hillary Clinton’s campaign success is based largely on her being a female candidate and dismissed assertions about him having a soft foreign policy.
“The only card she has is the woman card,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday.” “Even women don’t like her. If she were not a woman, she would not even be in this race.”
The billionaire businessman resumed his Clinton attack following his sweep in five Northeast primary contests, saying Tuesday that “the only card she has..."
"The Supreme Court took up its first major gun control case in nearly a decade on Monday, hearing arguments in a dispute between a gun advocacy group and New York over a statute that restricted the transportation of firearms outside city limits -- even when licensed, locked and unloaded.
The city's statute was later amended but the court heard arguments over the original measure anyway, in a case that could have ramifications for local gun laws. The fact the high court even considered the case -- New York State Rifle..."
"ROME — The Vatican’s doctrinal office stated Monday that the Church has no power to bless homosexual unions, noting that God Himself “does not and cannot bless sin.”
In its formal reply to the “dubium” (question) “Does the Church have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons of the same sex?”, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) responded: “Negative.”
As signs “of spiritual effects that are achieved through the Church’s intercession,” blessings require both “the right intention of those who participate” and “that what..."
"OTTAWA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will remain in power but voters reduced his Liberal Party to a minority government Monday night.
The Liberals took 156 seats of the 338 in the Canadian House of Commons. With less than 50% of the seats in the House, Trudeau must reach out to the socialist New Democratic Party or the Quebec separatist Bloc Québécois to govern. In terms of the popular vote, the Conservatives outpolled the Liberals 34% to 33%."
"For all those politicians who were piling on Chick-fil-A last week, there are a bunch more rolling out the red carpet for the chicken chain.

"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee will join the already-crowded field of Democratic candidates for president, he announced Friday.
“We went to the moon and created technologies that have changed the world — our country’s next mission must be to rise up to the most urgent challenge of our time: defeating climate change,” Inslee says in a video announcement.
The 68-year-old governor will officially launch his bid in Seattle on Friday.
He plans to stand out from the field by focusing on climate change.
Inslee joins Sens. Cory Booker of New..."
"On the menu today: This week, in the span of 24 hours, the Biden administration’s position flipped from supporting a transfer of Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainians to opposing and blocking the move. The only explanation from the Pentagon is that there isn’t a “substantive rationale for it,” which will surprise the Polish and the Ukrainians. There are a few potential explanations for the administration’s sudden reversal — but none of them are good.
Very little makes sense about the U.S. government’s seemingly last-minute decision to oppose the..."
"President Donald Trump kicked Beto O'Rourke on his way out of the presidential primary race on Friday during his rally in Tupelo, Mississippi.
""Oh did you hear? Beto,"" Trump said to his audience.

""Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?"" Trump said. ""But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said what the hell is he doing? What is he on?"""
"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized Pfizer booster shots for people above the age of 65 or who are at high risk. 
In a press release sent to Fox Business, the FDA said it has approved a single booster shot for certain people to be administered at least six months after receiving their first two doses. 
These groups include individuals 65 years and older, and individuals ages 18 to 64 who are either at ""high risk of severe COVID-19"" or who work in high-risk places. 
""Today’s action demonstrates that science..."
"Ted Cruz wasn’t going to shovel your driveway.
Senator Cruz (R., Texas) is the subject of this week’s ritual denunciation for the grievous sin of taking his daughters to Cancun, rather than stay in Texas and endure the snow and blackouts with the shivering little people.
Cruz’s stock is not trading at an all-time high on my personal exchange these days, but the senator’s critics are, in this case, off-base. People who can take care of themselves and their families in an emergency should take care of themselves and their..."
"President Biden took a victory lap after the passage of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal, calling it “a monumental step forward for the nation,” and then he set his sights on the next, bigger goal.
White House officials said the hard-fought and long-delayed legislative win gave Democrats momentum for the rest of Mr. Biden‘s ambitious agenda, namely a $1.75 trillion bill that would be a historic expansion of the welfare state. The big bill, however, remains deeply mired in intraparty fighting in Congress.
Mr. Biden’s team on Sunday said that with infrastructure out of the way, the..."
"Another 1.9 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total of jobless claims since the coronavirus pandemic began up to 42 million.

"A love story for the men and women of our Armed Forces.
Editor’s Note: This article is adapted from Tom Cotton’s new book, Sacred Duty: A Soldier’s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery.
The story of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier begins on the battlefields of Europe as the guns fell silent on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.

"Additional COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are not needed for the general population, leading scientists including two departing senior U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials and several from the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an article published in a medical journal on Monday.
The scientists said more evidence was needed to justify boosters. That view disagrees with U.S. government plans to begin offering another round of shots to many fully vaccinated Americans as soon as next week, contingent on approval from health regulators.

"House Republicans voted Wednesday evening to authorize an unprecedented lawsuit against President Obama, escalating a separation of powers battle between Congress and the White House that is heavily tinged with election-year politics.
Mr. Obama mocked Republicans, telling them to “stop just hatin’ all the time,” but GOP lawmakers said they felt boxed in, being unable to get their legislation through the Democrat-controlled Senate and having to watch as the president tweaks, waives or ignores laws Congress has written but which he dislikes."
"As coronavirus cases spike across Florida, dozens of hospitals in the state have announced that their intensive-care units are at capacity and many more warn that they are dangerously low on beds to handle the influx of new virus patients.

"The U.S. economy saw solid job growth in April, suggesting the labor market is still strong despite headwinds from rising interest rates, soaring inflation, a worsening labor shortage and fears of a slowdown. 
Employers added 428,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, beating the 391,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists.

Paul Allard Hodgkins, 38, was the first person charged with a felony to be sentenced.

""There's nothing new that we're doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president,"" Biden said before he signed the order, charging Trump with making the two ""more inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify.""
The order, which the Biden administration touted as an effort to ""reverse attacks"" on President Barack Obama's signature achievement, instructs the Health and..."

"It was an enormous shock to learn that Colin Powell died at 84 of complications from COVID-19.
His devotion to duty, commitment to America, and innate sense of dignity and decency made him seem ageless and timeless. 
We live near the Powells in McLean, Virginia. Our pictures hang side-by-side at Simon’s Shoe and Luggage Repair. As a four-star general, secretary of state and national security adviser, Powell wandered around town as a normal citizen. He greeted one and all with courtesy and kindness."
"The family of a Texas woman who once portrayed Aunt Jemima has called on the breakfast brand to reconsider its decision to scrap the ubiquitous portrait from its products.
Vera Harris said the family takes pride in Quaker Oats scouting her second cousin Lillian Richard to become a brand representative in 1925, news station KLTV reported.

"Every afternoon when they arrive home from kindergarten, Emma Burnett’s twin five-year-old daughters complain about how difficult it was to breathe in their masks all day.
Burnett, like many moms in Connecticut, was very Covid-19 conscious at first, accepting the state restrictions as a necessary evil to combat the spread of an ominous disease.
But as the Delta wave came and went in the fall of 2021, vaccine uptake soared, and scientific data supporting school masking started to dwindle, all while the teachers’ unions continued to insist that kids had to cover their faces..."
"It’s interesting how we move from the self-sacrifice of soldiers who’ve died for our freedoms into a month of self-obsession from LGBT activists who demand we give up our freedoms. We go from memorializing the courageous to merchandising the outrageous. In the process, we’re told to be good automatons and embrace “equality.”
But are things really becoming more equal? 
Corporate America doesn’t rebrand itself for a whole month in red, white, and blue to show any devotion to the USA. They don’t ever celebrate America’s rich religious heritage. They don’t..."

"For an hour in a largely empty room, Gov. Greg Abbott and challenger Beto O’Rourke locked horns over Texas’ most contentious issues in the first and last debate of the governor’s race.
There was no live audience to witness the two fire shots at one another over their accused failings, occasionally speaking over their time limits — and one another.
It was the first time the candidates met in person since O’Rourke stormed the governor’s press conference after the tragic Uvalde elementary school shooting.
The candidates grappled over border security, gun laws, school safety,..."
"President Biden on Friday released his massive $6 trillion budget for fiscal 2022 pushing a surge in spending on social programs and broadly defined infrastructure through tax hikes on businesses and higher-earners.
The budget — which would set the US on course for higher spending as a percent of the economy than ever before and continue to balloon the national debt — calls for a 16-percent increase in non-defense spending. But it’s also an aspirational document that requires Congress to enact it.
Critics of Biden’s first budget say it would undermine the..."
"Hillary Clinton harshly criticizes Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in a new documentary and told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published on Tuesday that she would not commit to backing him if he becomes the Democrats' nominee for president in the upcoming election.

"New York City will be ending its private sector vaccine mandate starting Nov. 1 as the city continues to lift pandemic-related restrictions.
Democratic Mayor Eric Adams announced Tuesday the mandate will end Nov. 1 for private employees but will remain in place for public employees, according to NBC 4 New York.
“Our vaccinated workforce kept the city open and operating, with over 300,000 employees it was crucial to put it in place and we’re keeping it in place,” Adams reportedly said. “Our vaccinated workers have carried out their jobs and stepped up when..."
"He was not on the ballot, but former President Trump was one of the winners in Maryland’s Republican primary for governor.
So was the Democratic Governors Association, whose seven-figure investment in the GOP contest appeared to pay off.
The candidate Trump was backing in the Republican primary, state Delegate Dan Cox, captured the party’s nomination in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Larry Hogan in blue state Maryland.
Cox defeated Kelly Schulz, a former state lawmaker who had served as Maryland’s secretary of labor (2015-2019) and secretary of commerce (2019–2022) in the..."
"Poor Bernie Sanders! The youth vote failed to show up for him. The youth vote always fails to show up — it will break your heart every time. Senator Sanders didn’t lose to Joe Biden — he lost to Tinder, weed, and The Resident. The kids were doing themselves a favor — young people have more of a future for Senator Sanders and his coterie of socialist dingbat malefactors to ruin.
Arising from the tumult, triumphant, was the dotty figure of Joe Biden. Biden and Sanders vying for the Democratic..."
"The decision to not prosecute NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Eric Garner’s death was ultimately made by Attorney General William Barr himself — because of “insufficient evidence” in the case, Brooklyn’s top prosecutor announced Tuesday.
US Attorney Richard Donoghue said that after an extensive five-year investigation, the Department of Justice couldn’t prove that Pantaleo “acted in willful violation of the law” — while noting that Garner was not in a chokehold when he repeatedly gasped, “I can’t breathe.”"
"Former President Trump said if he formally announces a 2024 White House bid and is re-elected, he would return to the nation’s capital with experience and a new perspective, without having to rely on Washington insiders, and would build on his ""unbeatable"" America First record.

"President Trump was made aware of the whistleblower complaint regarding his interactions with Ukraine before he released military aid to the country, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.
The complaint alleged that Trump improperly leveraged U.S. military aid to coerce the opening of politically beneficial investigations during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. While the whistleblower did not listen to the call firsthand, the individual was alarmed by what he had learned of the call’s contents and the extra security with which the transcript of..."

"The Supreme Court ruled Monday that an 1868 treaty between with the Crow Indians is still valid and grants tribe members hunting rights on some federal lands, breathing new life into Indian-U.S. relations.
Wyoming had charged Clayvin Herrera, a member of the Crow, with offseason hunting in 2014 after state officials discovered him other tribe members hunting bull elk on the Big Horn National Forest, discarding the bodies and only taking the heads for trophies.
Mr. Herrera argued he was permitted to hunt on the land, citing the treaty which..."
"Iraq’s prime minister asked Iran's leaders to rein in Iran-backed militias in Iraq and in a strongly worded message to Tehran, suggested he would confront the factions, two Iraqi officials said Wednesday.

While the policies were announced in November, enforcement has not yet begun due..."

Over Memorial Day Weekend, former Obama White House speechwriter Jon Favreau attempted to pin the blame of the harsh and brutal conditions for children and families at immigrant detention centers on President Trump.

"Without naming names, I made an observation on Saturday night, based on the social choices of a shocking number of the people I follow on Instagram -- many of whom are young and healthy.

I was taken aback:"

"President Trump's phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is deeply problematic. But Joe Biden's decision to allow his son, Hunter, to travel with him on a 2013 trip to China is a problem for the former vice president.

While NBC says there are no indications Hunter met with Chinese government officials during the visit, it notes that Hunter attended some formal events with his father. NBC..."

"Another wave of coronavirus cases is sweeping across the country and schools nationwide are shifting back to virtual classes.
Based on a growing body of evidence, researchers suggest that schools do not serve as hot spots or major points of spread for COVID-19. Instead, they argue the number of cases in schools reflect both the infection rates and social distancing policies of their surrounding communities. The data suggests schools can remain open to in-person instruction with adequate policies in place.

"The far-left fumed over an initial draft from Democrat President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court Commission on the issue of packing the Supreme Court, an idea that the report cautioned against.
“Court expansion is likely to undermine, rather than enhance, the Supreme Court’s legitimacy and its role in the constitutional system, and there are significant reasons to be skeptical that expansion would serve democratic values,” the report said, later adding, “Court expansion today could lead to a continuous cycle of future expansions.”

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and endorsed by Biden — would increase tax revenue by $16.7 billion from Americans earning less than $200,000 a year, according to a nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) published Friday. Nearly every tax bracket would pay more in taxes with those making below $10,000..."

Senate Democrats signaled that they will block the legislation, claiming that the bill is “half-assed” and does not reach far enough.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Carr told Axios in what was described as his strongest rebuke of..."
"Amid the dire Covid warnings, one crucial fact has been largely ignored: Cases are down 77% over the past six weeks. If a medication slashed cases by 77%, we’d call it a miracle pill. Why is the number of cases plummeting much faster than experts predicted?
In large part because natural immunity from prior infection is far more common than can be measured by testing. Testing has been capturing only from 10% to 25% of infections, depending on when during the pandemic someone got the virus. Applying a time-weighted case..."

Gone is the big crowd of 20 cheerful hopefuls who gathered on a glittering stage in Miami over two nights for the very first Democratic debate seven months ago, strutting their stuff and shaking hands before a mesmerized media.
The debate would be “the largest gathering of liberals since Woodstock,” predicted Ross Baker, a distinguished political science professor at Rutgers University — and he was right."
"Who needs conventions, who needs crowded arenas? Democrats used the magic of technology and clever casting to give their party a passable first night.
Forced by the coronavirus to create a make-believe gathering, planners employed all of Silicon Valley’s bells and whistles to present a simulated intimacy involving both ordinary people and party stars.

For some in media, the difference between 30 minutes and five pages is enough to suggest — or declare outright — that a White House conspiracy is afoot, reminding us again that our press is one of the least trustworthy sources of information during complicated and fast-moving news cycles.
""The transcript text is right around 2,000 words, and..."
"The House passed a $1.5 trillion government funding bill Wednesday night, setting the first new spending levels under the Biden administration, providing $13.6 billion in measures to support Ukraine, and marking the end of months of bipartisan budget negotiations.
Separately, the House passed a short-term stopgap measure that funds the government at current levels after the Friday deadline through March 15. That gives the Senate more time to consider and act on the omnibus funding measure.
Passage came after a long and chaotic day of delays and last-minute snags. A..."
"President Obama on Thursday expressed strong support for Senate Democrats’ move to enact the so-called “nuclear option” and alter congressional rules to clear the way for judicial and other executive nominees.
“Enough is enough,” the president said during remarks in the White House press briefing room. “I’m a former senator. So is my vice president. We both value any senator’s duty to advise and consent. It’s important we take that very seriously. But a few now refuse to treat that duty of advise and consent with the respect it..."
"D.C. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan issued an order Tuesday indicating he'll soon accept ""amicus curiae,"" or ""friend of the court"" submissions, in the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn -- drawing immediate scrutiny and a planned ethics complaint against Sullivan, who had previously refused to hear amicus briefs in the case.
Sullivan's order indicated that an upcoming scheduling order would clarify the parameters of who specifically could submit the amicus briefs, which are submissions by non-parties that claim an interest in the case. Sullivan specifically said he..."
"As she makes her exit from the Wyoming Republican Senate primary official, Liz Cheney is citing illness in her family as the chief reason for ending her challenge to veteran Sen. Mike Enzi.
But also working strongly against the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney was history. Whatever the state, Republicans historically don't like to dump their incumbent U.S. senators.
Since World War II, roughly 11 Republican senators have gone down to defeat in their own party primaries. In contrast, Democratic senators were given a thumbs-down by their own..."
"President Trump is said to be zeroing in on Amy Coney Barrett as a nominee to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court, though the president has said he is considering five candidates, according to reports.
Barrett, a Midwestern Catholic and favorite of pro-life advocates, had separate meetings with Trump and White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Monday, sources told Bloomberg. Many inside the White House, as well as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, would support the nomination of Barrett, a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court..."
"The Senate Wednesday passed a bill aimed at increasing U.S. competition with China by a 64-33 vote, sending the $250 billion measure to the House of Representatives.
The bill, officially called the CHIPS Act of 2022, cleared a 60-vote cloture hurdle Tuesday, setting it on course to easily pass Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she plans to take up the bill quickly and send it to President Biden's desk. 
""It’s been a long journey to get to this point, but history will show that by passing this CHIPS-Plus bill,..."
"Tone-deaf. White people-pleasing. Bumbling pineapple bun. These are just some of the choice epithets that have been hurled at Andrew Yang after he shared his thoughts about the Asian American experience in the age of coronavirus. Calling the growing reports of racist and xenophobic attacks against Asian Americans across the country a ‘heartbreaking phenomenon‘, Yang opened his op-ed with a soliloquy about a recent experience at a grocery store where, for the first time since growing up as one of the few children of East-Asian descent in a New York..."
"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, now at the starting line of a general election race, traded shots across the capital Friday in dueling addresses before two very different D.C. audiences -- each warning the other would take the country backward.
Trump headlined the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” summit while Clinton addressed a Planned Parenthood national conference."
"The suspect who attempted to breach an FBI office in Cincinnati was killed by law enforcement during an hours-long standoff, Ohio police announced Thursday afternoon.
The man was identified as Ricky Walter Shiffer, who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, sources told CNN.
The suspect was shot and killed by officers after he raised his weapon at law enforcement after unsuccessful negotiation tactics, police said, according to NewsNation's Evan Lambert.
Northbound Interstate 71 was shut down after the suspect fired a nail gun at law enforcement, held up an AR-15-style rifle, and..."
"As we went to press, it looked like Israel and Hamas would put down their arms—for now. The truce comes less than two weeks after the terrorist group commenced its 4,000-rocket barrage on Israeli civilians—the most intense since it took over the Gaza strip in 2007. Israel’s leadership wouldn’t have approved a cease-fire if it hadn’t accomplished most of what it wanted through air strikes, but the question now is what lessons the region’s players take from the short war and the world’s response.
The cease-fire has no strings attached,..."
"A Senate vote on Thursday indicated strong bipartisan support for more targeted stimulus checks in the next COVID-19 relief package.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, proposed an amendment that called for ""targeting"" checks and making sure that ""upper-income taxpayers are not eligible.""
The Senate voted 99-1 in support of the amendment. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only person to vote against it.
""I don't think a single person on this floor would disagree to target the relief to our neighbors who are struggling to pay..."

"Andrew Cuomo on Saturday declared a state of emergency ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Henri and called out 500 National Guard troops to respond to the storm, in one of his final acts before he steps down from office Monday at midnight.
“This is as serious as a heart attack,” Cuomo said during a midday press conference of the storm, which could deal a direct blow to eastern Long Island when it hits sometime Sunday.
Cuomo noted that the relatively short warning people have gotten about Henri might catch some off..."
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) has declared a state of emergency as Hurricane Henri approaches New York. Cuomo deployed 500 National Guard troops on Saturday, detailing plans ahead of the life-threatening storm’s arrival.
The National Hurricane Center reported that more than 42 million people in the region have been placed under hurricane or tropical storm warnings as Henri could make landfall in Eastern Long Island sometime on Sunday.
The governor is expected to leave office on Aug. 23 and has continued to dodge questions regarding his sexual harassment scandal while discussing..."
"Sen. Jim DeMint said Thursday hell resign from the Senate to go run the Heritage Foundation, the powerhouse conservative think tank that dominates Republican policy circles.
“Its been an honor to serve the people of South Carolina in United States Senate for the past eight years, but now its time for me to pass the torch to someone else and take on a new role in the fight for Americas future, Mr. DeMint said in a statement announcing the news.

"President Trump said Friday night that he supported a coronavirus response package negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in an apparent effort to get skeptical House Republicans on board with the legislation.

"Jeffrey Epstein’s victims have another shot at justice. Here’s hoping they get it.
Ghislaine Maxwell, the alleged child sex trafficker and abuser in league with Epstein, was finally arrested Thursday morning.
Her guilt, in the court of public opinion, isn’t in question.
The only question is: Will the federal government keep Maxwell alive to stand trial?"
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will announce this week whether she will create a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, her spokesman said.
The California Democrat told colleagues about her plans during a meeting of the House Steering and Policy Committee on Tuesday, which comes weeks after Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have created a commission to dig into the attack on Congress.
Multiple news outlets reported the speaker revealed she would create the committee, which would not require GOP support. But Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, quickly tweeted..."
"Russia has outlined plans to seize the entire Donbas and the south of Ukraine in the second phase of its offensive to create a land corridor stretching to Moldova.
The deputy commander of Russia's central military district, Rustam Minnekayev, said Russia planned to forge a corridor between Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014, and the Donbas in eastern Ukraine.
The remaining Ukrainian fighters left in the port city of Mariupol are holed up at the vast Azovstal industrial facility which Putin has ordered to be blockaded, effectively condemning the soldiers..."
"Netflix solidified its reputation as a liberal entertainment powerhouse with the announcement Monday that former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have signed on to produce a raft of new programming for the content conduit under their Higher Ground Productions shingle, and some conservative consumers aren't happy about it."
"With COVID cases in the country rising as the Delta variant spreads, the best thing political and public-health leaders can do is encourage the hesitant to get vaccinated. Yet many are instead undermining confidence in the shots, which have proven overwhelmingly effective against the new strain.
That’s the message sent by calling for — and in some cases instituting — a return to mask mandates, even for the vaxxed.
“Indoor mask use in NYC is falling — in delis, stores, subways, movie theaters etc. We need to reverse this trend,” tweeted Mark Levine (D-Manhattan), who..."
"President Biden on Wednesday said that as U.S. intelligence officials have “coalesced around two likely scenarios” for how COVID-19 originated, he has tasked the intelligence community with redoubling their investigative efforts to bring the U.S. closer to a “definitive conclusion” within 90 days.
The president noted that when the virus first emerged he called on the CDC, as a presidential candidate, to “get access to China to learn about the virus so we could fight it more effectively.” 
“The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those early months will..."
"On Monday, a federal judge struck down the unpopular and ridiculous mask mandate for airplanes and other modes of public transportation .
Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who sits on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida,  wrote that ""the [mandate] exceeded the CDC’s statutory authority, improperly invoked the good cause exception to notice and comment rulemaking, and failed to adequately explain its decisions. Because 'our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends,' the Court declares unlawful and vacates the [mask mandate].""
Mizelle underscored the importance of the government following..."
"Mexican officials, assisted by the gun-control group Brady United, filed a lawsuit against several U.S.-based firearm manufacturers alleging that these companies encouraged gun trafficking into Mexico. Mexico seeks $10 billion in damages and injunctive relief. They claim the firearm manufacturers are responsible for the rampant crime, corruption, and uncontrolled murders being committed in Mexico by Mexican drug cartels.
These allegations are baseless. The Mexican government is responsible for its failure to enforce its own laws and control rampant crime and corruption within its own borders and government.
The lawsuit is the anti-gun..."
"A British politician was stabbed to death Friday by a man who stormed into a church where the MP was meeting constituents — with police not ruling out terrorism.
David Amess, a lawmaker in British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party, was killed by a man who was arrested as armed police swooped into the church in Essex around midday, officials said.
“He was stabbed several times,” John Lamb, a local councilor at the scene, told Reuters of the 69-year-old member of Parliament."
"President Trump on Thursday ripped reports that he made a promise to a foreign leader so troubling that a whistleblower reported it to the intelligence community’s in-house watchdog — calling them “Fake News” and “Presidential Harassment!”
“Another Fake News story out there – It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various US agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!” Trump wrote in one of a series of three..."
"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he doesn’t know much about QAnon, a community that follows a person or group that is said to have high-level access inside the U.S. government and disseminates conspiracy theories.
“Well I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,” the president told reporters in Washington when asked about QAnon."
"Sen. Bernard Sanders, Sen. Kamala D. Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised campaign cash much faster than they spent it this year, according to federal reports filed Monday, demonstrating that their operations can go the distance in a presidential race.
Mr. Buttigieg, who has surged in the polls and scored an impressive $7 million in contributions, collected the cash 10 times faster than his campaign spent it. The Indiana mayor still had $6 million in the bank as he started the second quarter.
“That is a remarkably low..."
"It all comes down to intent.
]On Monday morning, the prosecution and defense will sum up to the jury in the murder trial of fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for allegedly causing the death of George Floyd last Memorial Day. Minneapolis is on tenterhooks, as are other major cities across the country, because it is inevitable that the radical Left will riot. If Chauvin is convicted of murder, the rioting will be portrayed as an affirmation that the nation’s police are hunting down young black men. If Chauvin is..."
"President Obama and Hillary Clinton have intensified attacks on Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, accusing him of manipulating voters’ “fear and ignorance” and using anti-Muslim rhetoric that helps recruit Islamic State terrorists — jabs that appear to be energizing his supporters and strengthening his campaign."
"President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee on March 22 refused to define what a woman is or say whether she agreed that punishments for possessing or distributing child pornography should be strengthened.
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was asked during day 2 of her confirmation hearings whether she could provide a definition of the word “woman.”
“No, I can’t,” Jackson said.
“I’m not a biologist,” she added.
Jackson sits on the board of Georgetown Day School, where students as young as 5 are taught they can choose to be a different gender, Sen...."
"Over 20 House and Senate Democrats have demanded the top executive at Google restrict search engine results showing pro-life pregnancy centers.
The lawmakers called pregnancy centers that do not offer abortions “fake clinics.”
In a letter to Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, the lawmakers wrote, “Directing women towards fake clinics that traffic in misinformation and don’t provide comprehensive health services is dangerous to women’s health and undermines the integrity of Google’s search results.”
The letter, which was spearheaded by Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, was signed..."
"The Supreme Court dismissed the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Thursday.
A seven-justice majority, with Justice Stephen Breyer authoring the opinion and Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissenting, issued a narrow ruling that the Republican-led states, such as Texas, which filed the suit had not suffered the harm that would have given them standing to challenge the legislation."
"Two Senate committees are set to meet Tuesday in the first public congressional inquiry into the Jan. 6 Capitol security failures that allowed a pro-Trump mob to storm the building as lawmakers were certifying the presidential election results in a joint session.

Invited to the hearing are Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee and the three former..."
"President Biden blasted last month’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade as “an exercise in raw political power” and a “giant step backwards” Friday before signing an executive order meant to help women seeking the procedure — though it is unlikely to have much effect in practice.
“This was not a decision driven by the Constitution,” Biden said of the June 24 high court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down the 49-year-old precedent set by Roe. “Let me say it again. This was not a decision driven..."
"The heat over Indiana's new religious objections law spread Friday across social media and to the White House as many local officials and business groups around the state tried to jump in and stem the fallout.
Use of the hashtag #boycottindiana spread across Twitter, spurred on by activists such as ""Star Trek"" actor George Takei, who argued that the measure opens the door to legalized discrimination against gay people. Apple CEO Tim Cook also tweeted his objections, saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the Indiana law.
Supporters of the bill..."
"Steve Bannon was indicted by a federal grand jury for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
The announcement comes weeks after the former White House chief strategist declined to cooperate with congressional investigators, citing former President Donald Trump's claims of executive privilege. The assertions of executive privilege are being cut down by the Biden administration as well as the courts and add pressure on other allies of Trump to comply with the House panel's subpoenas.
""Stephen K. Bannon was indicted today by a..."
"Federal prosecutors in Delaware are investigating Hunter Biden for potential tax crimes, he said in a statement issued Wednesday through his father’s presidential transition team.
“I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Biden said in the statement.
“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit..."
"Senate Democrats are set to announce a new push for single-payer healthcare on Wednesday featuring several 2020 hopefuls touting legislation from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to expand Medicare to everyone.
But divisions remain in the Democratic caucus over whether government-run healthcare may be going too far. Some of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats running for re-election in 2018 are not offering a warm embrace of the policy."
"Multiple gunmen opened fire at the Canadian Parliament complex, shooting at least one soldier and spraying as many as 30 shots inside the government building just two days after a terror attack in Quebec shook the nation, officials said.
The shots rang out just before 10 a.m., and were quickly followed by reports of ""several shooting incidents in downtown Ottawa,"" according to a tweet from police. The shooting at the government complex came after witnesses said they saw two men jump out of a Toyota Corolla and run toward the..."
"Diehard supports of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) have long believed that the mainstream media finds subtle ways to undermine their candidate—and occasionally their suspicions are well supported. Tuesday night's Democratic debate provided another one of these moments, as the progressive believe-all-victims mantra led CNN's Abby Phillip to presume the truth of the unproven accusation that Sanders privately told Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) that a woman couldn't win the presidency.
The accusation surfaced over the weekend, with the media citing unnamed sources—likely members of the Warren campaign—who claimed that Sanders made..."
"The Supreme Court temporarily blocked Texas's controversial, Republican-backed social media law that would have banned major platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube from censoring most content.
In a 5-4 vote Tuesday, the justices granted an emergency request from tech industry associations to block a lower court order that would have allowed the law to take hold, pending legal challenges.
H.B. 20, a Republican-backed anti-Big Tech law that stops social media companies from restricting users due to their political beliefs, was reinstated by a federal appeals court earlier this month, paving the way temporarily for Texans to..."
"The Supreme Court on Monday declined to step in to halt the release of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns from Manhattan prosecutors who are probing the Trump Organization.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is investigating alleged insurance and bank fraud by Trump’s real estate company and has subpoenaed eight years’ worth of financial records from Trump’s accounting firm Mazars USA LLP.

In a statement responding to the Supreme Court’s decision, Vance’s office said, “The work..."
"Attorney General William Barr said he had rejected the idea of appointing a special counsel either to investigate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, or to look into President Trump’s allegations of voter fraud, and said he did not believe that the federal government should seize any voting machines either.

"“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Elon Musk explains. Hear, hear!
Whatever Twitter’s potential, it’s a potent forum already — but far from a free-speech icon. And Musk’s takeover bid (he’s offered $43 billion) aims to fix that.
That’s throwing Twitter’s censorious staff into a tizzy. They just can’t handle the idea of letting people say things they don’t like to hear.
Hence the company’s..."
"More than 130 Secret Service agents assigned to protecting the White House or President Trump are isolating after they tested positive for the coronavirus or had contact with an infected colleague, according to a new report.
The outbreak has been linked to the slew of rallies that Trump did in the weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election and has sidelined approximately 10 percent of the agency’s core security team, the Washington Post reported Friday."
"In another nod to primary rival Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton is proposing to increase federal money for community health centers and outlining steps to expand access to health care across the nation.
Clinton’s campaign says the proposal is part of her plan to provide universal health care coverage in the United States. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also is reaffirming her support for a public-option insurance plan and for expanding Medicare by letting people age 55 year and older opt in."
"President Trump denied a report that said he paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and his first year in office.
The New York Times published a report on Trump's financial information, which he has long kept out of public view, about half an hour before the president held a news conference in the White House on Sunday. The report also comes two days before the first presidential debate against Joe Biden and 37 days ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
Asked to respond to the New York..."
"At least 3 million people have already cast early votes in the Georgia runoff elections, in what has been a 2-month sprint that will likely determine which party gets the majority in the U.S. Senate.
Those numbers were more than half of the record-setting 4.9 million total voters in the state who cast in the general election.
Both Georgia Senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on Tuesday as Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler aim to hold off Democrats Jon Ossoff and..."
"Genius is often defined in myriad ways. One trusted criterion is the ability to do something extraordinary in a field where others could not — and doing something that perhaps will never be done again by anyone else.
By that measure, Rush Limbaugh certainly is the genius of talk radio, a genre in which he not merely excelled but that he also singlehandedly reinvented as something entirely different — and entirely more powerful and instrumental in American life — from what was imaginable pre-Limbaugh.
Even stranger still, his ascendance coincided..."
"U.S. job growth softened in September for the second straight month, but hiring likely remained healthy enough for the Federal Reserve to approve another jumbo interest rate hike when it meets in November.
Employers added 263,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, beating the 250,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, unexpectedly dropped to 3.5%, matching a five-decade low, from 3.7% the previous month. 
Average hourly earnings also continued to rise, climbing 0.3% in September, to $32.46 an hour. "
"Attorneys for President Barack Obama are sending a cease-and-desist letter demanding that South Carolina broadcast stations stop airing a misleading ad from a pro-Donald Trump political action committee that makes it sound like Obama is criticizing his former vice president, Joe Biden.
The ad is part of $250,000 in spending by The Committee to Defend the President. It misuses a snippet from an audio version of Obama’s book “Dreams from My Father” to make it sound as though Obama is criticizing Biden’s support of the black community. He’s actually recalling..."
"At some point the journalistic injunction, “If your mother says she loves you, check it out” became “If it fits the Narrative, don’t bother to check it out.”
Rolling Stone — which really ought to know better by now — just ran the mother of all journalistic corrections when it nuked its own weekend story about how gunshot victims were supposedly going begging at several Oklahoma hospitals because the emergency rooms were being overwhelmed with patients who had overdosed on ivermectin. Rachel Maddow and a lot of other progressive stalwarts tweeted out their own versions of the..."
"On Wednesday, the Washington Post published two articles confirming key details of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Their inquiry into the matter comes just a year and a half after the existence of the laptop and its contents was first reported by the New York Post, and after the authenticity of the emails found on the laptop had been confirmed by most of the paper’s competitors.
The first of the twin Washington Post articles stated that “two experts confirm the veracity of thousands of emails,” while the second explains how the emails shed light on a lucrative deal with CEFC China Energy..."

"Mitt Romney says President Barack Obama's choice of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice as national security adviser is ""a disappointing appointment"" because she misled the American people about what happened in Benghazi, Libya last year.
""I think what she did was to very seriously mislead the American people about what happened in Benghazi. My greatest concern about the Benghazi events was the fact there was not a rescue effort attempted.And that is very troubling to me,"" the 2012 GOP presidential nominee said in an interview with CNN to be broadcast..."
"President Joe Biden's polling continues its downward spiral, matching the lowest approval rating of his administration this week, just seven months before the 2022 midterm elections.
And the White House's inability to stem Biden's bloodletting will have down-ballot implications for Democrats in November, potentially kneecapping the president during the second half of his term.
Only one-third of adults approve of Biden, according to Quinnipiac University. A majority, 54%, of respondents disapproved of him. Another 13% did not have an opinion of the president more than a year after his inauguration.
Senate Republican campaigns spokesman T.W. Arrighi quipped..."

"Biden administration officials treat Russia as an international pariah and push the global community to unite behind Washington’s leadership to compel the Kremlin to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. The administration’s strategy has been just partially successful. Criticisms of Russia’s actions are relatively easy to find among foreign leaders, but when it comes to outright condemnations—much less endorsements of NATO’s position that the war was unprovoked and entirely Moscow’s fault—governments around the world demur.
They are even less inclined to sign on to the U.S.-led campaign to impose extraordinarily severe sanctions on..."
"President Trump on Wednesday morning told supporters that ""we will be back in some form"" after he departed the White House for the final time as president, just hours ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Biden.

As Trump walked to the podium in Joint Base Andrews, he was greeted by a 21-gun salute with..."
"At last. It has taken 49 years and five months, but the Supreme Court has finally reversed the monstrous injustice it worked in 1973. In Roe v. Wade, seven justices cast aside the laws of every state protecting unborn children from the violence of abortion, even though nothing in the text, original understanding, or history of the Constitution authorized them to do so. It was an act of “raw judicial power,” as a Democratic justice wrote in dissent, and even law professors who approved the abortion license Roe created assailed the decision for lacking any constitutional..."
"U.S. employers in June advertised the most monthly job openings in more than 13 years.
Employers posted 4.67 million jobs in June, up 2.1 percent from May's total of 4.58 million, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The number of advertised openings was the highest since February 2001, a positive sign that points to a strengthening economy."

Trump's attorneys are also expected..."
"Pennsylvania's highest court on Saturday night threw out a lower court's order preventing the state from certifying dozens of contests on its Nov. 3 election ballot in the latest lawsuit filed by Republicans challenging the vote count in the battleground state.
The state Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, threw out the three-day-old order, saying the underlying lawsuit was filed months after the law allowed for challenges to Pennsylvania's expansive year-old mail-in voting law."
"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz announced on Monday that he is running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, making him the first major candidate to officially toss his hat in the ring.
While the election is still a long way off, there are several compelling reasons why Cruz should be considered a strong GOP presidential candidate for 2016.
1. He is off to an early start. Cruz is expected to start his campaign immediately rather than launch an exploratory committee as many potential candidates often do.
2. He has strong..."
"President Joe Biden and his onetime boss, former President Barack Obama, appeared at a campaign rally Saturday for Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D-PA) and Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D-PA) in hopes of helping them win their respective Senate and gubernatorial races.
Shapiro leads Republican state Senate leader Doug Mastriano by more than 10 percentage points, but Fetterman is in a very close race against Republican senatorial candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz. Roughly 7,500 people were in attendance, according to the White House.

The motion argues any conviction should be overruled and seeks to forbid any chance of a retrial if Rittenhouse is cleared of the five felonies he faces for the deadly triple shooting at last..."
"The first cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain left a Black Sea port in southern Ukraine on Monday under a deal enabling the safe passage of food-carrying vessels.
The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni departed the port city of Odesa on Monday carrying 26,000 metric tons of corn bound for Lebanon, according to authorities.

"With roughly 12 hours left before the fiscal crisis deadline, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid took to the floor Monday to announce that Senate leaders still had not reached an agreement -- upping the chances that the New Year's Eve ball drop will coincide with massive tax hikes and spending cuts.

Republican senators on Monday were expressing ""optimism"" about the progress of discussions which stretched late..."
"Are We About to Be Urged to Start Wearing Masks?
Saturday, Dr. Matt McCarthy, an assistant professor at the medical school of Cornell University, tweeted, “CDC guidance on masks expected to change in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only.”
But later that day, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responded to his tweet, appearing to shoot down that idea. “CDC does not have updated guidance scheduled to come out on this topic.” They referred..."

One shield read “BLM” in red, while another one had the phrase, “Protect Black Women.”"
"An Arizona-based scientist believes the first known case of COVID-19 was from a vendor at a Wuhan wet market and not an accountant who reported symptoms much later and lived miles away from the market.  
The study by Dr. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, was published Thursday in the journal Science. The new study comes amid swirling questions regarding the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, a topic that has bitterly divided the country for months.
Worobey based his conclusions on public records and reports of early COVID-19 cases..."
"President Joe Biden is set to “forgive” up to $10,000 in federal student debt for those making under $125,000 annually, and $20,000 for Pell grant recipients, transferring the cost of the loans to the American public, the White House announced Wednesday.
Biden’s decision marks the first time a president has canceled federal student-loan debt in such a broad capacity, and comes months before the midterm elections. He had campaigned on canceling up to $10,000 per borrower during the presidential race, but there was no mention of an income cap.

"On Tuesday, President Obama delivered his annual message to the United Nations in New York City.
Among other things, he addressed growing fears of Russian corruption and aggression, the dramatic rise of ISIS, and the importance of Muslim leaders publicly and forcefully rejecting extremism.

“And yet,” he..."
"Pete Buttigieg’s strong finish in Iowa, where he came in less than two points behind Bernie Sanders on the final vote and roughly tied Sanders for state delegates, has propelled him upward in New Hampshire polls. In Suffolk’s tracking poll, Buttigieg trailed Sanders 11 percent to 24 percent in New Hampshire right before Iowa, but he had closed the gap to one point — 23 percent to 24 percent — in that same tracking poll conducted February 5–6.
Did anything happen at Friday’s debate in Manchester to change the dynamic..."
"A former executive at Twitter alleged that the social media company had lackluster cybersecurity safeguards, according to a whistleblower report obtained by CNN and The Washington Post.
Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, the company’s former head of security who reported directly to the CEO, claimed that leadership misled board members and government officials about potential vulnerabilities that left the platform open to hacking, foreign manipulation, and spying.

"The impeachment trial of President Trump drew closer toward its almost-inevitable conclusion with closing arguments Monday, as Democratic House impeachment managers made a last-ditch push to convince the Senate that an acquittal would be a ""death blow"" to the ability to hold a president in check, while Trump’s defense team accused the Democrats of engaging in a rushed, partisan, unjustified endeavor.
Each side is permitted up to two hours to make their final case, as proceedings stretch into another week amid expectations that a largely party-line acquittal awaits the president..."
"President Trump’s executive actions for COVID relief offer little relief but are constitutionally dangerous.
On Saturday, President Trump put his name to four executive actions — three presidential memoranda and one executive order — intended to offer some relief to Americans dealing with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The premise of these actions, made explicit in the text of each, was that Congress had failed to act and now the chief executive has to step in. It is a premise fundamentally at odds with the logic of our..."
"The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit Texas, Florida and other Southeastern states. It was the first decline in nearly seven years.

"Hunter Biden spoke out about his work for foreign companies in a rare interview broadcast on Tuesday.
He said he regrets giving a “hook” to those who wish to hurt his father but denied any wrongdoing.
""I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,"" Biden told ABC News. ""So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way..."
"The U.S. House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol voted unanimously Thursday afternoon to subpoena former President Donald Trump.

"President Joe Biden’s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that Americans might pay more for gas this winter due to upcoming European Union (EU) sanctions on Russian oil.
Yellen told CNN that there was a “risk” of gas prices spiking at the beginning of 2023 because the EU will no longer buy Russian oil at the end of 2022, meaning that global oil prices could rise and also hike gas prices. Yellen added that the Group of Seven wealthy nations (G7) and the EU were working to place a price cap on Russian..."
"France's stringent gun control laws should be blamed for failing to prevent the deadly attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, said real estate tycoon Donald Trump.

"Sen. Chuck Grassley is calling for records related to Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson’s time on the U.S. Sentencing Commission ahead of her Supreme Court confirmation hearing next week, amid Republican claims she was overly lenient to child pornographers -- a charge that the White House is branding a ""debunked"" and ""desperate"" conspiracy theory.
""Judge Jackson’s history of sentencing below guidelines, particularly in cases involving child exploitation, raises legitimate questions about her views on penalties for these crimes,"" Grassley, ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Saturday...."

In one recording, Melania vents her frustration over her attempt to reunite a child separated from their mother at the border.
“I was trying to get the kid reunited..."
"There are honorable and honest ways to oppose your own party, and to leave it. As a conservative who took the Never-Trump path and voted for Evan McMullin in 2016, I will grant the good faith of a lot of lifelong Republicans and conservatives who believe that they must support Donald Trump’s opponent on the grounds that Trump is unfit for office. And people are entitled to change their minds about what they believe. But it is also important to be honest about what you’re doing, and to take responsibility..."
"Disturbing video has emerged of an Iranian girl being beaten by authorities after she removed her hijab amid violent demonstrations that have gripped the country since a young woman died following her arrest for allegedly violating dress rules.

"Claim: Joe Biden said Sunday night that the Trump tax cuts of 2017 and Fed rate cuts of 2019 have left the U.S. unable to afford measures needed to stabilize the American economy during the coronavirus crisis.
“The problem is the policies of this administration. Economically have we eaten a lot of our seed corn here,” Biden said during the Democrat presidential debate. “The ability of us to use leverages that were available before have been used up by this god-awful tax cut of $1.9 trillion and the fact that..."
"Members of Congress are still unpacking the results of the midterm elections, but they will return Monday to Washington with plenty to do, from funding the government to authorizing key defense programs.
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer over the weekend said senators should expect “heavy work” and “long hours” even as the final makeup of next year’s Senate hinges on a December run-off election in Georgia and key House races remain unsettled.
Most notably, Congress must pass a funding bill before Dec. 16 to avoid a government shutdown. Democrats could try to add special provisions to..."
"President Trump confirmed Sunday that he spoke about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in a midsummer call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but said he did nothing wrong, as Democrats warned these latest charges may have “crossed the Rubicon” and into impeachment territory.
Leaving the White House on Sunday, Mr. Trump insisted the conversation that has consumed Washington for several days was “largely congratulatory.”
But, he added, “it was largely corruption — all of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don’t want our people,..."

The comedian asked her, “How many times when you were secretary of state..."
"As I mentioned he would be earlier this week, President Obama dedicated his Friday morning to educating the youths he used as backdrops at the White House about why it is that the GOPs idea to fix this cyclical federal student-loan battle by tying interest rates to the market, instead of the presidents own plan allowing politicians to continue to arbitrarily determine the interest rates that they deem appropriate, is such a very terrible take on the problem."
"Last week, we said something on television that the usual chorus of hyperaggressive liars is now pretending was somehow highly controversial. Ordinarily, we'd ignore all of this. Once you've been denounced as a White supremacist for quoting Martin Luther King Jr., you realize such criticism is all just all another form of social control. Honestly, who cares what they think?
But in this one case, we thought it might be worth pausing to restate the original point, both because it was true and worth saying, and also because America badly..."
"Paul Manafort's state charges in New York were thrown out by a judge on Wednesday in a dramatic court victory for the former Trump campaign chairman.
He won a claim that the prosecution brought by Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance, was invalidated by 'double jeopardy' laws because it overlapped with the federal crimes of which he was convicted earlier this year.
However Manafort remains in federal custody and is not scheduled for release until Christmas Day 2024.
But the judge's ruling opens the way for Donald Trump to set..."
"Matt Walsh’s hilarious yet hard-hitting documentary, What Is a Woman?, addresses an issue that is at the center of the culture war: transgenderism. Throughout the film, which premiered on June 1 exclusively for Daily Wire subscribers, Walsh struggles to find anyone who can answer what would appear to be a simple question. But given that incoming Supreme Court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dodged the same question during her confirmation hearings, claiming she was unable to answer it because she was “not a biologist,” it appears the question is indeed a complicated one.
“I first..."
"For years, society has debated the proper role of a woman. Should she vote? Should she own property? Should she be considered a citizen in her own right or merely an extension of her husband? Should she pursue a career or stay at home instead?
On the one hand, there were — and still are — those who wanted to shove women in a box and limit their influence to the confines of the home. And on the other, there were many who, in pursuit of equality, drove women to..."

"Republican primaries, which were once a sparring ground for ideas, have too often of late become battles over attitude and tests of personal loyalty to Donald Trump. Some candidates seek to prove their bona fides by embracing false claims about the 2020 election being stolen, precisely because they know that responsible opponents will be unwilling to do so. Too many campaigns revolve around the idea that candidates should be not just unyielding or combative but transgressive. When voters reward this behavior, it is imitated further.
Just as cynically, Democrats — while..."
"When you think about D-Day on this 75th anniversary, there is much that stimulates a kind of awe. Strictly as a military problem the thing was one possible FUBAR (ask a Vet) piled upon another. At the big levels, strategic and operational, it was daunting, to put it mildly.
There was, in the first place, the enemy. In the 20th century, the Germans had built an awesome military reputation. They had fought the whole world, twice, and come very close to victory in 1914 and, again, in 1941.

"The White House narrowed its strategy Sunday on convincing Capitol Hill that the United States should launch a military strike on Syria, asking why wouldn’t lawmakers agree to punish the use of nerve gas on children and others when the evidence is indisputable and suggesting such a move is as much about sending a message to Iran as it is about punishing the Syrian government.
“Not a person is refuting the evidence,” White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told “Fox News Sunday.” “The question now before Congress is..."

Before confirming Biden’s win, objections to his victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania were brought up — and subsequently squashed — during the joint-session of Congress.
Other planned objections were dropped by several Republican Senators after Wednesday’s unrest."
"The federal budget deficit for the 2019 fiscal year stands $984 billion, up 26 percent from the $779 billion deficit recorded at the end of 2018, the Treasury Department announced on Friday.
The deficit has exploded over the past year despite substantial economic growth. GOP tax cuts in 2017, combined with increased discretionary spending and a failure to rein in entitlement programs, have contributed to the increase.
The deficit stood at $665 billion in 2017 prior to the passage of tax cuts that are projected to increase the deficit by..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Friday that he was not looking to ""destroy"" Ukraine and saw no need to deploy massive strikes there in the near future — only to launch four ""kamikaze drones"" into Kyiv Monday morning.
The Russian leader made the Friday comments at a rare press conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, after taking part in a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a regional intergovernmental organization made up of former Soviet nations. The summit and Putin's 30-minute briefing occurred days after Russia had unleashed a series of missile strikes on civilian areas of major..."
"Labor Day festivities in a central New Jersey borough were called off Monday morning after explosive devices were found near the parade route just hours before the governor and first lady were set to arrive.
Thomas Kaiser, 55, was arrested in connection with “destructive devices” found at his South Plainfield property, close to the start of the 62nd Annual Labor Day Parade, which was canceled as a result, the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement.
Officials found a half dozen of the explosive devices, a police source said."
"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was charged Thursday with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for aiding Chelsea Manning in the cracking of a password to a classified U.S. government computer in 2010, the U.S. Justice Department announced hours after Assange's arrest in London.
Assange is accused of engaging in a conspiracy with Manning, the former U.S. Army officer, in breaking a password stored on a U.S. Defense Department computer connected to a U.S. government computer network for classified documents and communications, the Justice Department said. Manning later transmitted a trove of..."
"The New York Times really needs to get its complaint straight. Apparently, President Trump is a no-good businessman who never makes any money, and so he aggressively avoids tax payments, paying just $750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017 (if the report is true, which Trump has unsurprisingly called ""fake news""). No doubt, he has to be aggressive to ensure he doesn't pay taxes on money he hasn't made. Or maybe it's all just another reason to stand in Midtown Manhattan shrieking about Trump.
Because there's nothing in Trump's..."
"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Monday that the men who wrote the Constitution intended for the president’s nominees to be subject to only a majority vote, and said filibusters of nominees were never envisioned.
The Senate’s leading Democrat, who led repeated filibusters of President George W. Bush’s nominations when Republicans held the majority, said he’s changed his mind since then, and he accused the GOP of forcing his hand by slow-walking so many of President Obama’s nominees."
"The Senate on Saturday voted 57-43 to acquit former President Donald Trump for “incitement of an insurrection” after the House last month passed a single article of impeachment against him for his role in encouraging his supporters to amass at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.
Seven GOP senators joined Democrats in voting to convict the former president: Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania."
"A New York woman who said she was sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein at the age of 14 sued the disgraced financier's estate and a former associate on Wednesday, in the start of an expected wave of lawsuits.
Jennifer Araoz, 32, said in her complaint that she was starting out in high school when an Epstein associate brought her to the financier's massive mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, beginning a grooming process that led to months of sexual abuse, including what she called a ""brutal rape.""
The lawsuit in..."
"Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican former Sen. David Perdue in a bitterly contentious Senate race in Georgia, a win that along with Rev. Raphael Warnock's defeat of GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler secures the Democrats' control in the upper chamber of Congress, Fox News projected Wednesday.
Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, won a runoff election against Perdue, the one-term senator and former Fortune 500 CEO, who at 71 is more than twice Ossoff's age. The November Election Day result failed to give either candidate a majority, forcing Tuesday's rematch.
Ossoff claimed..."
"The Brennan Center for Justice, which is heavily financed by George Soros, is calling for Democrats to spend $250 million to educate voters about any changes that will allow vote-by-mail in the upcoming presidential election, advocating an advertising campaign about those changes in non-English languages."
"Last night President Obama made a rare appearance on the campaign trail to stump for Wisconsin Democrat Mary Burke, who is challenging Governor Scott Walker. During Obama's speech, in particular the moment when he encouraged people to vote and to knock on doors for Burke, people were caught on video filing out of the room."
"Inflation has peaked. The Fed’s tightening has accomplished its mission. Strong labor market and consumer fundamentals will keep any recession mild.
These are among the story lines providing a tailwind to stocks in recent weeks. They feed hopes the Federal Reserve has achieved a soft landing: bringing inflation down to 2% without pushing up unemployment or tipping the economy into recession.
A reality check is in order. A soft landing is certainly possible, but these story lines look more like wishful thinking than a tough-minded appraisal of the Fed’s task. Let’s review."
"Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor and up-and-coming member of the House GOP, will lead the new select investigative inquiry into the Benghazi attack, Speaker John A. Boehner said Monday.
Mr. Gowdy, 49, is in just his second term, but he has already gained a reputation as a relentless investigator. He was the lawmaker who pushed to declare that former IRS employee Lois G. Lerner had waived her right against self-incrimination during her appearance before the House Over"
"The tech industry is laying off workers at an alarming pace as it braces for a potential recession triggered by painfully high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates.
Despite still-solid job growth and record-high wages in many industries, big tech is battening down the hatches as it warns of an increasingly grim economic outlook.
Amazon, Apple, Meta, Lyft and Twitter are among the companies either implementing hiring freezes or letting workers go as the Federal Reserve moves to raise interest rates at the fastest pace in decades in order to combat inflation. Economists widely..."
"Former FDA Associate Commissioner Peter Pitts said Thursday that while formula manufacturer Abbott is responsible for nationwide shortages by failing to safely maintain their factory, the FDA can have better protocols to handle major production shutdowns.
""That plant needed to be shut down,"" Pitts said on ""Fox & Friends."" ""The FDA has been 24-7 on-site since February with Abbott to get this plant back online."""
"The man killed after Portland protesters clashed with Trump supporters was a backer of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, it was reported Sunday.
Joey Gibson, head of the Washington state group, also described the dead man as a “good friend,” the Associated Press reported.
An AP freelance photographer who was in the area where the shooting took place Saturday night said the man who was shot was wearing a Patriot Prayer hat.
The group has clashed with Portland Black Lives Matters protesters in the past."
"A State Department foreign service officer will tell House impeachment investigators Wednesday former national security adviser John Bolton cautioned him that Rudy Giuliani ""was a key voice with the president on Ukraine,"" which could complicate U.S. goals in the Eastern European country.
The testimony from Christopher Anderson makes clear that administration officials were concerned about Giuliani's back-channel involvement in Ukraine policy, and his push for investigations of Democrats, even before the July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and his Ukraine counterpart at the center of the House impeachment..."
"Kamala Harris was not happy about being publicly associated with the Mexican border, and after her disastrous interview with NBC’s Lester Holt and her flailing trip to Mexico and Guatemala, we can see why she would be generally leery of public-facing responsibilities. The entire excursion was a fiasco in just about every possible way, even down to her plane having to turn around and return to Andrews Air Force Base half an hour into its flight. Harris may be comfortable as a partisan attack dog and a historic symbol, but everyone involved will..."
"The economy added 1.4 million jobs in August and new jobless claims fell below one million last week as the U.S. labor market hints at a gradual recovery from the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
A total of 881,000 initial unemployment claims were filed during the week ending August 29, the Labor Department said Thursday, beating economists’ projections of 950,000 new claims.
Last week marks a decrease of 130,000 new claims from the prior week’s 1.011 million initial claims. Continuing claims also fell dramatically by 1.24 million, sinking..."
"California officials started to distribute financial assistance on May 18 for illegal immigrants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Each individual can receive $500 in direct assistance, if they qualify, with a maximum of $1,000 in assistance per household. A household is defined as persons who live and purchase and prepare meals together.
To qualify, people must provide proof that they are illegal immigrants. They must also show they’re not eligible for federal COVID-19-related assistance and have experienced hardship as a result of the pandemic, according to the state’s Department of..."
"Seizing on one of the biggest shopping days of the year, the White House tried to exert pressure on Republican lawmakers Monday by warning that consumer spending could drop by nearly $200 billion in 2013 if Congress fails to approve an extension of tax cuts for the middle class by the end of next month."
"Today’s woke perspective condemns Columbus Day as an unworthy holiday. However, a circumspect understanding of history offers numerous reasons why Columbus should not only be celebrated, but also why his qualities of character make him an exemplary figure worthy of emulation for all time.
First, it’s ironic that criticism of Columbus Day emanates from the left in America for Columbus never set foot on or even saw any territory that later became part of the continental United States. Columbus’ four expeditions to the New World between 1492 and 1504 were..."
"Let the redistricting scramble begin.
The Census Bureau on Thursday will release the data used to draw voting districts, setting up a scramble of map-drawing and litigation ahead of the 2022 midterm elections that could influence the balance of power in the House.
The release of the detailed once-per-decade data was delayed due in part to the coronavirus pandemic, squeezing the timeline for legislatures and state commissions to draw and finalize the lines and maps before primary elections begin.
Some states will see bigger changes in their maps than others...."
"NATO leaders are set to approve major increases in the number of forces stationed in Eastern Europe during an upcoming emergency summit, according to NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who indicated four new battle groups would likely be placed in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.
“I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains, with major increases in the eastern part of the alliance on land, in the air and at sea,” Stoltenberg said during a press conference before the summit."
"A peaceful protest Saturday in support of an eastern Oregon ranching family facing jail time for arson was followed shortly afterward by an occupation of a building at a national wildlife refuge.
Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a standoff with the government over grazing rights, told The Oregonian that he and two of his brothers were among a group of dozens of people occupying the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge."
"Former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party remained in Herschel Walker’s corner Tuesday following a report that alleged the pro-life Senate hopeful from Georgia paid for an ex-girlfriend to get an abortion 13 years ago. 
Trump said Walker, whom he encouraged to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has been “slandered and maligned by the Fake News Media and obviously, the Democrats.”
“Interestingly, I’ve heard many horrible things about his opponent, Raphael Warnock, things that nobody should be talking about, so we don’t. Herschel has properly denied the charges against him,..."
"The news is out. “The Interview” will not be coming to a Cineplex near you on Christmas Day. Sony, the studio that produced Seth Rogen’s $44 million comedy about the assassination North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has dropped it.
Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal originally greenlighted this film. But as of today, she and her corporate bosses are the bitches of North Korea’s Dear Leader--the only guy in Hollywood with the power to red light a holiday blockbuster.
Kim didn’t even have to come to Hollywood to kill the film. An..."
"The great American jobs creation machine is firing on all cylinders, with February’s jobs figures showing far more strength than expected and both January and December being raised higher than previously reported.
The U.S. economy added 273,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent, the government said Friday.
Economists had forecast 175,000 nonfarm payroll growth and the unemployment rate to tick down slightly to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent the prior month.
Average hourly earnings were up by 3 percent compared with a year ago...."
"Two months into full Republican control of Congress, GOP leaders are struggling to demonstrate they really are in charge.
The stunning House defeat Friday of a three-week spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security exposed Speaker John Boehner's weakness in the face of rebellious conservatives.
It also again demonstrated his need to rely on Democrats at critical moments as the minority party's agreement to a one-week spending bill helped the speaker get it over the finish line with only hours to spare before a threatened agency shutdown."
"The U.S. economy lost 701,000 jobs in March, snapping a decade-long record of employment growth, as strict measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic shuttered businesses and forced Americans to stay at home.
It was the first decline in payrolls since September 2010, and the steepest since March 2009, in the midst of the Great Recession.
The unemployment rate jumped to 4.4 percent, up from a half-century low of 3.5 percent in February.
Economists surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast a payroll decline of 100,000 and the unemployment rate to rise to..."
"Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Wednesday that the state will carry out a manual hand recount of ballots cast during the Nov. 3 election in the midst of allegations of voter fraud, mismanagement, and irregularities.
“This will help build confidence. It will be an audit, a recount, and a recanvas all at once,” Raffensperger, a Republican, stated at a press conference. “It will be a heavy lift.”"
"General Motors and the United Auto Workers on Wednesday reached a tentative settlement to end a strike that has dragged on for 31 days.
The auto company and the union have reached an agreement in principal, and will send the agreement to the UAW’s national council to vote tomorrow, representatives from GM and the UAW confirmed in separate statements.
The strike hasn’t ended yet, and union members could still reject the proposal, according to an announcement by the union."
"The global spread of the coronavirus has forced the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed until next summer at the latest, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Tuesday.
Abe said that he and the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach came to an agreement to postpone the Games. The latest the event can take place is the summer of 2021.
""In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today, the IOC President and the Prime Minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII..."
"Does the Constitution require Americans to accept Big Tech censorship? The claim is counterintuitive but the logic is clear: If you submit a letter to this newspaper, the editors have no legal obligation to publish it, and a statute requiring them to do so would be struck down as a violation of the Journal’s First Amendment rights. Facebook and Twitter, the argument goes, have the same right not to provide a platform to views they find objectionable.
Big Tech censorship has provoked interest in new civil-rights statutes—state laws that would bar the companies from..."
"In at least one big and bruising culture-war battle, the Mormon church wants to call a partial truce.
Convening a rare press conference on Tuesday at church headquarters in Salt Lake City, Mormon leaders pledged to support anti-discrimination laws for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people, as long the laws also protect the rights of religious groups.
In exchange, the Mormon church wants gay rights advocates — and the government — to back off.
“When religious people are publicly intimidated, retaliated against, forced from employment or made to suffer personal..."
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal popularity has slipped over the past couple years, but she still has a higher favorable rating then a half dozen of her potential GOP rivals for president in 2016, a Washington Post/ABC News poll said.
The survey found that 49 percent of respondents view Mrs. Clinton in a positive light — down from 67 percent more than two years ago — and 46 percent view her unfavorably, as she lays the ground work for a presidential bid.
“Yet Clinton still is better off..."
"The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Monday indictments for six Russian military hackers who were part of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).
“No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly causing unprecedented collateral damage to pursue small tactical advantages and to satisfy fits of spite,”Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said Monday. The six hackers began their work in 2015, according to the DOJ. The hackers “engaged in computer intrusions and attacks” to undermine, retaliate against and destabilize foreign nations..."
"KYIV, Ukraine – When I first arrived in Ukraine on January 23, the skies were gray and the weather cold. In the depths of winter, it snows in Kyiv almost every day and the sidewalks are treacherously icy. At the small coffee kiosk, little more than a hole in the wall, a young barista whipped up hot lattes and said she wasn’t worried about the prospect of war.  She was far from alone.  
Despite tens of thousands of Russian troops and artillery gathering at the border for what Moscow called military exercises,..."
"Facebook's Oversight Board decided Wednesday morning to uphold the site's ban of former President Donald Trump's account -- but the Board also ordered a new review of the ""indefinite suspension"" to take place within six months, leaving the door open slightly for a future Trump reinstatement.
The determination by the Board also applies to social app Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.
""The Board has upheld Facebook's decision on January 7, 2021, to restrict then-President Donald Trump's access to posting content on his Facebook page and Instagram account,"" the Board..."
"Daily COVID-19 cases across the United States have dropped 47 percent in the last week — offering a glimmer of hope that the Omicron winter surge is finally starting to ease.
There were about 717,800 new cases reported in the US on Monday, statistics compiled by John Hopkins University shows.
The average infection count has been sitting at about 800,000 per day over the past week.
It is a sharp drop from the record 1.4 million new cases reported just one week earlier on Jan. 10, according to the data...."
"Texas’s and Ohio’s Supreme Courts have given the go-ahead for the states to enforce their respective state laws that ban abortion, blocking efforts that barred the laws from taking effect, coming after the U.S. Supreme Court last week overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.
Roe v. Wade had enabled abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy across the country for almost five decades. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24 sends regulation of the procedure back to states.
The Texas Supreme Court on Friday allowed (pdf) the state’s longstanding pre-Roe abortion ban to..."
"Published July 16, 2021: There’s no doubt that vaccination rates have hit a wall of skepticism: 48.5 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, and 56.1 percent have had at least one dose of the vaccine. This is consistent with opinion surveys earlier this year showing roughly 40 percent of the public as wary or skeptical about the vaccines. A wave of outreach has begun to get vaccination rates up further, especially in light of the spread of the Delta variant. Some states have tried lotteries, in which people who get vaccinated are entered..."
"The number of new applications for unemployment benefits dipped to 881,000 last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday in an encouraging sign for the economy.
Forecasters had projected 950,000 new jobless claims.
Instead, claims fell to the lowest level since mid-March, before the pandemic induced mass layoffs.
The drop hints at a slowdown in layoffs, which would be good news for the reeling labor market. But it also could be an artifact of changes the Labor Department made to its calculation of jobless claims. The agency employed a new methodology..."
"There are areas where gun control activists and the pro-Second Amendment camp can meet. There are gun violence protective orders; keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill. But we’ll never get there. It’s all a trap. Even bills that strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) are a dangerous game because if you give the Left an inch, they’ll take a mile. They admitted it yesterday. Deleney Tarr, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student, gave an impassioned speech about how..."
"The economy added 379,000 jobs in February and unemployment ticked down to 6.2%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, as the pandemic receded and commerce revived faster than projected.
Forecasters had anticipated fewer than 200,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs.
“In the coming weeks and months, as weather improves across the country, businesses welcome back more customers, and more vaccinations are administered, we should see a more substantial pick-up in hiring,” said Bankrate.com's senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick."
"Asked whether men can give birth, most people wouldn’t respond the way the transgenderism-obsessed Left would prefer. Understanding this, the Left is trying to hector, bully, and censor its way toward establishing a ridiculous new conception of gender as a matter of personal choosing rather than biological fact. That project requires changing the language, ignoring science, and discarding common human experience. Now, it appears to require policing comedy, too.
For espousing the common-sense view in his new Netflix special The Closer, however, comedian Dave Chappelle is being attacked as a “transphobe” by..."
"On one end are Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. On the other are Sens. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and the Tea Party contingent.
The stand-off between these factions has driven the partial government shutdown, which as of Friday afternoon was still not resolved. But there's plenty of middle ground between them.
So, can lawmakers find it?"
"The Dow plummeted 6.9 percent on Thursday in its sharpest one-day decline since the start of the coronavirus as investors face the prospect of a slow perhaps painful recovery.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,861.82 points, to close at 25,128.17, while S&P 500 slid 5.9 percent, to 3,002.10. Even the Nasdaq Composite index of tech stocks, which has been less affected by the pandemic, dropped 5.3 percent, to end the day at 9,492.73."
"Germany is going to ""reassess"" the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in response to Russia's actions toward Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday.
The 764-mile pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany has not begun operating. Nord Stream 2 is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia state company Gazprom.
Earlier this month, President Biden promised to ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. Scholz, appearing with Biden on his first official visit to Washington, was far less explicit about stopping Nord..."
"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said in a statement Friday that impeaching President Donald Trump 12 days before he leaves office would only further divide America.
House Democrats have called for articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to remove the 45th president from office after riots at the Capitol building erupted this week.
McCarthy condemned the violence that erupted on January 6. However, he said that movements to remove Trump from office before January 20 would only further harm the country."
"The Senate has finally reached an agreement to clear the long-stalled anti-human trafficking bill after settling on new language to restrict public money going to pay for abortions, the chamber’s top Democrat announced Tuesday — and it sets up a quick vote soon on attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch."
"The moderators of the GOP debate Thursday night at the Quicken Loans arena gave Donald Trump plenty of rope – and sure enough he hanged himself. Right out of the box, the candidates were asked to pledge their support to whomever ultimately wins the GOP nomination; the only hold-out was Trump, who refused to make that commitment and who elicited boos from the audience."
"Tensions between Democratic Party loyalists and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are reaching a boiling point as the democratic socialist cemented his front-runner status for the party's 2020 presidential nomination.
Ahead of his decisive victory in the Nevada caucuses, Sanders tweeted out a message that has been a central theme in his campaign: ""I've got news for the Republican establishment. I've got news for the Democratic establishment. They can't stop us.""
Such a message, though pivotal to his campaign and adorned by his supporters, sparked anger among traditional Democrats across media..."
"Senate Democrats successfully filibustered a bill to crack down on human trafficking Tuesday, setting up a standoff between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Harry Reid over the president’s attorney general nominee.
The final vote was 56-42; 60 votes were needed to invoke cloture and end the Democratic filibuster. Four Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin (WV), Joe Donnelly (IN), Heidi Heitkamp (ND) and Bob Casey (PA) voted to move forward.
McConnell has vowed to only allow a vote on Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s nominee, after the Senate finishes consideration..."
"The United States said Friday it will create a position of Arctic ambassador to step up diplomacy as Russia and China increase their presence in waters opened up by climate change.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken will soon name an ambassador-at-large who will engage with other Arctic nations, indigenous groups and other stakeholders, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said.
“An Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous and cooperative is of critical strategic importance to the United States and a priority for Secretary Blinken,” Patel said.
Warming has been rising..."
"As fires rage in the Amazon rainforest, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration rejected $20 million in aid from the G-7 that was pledged to fight them.
Bolsonaro’s chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, suggested that the funds be used elsewhere.
“We are thankful, but maybe those resources would be more relevant to reforest Europe,” the 64-year-old Lorenzoni is quoted as saying."
"President Biden on Wednesday defended his record during his first year in office, saying he ""didn’t overpromise,"" but instead ""outperformed,"" maintaining the ""enormous progress"" his administration has made and vowed to ""stay on track"" going forward.
During his first press conference in months—his tenth since taking office—the president was asked whether he overpromised on what he could achieve during his first year at the White House, as the country grapples with rising inflation, a surge in the highly-transmissible omicron variant of COVID-19, and as his legislative agenda is stalled in Congress."
"The National Football League has been getting kicked in the teeth lately. It’s entirely their fault. The league and its players decided to go to war with Trump and suffered a humiliating defeat. The president didn’t start this conflict. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick did when he decided to sit and then take a knee during the national anthem last year. In September, Trump said that these players should be punished for taking a knee during the anthem. Everyone went nuts. The league thought the fans were on..."
"President Donald Trump said Monday the U.S. government should get a ""substantial portion"" of the sales price of the U.S. operations of popular short-video app TikTok and warned he will ban the service in the United States on Sept. 15 without a sale.
The turnaround came after Trump on Friday said he was planning to ban the Chinese-owned video app's U.S. operations as soon as Saturday after dismissing a possible sale to Microsoft.
Reuters reported last week that some investors are valuing TikTok at about $50 billion, citing people familiar..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday announced the seven lawmakers who will serve as the House managers to prosecute the case against President Trump in his Senate impeachment trial, which is expected to begin in earnest next week.
The House managers include House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who will be the lead manager and who led much of the impeachment inquiry out of his committee with dramatic hearings to develop the case against the president and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose panel drafted the articles..."
"The U.S. economy grew less than expected in the three months through June as supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages slowed the pace of economic activity while the country reopened from its COVID-19 lockdowns. 
Gross domestic product – the broadest measure of economic performance – grew at a 6.5% annual rate during the second quarter, according to an advance estimate released Thursday by the Commerce Department. Analysts surveyed by Refintiv were expecting 8.5% growth. First-quarter GDP was revised down to 6.3% from its previous reading of 6.4%.
The above-trend growth in the second quarter reflected..."
"Heading into their nominating conventions, President Obama and Mitt Romney are dead even Ã¢â‚¬â€ down to a tenth of a percent Ã¢â‚¬â€ in the latest The Washington Times/JZ Analytics Poll, which also shows independents, the critical swing group, beginning to pick sides.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney both stood at 45.7 percent support, and Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson garnered nearly 4 percent support. About 5 percent said they were undecided in an election looking like it will depend on which candidate can turn out his base supporters.

"The Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before President Trump pressured the country's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
The reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to Trump's Ukraine..."
"Viral video platform TikTok’s withdrawal from Hong Kong is a savvy commercial move that sidesteps thorny privacy issues but it will not shield the app completely from accusations of collusion with China, experts say.
As Facebook, Twitter and other US tech giants risk angering China by refusing to share Hong Kong user data, Chinese-owned TikTok has also portrayed an image of principle by pulling out of the territory."
"President Barack Obama is asking Congress for $300 billion to update the nation's roads and railways.
Obama plans to make the proposal Wednesday at the Union Depot rail and bus station in St. Paul, Minn.
The Highway Trust Fund finances federal highway and transit programs but is forecast to go broke as early as August."
"The White House has revealed the lawmakers it has invited to meet with President Biden and Vice President Harris Monday on their $2 trillion infrastructure package.
Biden and Harris will sit down with Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Maria Cantwell (D-Wa.), as well as Reps. Don Young (R-Ak.), Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ), David Price (D-NC) and Garret Graves (R-La.), the White House said Sunday.

"Mayor of Windsor, Ontario, Drew Dilkens, said in a press conference Thursday that Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer offered to help remove protestors blocking the Ambassador Bridge for the past several days.
The bridge is a key border between the U.S. and Canada currently occupied by convoy truckers in protest of Canada’s COVID-19 mandates. The protest, called the Freedom Convoy, began in Ottawa and has since gone international.
“The State of Michigan and the governors’ office directly have offered to send over heavy equipment to help remove vehicles, to provide security, they’ve offered to..."
"Iran and the United States and its negotiating partners finally reached agreement Tuesday on a deal that would curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief -- setting up a looming showdown between President Obama and Congress, where lawmakers could take issue with several provisions, including one giving Iran leverage over inspections."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the coronavirus can ""sometimes"" be spread through the air, especially inside places that have poor ventilation, The Washington Post reports.
This isn’t the first time the CDC has stated the virus can be spread through airborne transmission. Last month, the agency posted an update to its website about how the virus can spread and it mentioned airborne transmission. That update was removed after the CDC stated it was posted in error and had not gone through proper review channels.

"Governor Christie's office has provided the following statement to Townhall (emphasis mine), and spokesman Colin Reed reaffirmed the governor's categorical denial of Mayor Zimmer's allegations in a subsequent phone call:

"Boy, do I have a story to tell you about the presidential vote, so perk up. Here we go.
I thought Mitt Romney was a good choice to run against President Obama because of his economic experience. Also the Governor is a free market capitalist and offered a stark contrast to the President who wants the federal government to drive the economy.
The campaign unfolded slowly as most Americans did not know Romney. And with all the high tech gizmos these days, it's difficult to get the attention..."

The logjam comes one week after DOH started quietly increasing testing for nursing home residents, and following Gov. Cuomo’s announcement Sunday of a new executive order mandating that state-licensed nursing homes..."
"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed suit on Tuesday against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, claiming the four states exploited the pandemic to justify ignoring election laws.
In papers filed with the U.S. Supreme Court, Paxton claimed the states unlawfully enacted last-minute changes, which skewed the results of the general election.
The papers also allege that the majority of the rushed decisions, made by local officials, were not approved by the state legislatures, thereby circumventing the Constitution.
“The battleground states flooded their people with unlawful ballot applications and ballots while..."
"The White House tried to salvage President Obama’s free-trade deal on Capitol Hill Wednesday, even as House Democrats intensified their opposition to the measure and blamed Mr. Obama for mishandling the politics of his top second-term priority.
A day after Senate Democrats dealt an embarrassing setback to Mr. Obama on the trade legislation, key Democratic lawmakers vowed that the task ahead for the president will only become more difficult if the measure eventually reaches the House."
"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has defeated incumbent President Donald Trump, denying him a second term in the White House, Fox News projects, a victory for the former vice president after a bitter campaign and dramatic, prolonged vote count in battleground states sparking lawsuits from the Trump campaign."
"President Biden hopes the political fallout from his botched Afghanistan withdrawal will fade quickly, but Tuesday’s Senate hearing with the secretary of Defense and two top generals doesn’t cast his decisions in a better light.
The hearing underscored that the President acted against the advice of the military in yanking the residual U.S. force from the country. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Gen. Kenneth McKenzie both made clear in their testimony that they recommended that about 2,500 U.S. troops stay in Afghanistan to delay..."
"The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point Wednesday, in a strong, but expected move to slow surging inflation even as economic growth went negative in the first quarter.
The central bank is expected to continue raising the rate through the end of the year after holding it at or near zero for several years. It normally raises or lowers the rate in quarter-point increments, and the half-point increase, which followed a quarter-point boost in March, was the biggest jump since May, 2000. The current federal funds target rate is between..."
"Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas is indisputably good at one part of his job: always referring to the migrant surge at the border as a “challenge,” never a “crisis.”
He visited Del Rio, Texas, recently and refused to use the offending word about more than 10,000 Haitian migrants huddled under a bridge, living among trash with insufficient food and water in sweltering heat. A mere “challenge.”
If euphemism and spin constituted competent, Team Biden wouldn’t be coping with a historic surge of illegal crossings at the border that reached another level with..."
"U.S. military department heads were ordered Tuesday to “immediately” start getting their troops vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19, two days after the first COVID-19 vaccine received federal approval.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a memorandum made public Aug. 25 that the secretaries of all military departments must “immediately begin full vaccination” of all service members who aren’t already vaccinated.
A timeline was not laid out in the memo, but Austin directed a rapid pace, telling the secretaries to “impose ambitious timelines for implementation.”
Austin announced on Aug. 9 that all active-duty..."
"President Obama said early Thursday that he wants to make a major push to have Congress pass immigration legislation this year — but by late in the day the White House was confirming he will nominate someone with little immigration experience to head the Department of Homeland Security.
Administration and congressional officials said Mr. Obama will turn to Jeh Johnson, who was the top lawyer at the Pentagon, to run the agency that oversees the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and all three..."
"A U.S. court has issued a warrant for the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker at the center of a fierce international dispute, the Justice Department said late Friday.
The oil tanker, Grace 1, with more than 2 million barrels of oil aboard and $995,000 are subject to forfeiture based on a complaint by the U.S. Government."
"A bizarre report about Republican congressmen on a late-night swim last year in the Sea of Galilee -- including one who went skinny-dipping -- triggered a flurry of clarifications from Capitol Hill overnight and a round of accusations between two primary opponents.
The report in Politico said the FBI had looked into the incident in Israel last year, when a mix of GOP congressional freshmen and leaders were visiting as guests of The American Israel Educational Foundation.
According to the report, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder stripped naked and..."
"The Trump campaign announced that it will ""immediately"" request a recount in Wisconsin, a crucial state for Republicans where Democratic nominee Joe Biden currently holds a razor-thin lead.
""The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so,"" campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a Wednesday statement.
Biden leads Trump in the state by about 20,000 votes—0.7 percent of 3.2 million ballots cast—according to the New York Times. Under Wisconsin law, a campaign must be within 1 percent to request a recount, which..."
"To the extent that Democrats are still banking on Latino voters to carry them to durable national majorities, the result in Tuesday’s special election in the Texas 34th congressional district should be an alarm bell. Joe Biden carried TX-34 by four points in 2020; Filemon Vela, the incumbent Democratic congressman, won it by 13.6. But Vela resigned to work for a lobbying firm in March, triggering a special election to finish out his term — and this time, voters in the South Texas district opted for the Republican candidate by more than seven and..."
"Pharmaceutical giant Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced Monday that it has asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency approval of its COVID-19 pill after the experimental drug showed “compelling results” in clinical trials.
The pill, called molnupiravir, cut the risk of hospitalization or death in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 by about 50 percent in a late-stage trial, according to data from a phase three clinical trial shared earlier this month.
“The extraordinary impact of this pandemic demands that we move with unprecedented urgency, and that is what our..."
"The number of daily new COVID-19 infections has shot up almost 50 percent in the United States amid the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant — with rises even recorded in states with high vaccination rates, data shows.
The US on Tuesday recorded an average of 19,455 new cases per day over the last seven days — up 47.5 percent from the previous week, according to a USA Today analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.
But deaths from the pandemic have continued to dip nationwide, down about 25 percent — to an average..."
"Senate Democrats voted Thursday to block a $250 billion infusion of cash into small businesses suffering amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Democratic caucus denied unanimous consent to a bill floated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) that would have added the funds. Democrats then offered their own bill, which would have included not just $250 billion for small businesses but an additional $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments—Republicans likewise objected.
The dispute comes as new data show unemployment claims surged by 6.6 million over the..."
"Billionaire Tom Steyer—whose name recognition of late centers around his campaign to impeach President Donald Trump—officially entered the presidential race on Tuesday, vowing to confront corporations and lessen their sway over the political system.
""I think people believe that the corporations have bought the democracy. That the politicians don't care about them or respect them,"" he said in a video announcement. ""Really what we're trying to do is make democracy work by pushing power down to the people.""
Although Steyer has not yet outlined a policy platform, he has been..."
"The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-0 to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court despite the Democratic members of the panel boycotting the hearing.
The nomination will now move to a full Senate vote on Monday.
Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday said he will not allow Democrats to “take over” the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation vote for Barrett after they made good on their threat to boycott the hearing.
“We’re not going to allow them to take over the committee,” Graham said in his opening statement. “They made..."
"Russia has deployed up to 20,000 mercenaries as part of its new offensive in Ukraine's Donbas region, it was reported on Tuesday.
The mercenaries, from Syria, Libya, and elsewhere, were sent to fight with no heavy equipment or armored vehicles, a European official said.
The soldiers were recruited by the Wagner Group, a Russian-backed private military company, the Guardian reported.
""What I can tell you is that we did see some transfer from these areas, Syria and Libya, to the eastern Donbas region, and these guys are mainly used as a mass..."
"GOP lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee are casting doubt on a White House whistleblower in a Monday morning memorandum, alleging that nearly two dozen White House aides were given security clearances despite initially being denied.
Democratic staff revealed Monday morning that the whistleblower noted that 25 people, including senior White House aides, were given clearance despite having it rejected by career staffers. The whistleblower, Tricia Newbold, is a manager in the White House personnel office."
"Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin was narrowly ahead Tuesday evening in the closely contested governor's race in Kentucky, where President Trump has called for an ""angry majority"" of GOP voters -- a nod to Richard Nixon's “silent majority"" and Ronald Reagan's “moral majority"" -- to send a powerful message to Democrats heading into the 2020 election season.
With 62 percent of precincts reporting, Bevin was leading Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, 49.4 percent (456,332 votes) to 48.5 percent (448,018 votes). But in a worrying sign for Republicans, Bevin was underperforming..."
"WNBA star Brittney Griner was convicted Thursday in Russia of cannabis possession and sentenced to nine years in prison — despite her insistence that she “made an honest mistake” and her tearful pleas for mercy.
Standing in a cage reserved for defendants at the Khimki court outside Moscow, Griner, 31, remained stone-faced upon hearing the verdict.
As part of the punishment phase, Griner also will be required to pay a $16,300 fine. Asked if she understood the sentence, Griner replied in English: “Yes, I understand, your honor.”"
"The current balance in the US Senate is 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats (including two Independents who vote with the Democrats). In 2020, 35 seats are being contested, including two special elections for appointees replacing two senators felled by illness: Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
Democrats need three or four seats to wrest Senate control from Republicans. If Biden wins the presidency, they need three seats; if Trump is re-elected, they need four. The GOP faces daunting odds since they must defend 23 seats, almost double..."
"Judge Amy Coney Barrett said Tuesday that her family has been “attacked” during her bid for a seat on the Supreme Court, and she’s seen “caricatures floating around” concerning her Catholic faith, but said she’s going through it because she feels a duty to defend the law.
As senators kicked off the first round of questions, Judge Barrett said she knows she’s made “distinct” choices to have a large, interracial family — she has seven children, two of them adopted from Haiti — and to have a law career, but..."
"Were the Washington Redskins right to ditch their longstanding team name in favor of an as-yet-to-be-revealed substitute? While the Redskins name has been discussed for the better part of a decade, the debate is part of the broader question of the current madness for tearing down history of all kinds. Is the wiser approach to resist the woke mob at all points (the Texas Rangers are already in the mob’s sights, on logic opposite to the objection to Redskins), or is it to seek more reasoned distinctions? Whichever approach you..."
"Let us assume that for 99.99% of the U.S. population in early August 2022, the last thing on their mind was Mar-a-Lago. Instead, a short list of real things preoccupying Americans would include inflation, crime, battles in Congress over spending, Ukraine fighting World War III for us in Europe, and China conducting massive live-fire military exercises around Taiwan.
So it came as a surprise to discover Monday evening that the Justice Department and FBI decided the most important thing in the world just now was raiding former President Donald Trump’s estate..."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded its emergency use authorization for the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine to children as young as 12 Monday, the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive the green light.
The FDA had previously approved both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on children ages 16 and up, but Pfizer is the first vaccine now available to all teenagers. A CDC panel will meet Wednesday to determine how the vaccine should be administered to young children, and the vaccine will be fully cleared for use following CDC Director Rochelle..."
"Recently, James Carville, the unfrozen Clintonite of Democratic politics, stirred a predictable controversy by complaining about “wokeness” in an interview with Sean Illing of Vox. Everyone has a different definition of the term, but Carville’s was one you hear a lot from strategically minded Democrats: Wokeness is “faculty lounge” rhetoric, the language of elite hyper-educated progressivism, entering into mass politics in a way that turns a lot of normal people off.
Framed this way, intra-Democratic debates about the new progressivism often boil down to word choice and emphasis. Do you..."
"As Hillary Clinton announces her campaign today, she quite literally stands alone. She’s the sole announced Democrat candidate and the only top-shelf contender.
But that’s not going to help her in Iowa, where voters will still expect to be pandered to as if they were in the center of a hard-fought battle.
“I’ll be waiting to see how aggressively pursued I am,” Jan Bauer, a county Democrat chair, tells The Washington Post. “We really are that spoiled,” adds Bret Nilles, another county chair.
The Clinton campaign understands this–and even seems..."
"Pennsylvania and Nevada certified the results of the presidential election in favor of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, amid President Trump and his campaign's legal challenges in the key states.
“Today @PAStateDept certified the results of the November 3 election in Pennsylvania for president and vice president of the United States,” Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf tweeted. “As required by federal law, I’ve signed the Certificate of Ascertainment for the slate of electors for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.”"
"Ivana Trump, the Czech American ex-wife of former President Donald Trump and mother of Ivanka, Eric and Don Jr., died Thursday. She was 73.
Trump was discovered at the bottom of a staircase in her home on 10 E. 64th St. in Manhattan at 12:40 p.m., police sources told The Post. Authorities believe she suffered cardiac arrest, but the official cause of death has yet to be determined. She was found by cops who were called to her home for a wellness check, police said."
"New Zealanders are trying to come to grips with the worst massacre in their nation outside of wartime in more than 200 years. At least 49 people were killed in attacks against two mosques, and dozens of others were wounded.

Witnesses saw a man dressed in black enter a mosque in central Christchurch at about 1:45 p.m, then heard dozens of shots. As people fled the mosque, witnesses reported seeing ""dead people everywhere.""

"Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives are once again fleeing the state in a second bid to prevent the Republican majorities in the legislature to pass a controversial GOP-sponsored elections bill to strengthen voting access rules.
The Democratic lawmakers aim to fly to Washington, D.C. on Monday, a source with knowledge of the plans confirmed to Fox News, in order to deny the quorum needed in the House to pass the voting measures. Republicans argue the bill would provide greater election security, while Democrats charge it would suppress voter turnout of minorities. "
"President Biden signed a bipartisan gun control measure into law Saturday, predicting the legislation will “save lives.”
“I have been at this work from long long time. I know how hard it is. I was there 30 years ago the last time this nation passed meaningful gun safety laws;” Biden said. “While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that will save lives.”
First Lady Jill Biden stood by her husband’s side as he spoke.
“If we can reach compromise on guns,..."
"Conservative Republicans are pushing back hard against House Speaker John Boehner's plan to effectively push off the battle over President Obama's immigration plan to next year in order to pass a spending bill, increasing the likelihood he'll need help from Democrats to get it through the House and Senate."
"Should Russia escalate its infringement on Ukraine's national sovereignty, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear the former, and wannabe future, empire plans to do, the president-cum-dictator deserves the overwhelming bulk of the blame. But that doesn't remotely absolve President Joe Biden of blame for enabling Putin's escalation, nor does pointing out that our president failed our Ukrainian ally and aided Russia. Of course, Biden's stateside allies would have us believe the opposite."
"The Democratic head of a powerful U.S. House committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of President Donald Trump's personal and business tax returns on Wednesday, in a long-awaited move widely expected to lead to a long court battle with the White House.
The request, in a letter from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, is viewed by Democrats in the House of Representatives as a vital first step toward oversight of Trump's income taxes and business network, which some lawmakers believe..."
"U.S.-backed forces declared military victory over the Islamic State group in Syria on Saturday after liberating the last pocket of territory held by the militants, marking the end of a brutal self-styled caliphate the group carved out in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014.
The nearly five-year war that has devastated cities and towns across north Syria and Iraq ended in Baghouz, a minor border village where the cornered militants made their last stand, under a grueling siege for weeks.
On Saturday, the Syrian Democratic Forces..."
"Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the four liberal justices on the Supreme Court, sided with her conservative colleagues on Monday over a prisoner's supervisory release. She joined Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh in the majority, deciding that a criminal defendant, in this case Jason Mont, can be sentenced for violating his supervised release, even if the release expires while he is incarcerated ahead of facing new charges. Her vote was swapped with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and..."
"President Biden on Thursday is sending Congress proposals for new legislation allowing the U.S. to further crack down on Russian oligarchs as punishment for Moscow’s bloody invasion of Ukraine, the White House has announced. 
The proposed measures, which the White House says were drafted in close coordination with the Treasury, Justice, State and Commerce Departments, will ""enhance the United States Government’s authority to hold the Russian government and Russian oligarchs accountable for President Putin’s war against Ukraine."" 
""This package of proposals will establish new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, allow the..."
"The Biden administration is considering a possible ban of oil imports from Russia to the United States, but ""no decision has been made at this time,"" an administration official told Fox News.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the administration is speaking with partners and allies ""to look, in a coordinated way, at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil, while making sure there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets."""

""If you look at the breadth of this particular piece of legislation, it is the strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement piece of legislation in the country,"" DeSantis said at a press conference. ""There’s just nothing even close."""
"Former President Donald Trump intends to attack President Biden's “disastrous amnesty and border policies” in a keynote address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, his first public speaking engagement since leaving office, a source told the Washington Examiner.
Trump is scheduled to speak on the afternoon of Feb. 28, the final day of the conference, to be held in Orlando, Florida.

"House Speaker John A. Boehner offered the first olive branch Wednesday in what is expected to be a frenetic spate of postelection deal-making to avert the looming “fiscal cliff, saying the GOP will let the government collect more tax revenue if President Obama will drop his plan to raise tax rates on the wealthy."
"President Biden on Monday hosted Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi at the White House to announce a planned end to the US military’s combat mission in Iraq.
The largely symbolic announcement means US troops will transfer most combat duties to Iraq’s military this year. But unlike in Afghanistan, Biden will keep a large US military footprint in Iraq.
Biden stressed that US troops aren’t leaving Iraq entirely — as happened in 2011, setting the stage for the Islamic State group to seize a third of the country, resulting in a US..."
"A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a COVID relief package on Tuesday morning that represents a compromise between Republicans and Democrats as negotiations are stalled. The package totals $908 billion, and includes funding for unemployment insurance, state and local governments, vaccine development, education, housing subsidies, child care, the paycheck protection program (PPP), and other COVID-related causes.
Co-sponsors of the legislation includes Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME) and others. The $908 billion price tag is higher than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would like, and..."
"When Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) was seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, a local paper noted that he had ""a long history speaking out against marijuana legalization."" Given that history and the fact that Rubio's position is rejected by two-thirds of Americans, you might think he would be prepared to defend marijuana prohibition with cogent arguments.
If so, you would be wrong. In a recent interview with a Pensacola TV station, Rubio worried that legalization would encourage teenagers to use cannabis, which would be a ""gateway"" to other drugs, and warned that black-market marijuana is ""laced..."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday praised the battle-readiness of his armed forces and his ever-developing hypersonic missiles — as Ukraine declared a state of emergency and started enlisting military reservists.
Putin made his latest clear warning in a video address as he continued to move as many as 190,000 troops on the borders with Ukraine, which declared it would introduce a 30-day nationwide state of emergency.
The move, which is expected to get parliamentary approval within 48 hours, would allow additional protection for public facilities, restrictions on traffic, and additional transport..."
"More people will need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before travel restrictions can be lifted, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday published guidelines for people who have been vaccinated, relaxing restrictions on who they could meet indoors without social distancing, for example.
But the new recommendations did not change restrictions on travel. That means people wanting to travel to visit family or friends face a long wait until more of the population is vaccinated against COVID-19.
Psaki was asked..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to allow an impeachment trial against President Donald Trump to go ahead, calling a vote to acquit him after proceedings have run their course rather than seeking to immediately dismiss the charges, some Republican senators say.
Acquittal, rather than a procedural vote to dismiss the articles of impeachment, would definitively clear the president of the charges raised against him by Democrats and expected to be approved by the House of Representatives.
It would ""make more sense"" to vote on the articles of impeachment..."
"At least nine people have been killed as protests against the Islamist regime in Iran escalated Thursday, with protesters setting fire to police buildings and stabbing a regime enforcer.
Thousands of protesters have gathered across the country following the police-custody death of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by Iranian morality police for not wearing a head covering. Protests have become increasingly violent in major cities like Tehran, where police stations and vehicles have gone up in flames.
Protesters also stabbed a member of the Basij, a pro-government paramilitary organization, according..."

Results will be tabulated, signed, sealed, and sent by registered mail to Vice President Mike Pence.
A number of states have laws that require electors to support the winner of the state’s election, while electors in other states do so in accordance with custom. President-elect Joe Biden won 306 electoral votes to President Trump’s 232."

Biden should choose a vice presidential nominee who reinforces his main message, just as Clinton, in 1992, chose Al Gore to reinforce Clinton’s message as a somewhat centrist Democrat and an avatar of a new generation of leaders.
Clinton, like Biden, was under pressure from the leftmost elements in the Democratic Party to pick a more liberal running mate. In Clinton’s case, the conventional wisdom also suggested..."

Economists had expected claims to fall to 460,000 from the initially reported 4730,000 in the prior week. The prior week was revised up to 478,000.
The 4-week moving average—which smooths out data that is often volatile week to week—fell to 504,750, a decrease of 30,500 from the previous week’s revised average.
Initial claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27, 2020, more than ten times..."

JCS said the missiles were launched from central North Korea and that South Korea, along with U.S. intelligence authorities, is currently analyzing more details about the launches.
Japan’s coast guard said it believes the two missiles were launched five minutes apart, at 12:38 p.m. and 12:43 p.m. local time (11:38 p.m. and 11:43 p.m. ET) and that they landed outside its exclusive economic zone in the waters between Japan and the Korean..."
"The Trump Organization charged the Secret Service hundreds or thousands of dollars above the government rate for stays at its hotels while protecting the 45th president and his family members on dozens of trips, according to receipts released Monday in a report by the House Oversight Committee.
Committee Chair Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) accused Trump of profiting off taxpayer funds by lodging agents in his eponymous hotels at rates “as high as $1,185 per night,” in a letter to Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle revealing the findings.
“The exorbitant rates charged to..."
"Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday announced a new set of precautionary measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 amid a “very substantial” increase in virus cases in recent days.
During a press conference in Prospect Park, the mayor rolled out a six-part plan that includes increasing the number of testing sites in the Big Apple and distributing KN95 masks to New Yorkers.
“We have seen very substantial increases COVID cases in the last few days,” he said Thursday afternoon. “It is clear that the Omicron variant is here..."
"Two Senate Republicans released a report on Wednesday detailing Joseph R. Biden’s alleged conflicts of interest tied to his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in countries where the former vice president was wielding considerable influence at the time.

“What the Chairmen discovered during the course of this investigation is that the Obama administration..."
"An appeals court on Wednesday granted the Justice Department's request to block a hold by U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon related to the seizure of sensitive documents at former President Trump's Florida estate. 
The ruling by the three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit said that Cannon mistakenly prevented federal prosecutors from using 100 documents with classification markings as part of the criminal probe. 
""It is self-evident that the public has a strong interest in ensuring that the storage of the classified records did not result in..."
"President Donald Trump President Donald Trump will announce an executive action to continue his fight to include a citizenship question on the 2020 U.S. Census, the latest sign he may not be dissuaded after being rebuffed by the Supreme Court.
The executive action is expected to be announced at a news conference Thursday, according to three people familiar with Trump’s plan. The people declined to detail what the executive action would do, but indicated it may not be an executive order.
The people, who asked for anonymity because the plan..."
"President Biden insisted Friday that the Nov. 8 midterm elections aren’t a “referendum” on him while touting “a record decrease” in the federal deficit — despite the fact that it was elevated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and his own first-year stimulus spending and again is on the upswing due to his cancellation of student debt.
“The election is not a referendum. It’s a choice. It’s a choice,” Biden said at the White House. “And the Republicans criticize my economic record. But look at what I’ve inherited. And what I’ve..."
"I happen to think Mitt Romney is a pretty good member of the United States Senate. Disagreements aside, he brings ideas and a unique kind of independence to the job.
Especially disagreeable, in my estimation, however, is the statement he’s released announcing that he will vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.
In a world where members of both parties crossed the aisle to support each other’s nominees to the bench, it would be an eminently reasonable decision and rationale. In this one, it’s malpractice. Democrats..."
"The Iranian regime is behind spoof emails sent to Americans, “designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Wednesday night. He added an assurance that despite claims to the contrary in the emails, “your votes are secure.”

"China said on Monday it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, striking back in its trade war with Washington shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump warned it not to retaliate.
China’s finance ministry said it plans to set import tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent on 5,140 U.S. products on a target list worth about $60 billion. It said the tariffs will take effect on June 1.
The announcement came less than two hours after Trump warned Beijing not to retaliate after China said..."
"Irish voters have resoundingly backed amending the constitution to legalize gay marriage, leaders on both sides of the Irish referendum declared Saturday after the world's first national vote on the issue.
As the official ballot counting continued, the only question appeared to be how large the ""yes"" margin of victory from Friday's vote would be. Analysts said the ""yes"" support was likely to exceed 60 percent nationally when official results are announced later Saturday.

"President Biden finally held his first press conference on Thursday — during which he denied the migrant crisis at the southern border, pinned the burden of national unity on the GOP and hedged when asked if he expects to run for re-election.
Biden fielded journalists’ questions in a formal setting for the first time in more than two months into his presidency and was promptly grilled on the growing wave of migrants at the US-Mexico border."
"Watch out, COVID-19, Eric Adams says he’s bringing “swagger” back.
On Day 3 of his mayoralty, Adams declared Monday that he’s bringing to the Big Apple a “swagger” that was “missing” during the COVID-19 pandemic’s doldrums under predecessor Bill de Blasio. 
“When a mayor has swagger, the city has swagger,” Adams boasted at Concourse Village Elementary School, where he was flanked by new schools Chancellor David Banks. 
“We’ve allowed people to beat us down so much that all we did was wallow in COVID –that’s all we did — and we no longer believed this is a city of swagger, this is..."
"President Trump issued a statement Wednesday calling for “peace” and urging supporters who stormed the Capitol to “go home” but repeating his claims that the presidential election was stolen from him.
“I know your pain. I know your hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump said in a video shot outside the White House. “It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it — especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.”
Members of Congress met in a..."
"People across the US have come forward to call the anti-malaria drug a 'miracle' coronavirus treatment as New York state officials announce they will start trials with the medication on Tuesday.
On Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will doctors will start trialing hydroxychloroquine this week after the number of coronavirus cases in New York City alone rose to 12,000, an increase of more than 3,000 overnight.
The drug has not yet been proven as effective in battling the virus, but President Donald Trump drummed up..."
"The governors of New Jersey and New York are rethinking their reopening plans amid alarming spikes in new cases and hospitalizations across the South.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday that the planned end of the ban on indoor restaurant dining, initially set for Thursday, is canceled. He cited surges in several other states, “driven by, in part, the return of indoor dining.”
""We've always said that we would not hesitate to hit pause if needed to safeguard public health,"" Murphy tweeted. ""This is one of those times."""
"For Congress, not that much, since both parties do it.
On Thursday morning, a 5–4 Supreme Court decision closed the door on having federal courts police partisan gerrymandering. The Court’s decision left standing a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland’s House districts and a Republican gerrymander in North Carolina’s, both of which were openly partisan. The Court’s decisions are, predictably, reviving the ongoing debate over the centuries-old practice of gerrymandering: state legislatures drawing congressional and state legislative districts to favor their own political party. Partisan gerrymandering is political self-interest in its..."
"The Supreme Court has definitively declined to involve federal courts in the Game of Thrones that is redistricting, ruling that conflicts over partisan gerrymandering are best left to politicians and the electoral process.
The two cases resolved Thursday surely presented the strongest imaginable temptation to impose the judicial will on the wheel of politics: North Carolina Democrats and Maryland Republicans alleged that redistricting plans not only discriminated against them based on their political views, they also handicapped their First Amendment associational freedoms."
"Senate Democrats Sunday blocked a critical economic relief package worth more than $2 trillion, stalling plans to pass the bill by Monday and send it to the House.
Lawmakers and the Trump administration hoped to send a positive message to unstable stock markets and to those worried about the damage to the economy and job losses caused by the spread of the virus.
The measure includes sending direct cash payments that would average about $3,000 per family and expanding unemployment insurance, as well as $350 billion in aid to struggling..."

Dr. Kent Brantly was able to walk, with help, from the helicopter that transported him on Saturday to Atlanta, where he was being..."
"Joe Biden, giving an inaugural address so forgettable that he himself seemed to have forgotten much of it, emphasized the need for “unity.”
He is not the first with the unity talk. Barack Obama talked up unity in his 2009 inaugural, insisting that Americans must choose “unity of purpose over conflict and discord.” Donald Trump was not famous for his enthusiasm for unity, but he nodded to it: “We are one nation,” etc. Ronald Reagan valorized the American public as a whole: “You have shown a watching world that we..."
"Steve Bannon is expected to turn himself in to New York authorities in Manhattan on Thursday to face a new indictment connected to his ""We Build the Wall"" fundraising effort.  
The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that the state criminal case would resemble an earlier attempted federal prosecution, in which Bannon was accused of duping donors who gave money to fund a wall on the U.S. southern border.
Bannon, a former Trump senior adviser, was previously federally indicted for fraud in the private fundraising campaign.

"One morning before heading into my office in San Antonio, I overslept. When I awoke, the house was silent. I couldn’t recall anyone telling me good morning, goodbye, or have a good day. My mind was blank. I was in a bad place.
I went into the bathroom and grabbed my pistol from the top shelf. I cocked the gun and put the cold steel barrel in my mouth. I stared in the mirror and saw a man who was not me. I began to cry and broke down on..."
"Iowa's largest newspaper is in the middle of a firestorm after publishing a report that dug up old, offensive tweets from a local man who raised over $1 million he then donated to charity.
A piece published by the Des Moines Register profiled a 24-year-old Iowan native, Carson King, who became a TV sensation last weekend after he held up a sign at a football game asking people to donate money to him. He requested that they donate the funds through Venmo so he could buy his ""supply"" of Busch..."
"President Biden is keeping refugee admissions at 15,000 this fiscal year -- the level set at the end of the Trump administration -- despite earlier proposals to dramatically increase it to over 60,000.
A senior administration official said Friday that Biden will be signing an emergency presidential determination to keep the number at 15,000 while changing the regional allocation of who is brought in -- allowing more slots from Africa, the Middle East and Central America, while ending restrictions on Somalia, Yemen and Syria."
"The Senate voted 50-49 along party lines to confirm Xavier Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services on Thursday.
Senator Susan Collins (R., Maine) was the lone Republican to vote in favor of Becerra’s confirmation. Senator Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii) did not vote on Thursday.
Earlier this month, the Senate Finance Committee was tied 14-14 along party lines in its vote to advance Becerra’s nomination. Because of the tie, the vote to advance Becerra’s nomination was moved to the entire Senate, which voted on Wednesday to advance the confirmation..."

Host Kasie Hunt teased an upcoming segment at the left-wing network Wednesday on the furor over Joe Biden saying he used to be able to work with senators who were segregationists and lamenting the partisanship of today.
He named Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
“Still to come, Joe Biden references his relationships with two former Republican colleagues at an event in New York City. The only problem? They were both segregationists,” she said...."

Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell only came to be the Senate majority leader with the 2014 elections when the GOP gained a sparse majority in the upper chamber, but for Jindal and many conservatives at the Summit, McConnell has already proven he isn’t up for..."
"Democrats and Republicans linked arms Monday and rushed to pass a new round of coronavirus relief, saying they were delivering a measure of hope to families grimly confronting the holidays and new year amid a new round of shutdowns.
The bill, which also included full funding for all other government operations in 2021, cleared both chambers with strong bipartisan support late Monday night. It now needs to be signed into law by President Trump.
The package passed with less than 20 minutes to spare before the midnight deadline, but Congress..."
"The age of woke entertainment built its castle on the sand and with every new attempt to build on it, the castle becomes more and more unstable. Studios reach for excuses as to why, and it typically involves blaming fans and viewers.

"As prejudices go, anti-Semitism can sometimes be hard to pin down, but on Thursday the opinion pages of The New York Times international edition provided a textbook illustration of it.
Except that The Times wasn’t explaining anti-Semitism. It was purveying it.
It did so in the form of a cartoon, provided to the newspaper by a wire service and published directly above an unrelated column by Tom Friedman, in which a guide dog with a prideful countenance and the face of Benjamin Netanyahu leads a blind, fat Donald Trump wearing..."
"Critics on both ends of the political spectrum went full blast on President Biden's claim Monday that states are responsible for solving the coronavirus crisis, pointing out Biden's long history of claiming he would bring the country out of the pandemic.
They also noted Biden's federal government has moved to impose vaccine mandates and requirements to wear mask while traveling on planes and trains – much to the chagrin of many Republican governors. 
Christina Pushaw, press secretary for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, posted a montage of Biden's statements saying that..."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, giving into demands from her party's leading presidential candidate and her top lieutenants that Congress attempt to oust the sitting president.

"Gas prices hit a new all-time high on May 10, 2022, amid rising inflation and President Biden's restrictions on oil and gas production.
According to AAA's average gas price calculator, the national average cost of a regular gallon of gasoline hit $4.374 on Tuesday, the highest ever according to AAA.
The prices come as the European Union edges toward oil sanctions on Russia amid the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. It also comes amid record-high inflation, with the consumer price index reaching 8.5% in March.

Current and former workers across the political spectrum have made complaints according to the Journal, which cited people it didn't identify."
"You can tell someone is smarting from an inferiority complex when he insists on being addressed as “Dr.” on the basis of holding an academic doctorate rather than being a physician. Ph.D. holders who have genuine accomplishments don’t make you call them “Doctor,” which is why you never hear about “Dr. Paul Krugman” and “Dr. George Will.” None of the professors I knew at Yale, even the ones who were eminent in their fields, insisted on the title, and I think most of them would have scoffed if someone had..."
"The stories are endless. The list of liberal media screw-ups when covering this White House is endless. You would think that there would be a learning curve or something. Nope. They still can’t accurately report on the Trump White House. All I can say is ‘watch out for that rake.’ It all started with President Trump’s first visit to Japan, where a simple photo op between the president and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe feeding koi fish wasn’t reported properly. Fish feeding was the source of fake news, folks. That’s how..."
"The walls evidently aren’t closing in on President Joe Biden. 
Despite the mainstream press finally taking up the sleazy business dealings discussed in e-mails found on Hunter Biden’s laptop, the media’s lack of interest in Joe Biden’s knowledge or involvement in this lucrative part of the family business is palpable. 
If President Donald Trump were caught up in similar circumstances, he’d be hounded at every press conference and during every walk to Marine One with the questions: What did he know and when did he know it? It’d dominate cable news and the Sunday..."
"Under cover of the global coronavirus crisis, China is moving to rewrite Asia’s geopolitical map. Beijing has announced it will essentially take control of Hong Kong by directly imposing a sweeping national-security law, bypassing the territory’s elected Legislative Council. Despite repeated assurances by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that it would abide by the 1984 agreement with Great Britain to allow Hong Kong to maintain a loose independence under the so-called “one-country, two-systems” framework for 50 years after the 1997 turnover, the past decade has seen a steady erosion of..."

Massachusetts’ current governor, Republican Charlie Baker, decided not to run for a third term.

"Pressure is mounting for former Vice President Joe Biden to finally address the allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer when Biden was a senator in the mid-1990s.
Up until now, the legacy media has formed a bit of a barricade around the Democrat's presumptive nominee for president by simply ignoring the story altogether, a privilege they did not afford now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation process.
As Mollie Hemingway has pointed out at The Federalist, the double standard in how media outlets treated unfounded, uncorroborated allegations..."
"When Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential primary, the media decided that they were suddenly very, very concerned that the former vice president was so touchy-feely with women, grabbing them and sniffing their hair. Biden's relentless touchiness and lack of respect for personal space had been documented and memed for years, but it only became a problem once he stood in the way of a madam president.
Biden should feel very lucky that Tara Reade waited before speaking up in greater detail until after he had clinched the Democratic nomination...."

"GOP presidential hopefuls turned up their attacks Saturday on Hillary Clinton -- taking turns piling on the 2016 Democratic presidential frontrunner during a party summit in New Hampshire.
The first five 2016 GOP presidential candidates or potential candidates used at least some of their stage time at the Republican Leadership Summit, in Nashua, N.H., to criticize Clinton, who is scheduled to be in the state Monday and Tuesday.
“I’m starting to worry that when Clinton travels she'll need two planes -- one for her and her e"
"The White House began grading itself on a curve for Obamacare enrollment Monday, claiming that a goal of 80 percent recruitment among all users of the website would be nearly the best result possible.
With the administration unlikely to meet its Nov. 30 deadline for making the website fully operational, President Obama’s aides offered the new explanation that some consumers never would have signed up online anyway. Therefore, they said, 80 percent enrollment would be a success."
"The director of the National Security Agency says surveillance programs have disrupted or helped disrupt dozens of terrorist attacks.
NSA director Keith Alexander defended the programs at a Senate hearing on Wednesday and also called claims that the spy agency can tap into any Americans’ phone calls or emails “false.”
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont says some details of two cases have been declassified. He pressed Alexander for numbers"
"Republican Glenn Youngkin's shocking defeat of Democrat Terry McAuliffe Tuesday in the Virginia gubernatorial contest will almost certainly serve as a blueprint for Republicans in the post-Trump era.
Youngkin’s victory was consistent with late October polls that showed him burning through McAuliffe’s summer lead and claiming a modest advantage on the strength of his message about education and the economy.
Rising prices and drama at school board meetings created the ideal backdrop for Youngkin’s devotion to the kitchen-table issues that McAuliffe was widely perceived as having ignored, as he focused more on..."
"President Trump’s quest to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census ended Tuesday, with the administration caving on the plans, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling and an intractable time crunch.
A Justice Department attorney, in an email that found its way onto Twitter, said the department had finalized the questionnaire and given the green light to print it without the citizenship question.
The decision is a symbolic blow to Mr. Trump, who staked significant political capital on his ability to get the question added and who had said..."
"Rep. Liz Cheney said Monday that then-President Donald Trump took 2020 election night guidance from “an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani” over his campaign experts.
In an opening statement during a hearing of the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, Cheney, the panel’s vice chairwoman, said that despite widely circulated reports of how mail-in ballots would be tallied, Trump took Giuliani’s advice to shift other staffers’ election night plans.
“You will also hear testimony that President Trump rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night and instead followed the..."
"President Trump ramped up his criticism on Monday of Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leading experts on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to a degree that has yet to be seen in public.
As Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has sought to remain apolitical and focused on encouraging social distancing and mask-wearing, Trump, espousing cavalier attitude toward health precautions during the pandemic, has grown increasingly wary of the difference in messaging.
That frustration appeared to reach a boiling point during a..."
"President-elect Donald Trump blasted Boeing on Tuesday for alleged cost overruns on a new fleet of Air Force One planes and called for the government to cancel the contract, saying the project price tag is ""out of control.""
The president-elect took aim at Boeing's Air Force One work in a Tuesday morning tweet, and reiterated his concerns to reporters minutes later at Trump Tower."
"Only foreign visitors who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to travel to the United States starting on Nov. 8, according to the White House.
“The [United States’] new travel policy that requires vaccination for foreign national travelers to the United States will begin on Nov 8,”  Kevin Munoz, White House assistant press secretary, wrote on Twitter Friday. “This announcement and date applies to both international air travel and land travel. This policy is guided by public health, stringent, and consistent.”
Munoz did not elaborate on travel restrictions for children who are not..."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that children as young as 12 can now get booster shots of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine. 
The decision comes as the omicron variant is rapidly spreading around the U.S. and complicating plans for students to return to classrooms following winter breaks. 
Boosters already are recommended for everyone 16 and older, and federal regulators on Monday decided they’re also warranted for 12- to 15-year-olds once enough time has passed since their last dose. 
The FDA also said everyone 12 and older eligible for a..."
"President Trump raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, more than any of his Democratic rivals to date, his re-election campaign announced.
The campaign said in a statement that the final three months of the year marked their best fundraising quarter to date in this election cycle, and left the team with $102.7 million in cash on hand.
“President Trump’s unprecedented fundraising is testament to his wide grassroots support and his stellar record of achievement on behalf of the American people,” Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said..."
"The Supreme Court Monday issued two unsigned opinions applying qualified immunity to disputes over alleged excessive use of force by police officers, reversing lower court decisions that allowed the officers to be sued for their on-the-job conduct. 
There were no recorded dissents in the two cases, both of which involved police officers responding to domestic disputes where women or children were allegedly being threatened by adult men. 
The decisions come amid a simmering debate about the doctrine of qualified immunity, which prevents government officials from being sued for violating citizens' rights while reasonably doing their jobs..."
"Several Democratic senators thought to be potential presidential contenders in 2020 -- including Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar -- are set to grill William Barr, President Trump's attorney general nominee, during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday."
"As Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney consider seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, the former governors have a long history of ambition and ""competitiveness and snippiness"" that could easily play out during any campaign, The Washington Post reports.
""We’re seeing the first shots of the war between clan Romney and clan Bush,"" Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who has worked for both men, told The Post. ""Both bring to the battle incredibly powerful fan clubs as well as wounds they have to heal.
""How ugly could it get?"" he asked...."
"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) announced on Sunday that he has tested positive for coronavirus, which originated in China.
“Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for COVID-19,” Paul’s staff wrote on Twitter. “He is feeling fine and is in quarantine. He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.”"
"The Justice Department indicted two “Proud Boys” on charges of ""conspiracy"" and a host of other crimes for their role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol in early January, with the indictment coming just a few days after investigators charged a trio of “Oath Keepers” with conspiracy related to the Capitol siege too.
Dominic Pezzola and William Pepe, both New York members of the right-wing Proud Boys (described as a “nationalist organization with multiple U.S. chapters and potential activity in other Western countries""), had been hit with charges of..."
"President Trump on Thursday hosted several hundred conservative activists at the White House for a ""social media summit"" to discuss anti-conservative bias by big tech companies, telling attendees that ""we’re not going to be silenced.""
The meeting, which took place in the East Room of the White House, included discussion about accusations that companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter have treated conservatives unfairly. The president also complimented the conservatives in attendance for what they've post online, saying, ""Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable.""

"Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and his Republican challenger  Herschel Walker  faced off Friday night in  Savannah  for their widely anticipated debate, tackling inflation , abortion, drugs, fake police officers, and more. 
The high-stakes matchup between the seasoned orator who delivered sermons on Sunday from the pulpit of the famed Ebenezer Baptist Church and the Georgia football legend could determine which party takes control of the Senate next year.
Walker flatly denied bombshell allegations that he paid a former girlfriend to get an abortion, calling it ""a lie."" The mother of one..."
"Two prominent Hong Kong activists, Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, were arrested Friday for participating in unauthorized assembly and inciting other protesters to do the same. Both have been released on bail. Hong Kong police have also denied organizers permission to hold a march planned for Saturday.
The two 22-year-olds are leaders of Demosisto, an organization that backs greater autonomy and self-government for Hong Kong. (Wong serves as secretary-general while Chow is on the standing committee.) Wong first entered protest politics during Hong Kong's ""umbrella movement"" of 2014. Those roughly..."
"A federal judge on Monday has ruled that lockdown restrictions imposed by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), including a ban on large gatherings and the closure of ""non-life sustaining businesses,"" are unconstitutional.
While those restrictions were ""well-intentioned,"" wrote U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV, ""good intentions toward a laudable end are not alone enough to uphold governmental action against a constitutional challenge. Indeed, the greatest threats to our system of constitutional liberties may arise when the ends are laudable and the intent is good—especially in time of emergency.""
In May,..."
"The U.S. economy recorded an increase of 431,000 jobs in March as COVID-19 concerns ease and more Americans seek work to combat the surging cost of living.
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 431,000 in March while the unemployment rate dipped to 3.6%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones predicted the U.S. economy would add 490,000 jobs.
Recent gains in the labor market have allowed the U.S. economy to recover over 90% of the 22 million jobs lost during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, The New York..."
"Canada has announced a ban (mostly symbolic) on Russian petroleum imports. The United States has not, because we have hamstrung ourselves. In spite of being the world’s largest oil producer — by far — we continue to import enormous quantities of oil and other petroleum products. That isn’t a bad thing in and of itself, but it does limit some of our options — and, in this case, it does so unnecessarily and, indeed, destructively.
There are four things to know here.
First:
The big immediate issue with U.S. petroleum production..."
"Archbishop Welby said the Queen modeled the servant leadership expressed in the life of Jesus, who was her Savior.
“People of loving service are rare in any walk of life,” he said. “Leaders of loving service are still rarer. But in all cases, those who serve will be loved and remembered when those who cling to power and privileges are long forgotten.”
The Westminster Abbey funeral drew a packed crowd of 2,000 global heads of state, including U.S. President Biden, as well as family and select friends.
As many as..."
"Two-thirds of Americans said they would not return to ""normal life"" until a vaccine becomes available for COVID-19, according to CNN.
The ramifications of this finding would be well worth discussing, since the timeline for a vaccine is unknowable: It could be available next year, in three years, or never. But it turns out that the headline, ""68% of Americans say a vaccine is needed before returning to normal life, new survey finds,"" is fake news.
The CNN article cites a Gallup poll as its source. But Gallup did not..."
"CNN has been accused of “an egregious misreading of the data” used in a recent report claiming 68 percent of Americans say they need a coronavirus vaccine before returning to ""normal life.""
CNN published an article Monday that declared in its headline, “68% of Americans say a vaccine is needed before returning to normal life,” citing a “new survey.” It cited “two new Gallup surveys” but didn’t link to either of them. CNN promoted the story with a tweet using the same statistic.
Nicholas Grossman, an international relations professor at..."
"Sens. Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski teamed up Monday to call on top lawmakers to take up a bipartisan reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, a move aimed at steering Democrats away from a partisan and sweeping election overhaul bill that is stalled in the Senate.
Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, wrote to the top leaders in both parties in Congress urging them to push the Voting Rights Act reauthorization through the House and Senate and pass it with the support of both parties.
“Congress..."
"Labor Day was never intended as an homage to the organized labor movement.
Unions, of course, vehemently disagree, and while the overwhelming majority of people have come to regard the holiday as nothing more meaningful than a three-day weekend commemorating the end of summer, labor leaders continue to delude themselves that the event somehow validates their dubious ideals and shady tactics.
This would come as a profound surprise to those instrumental in its founding.
For example, Rep. Lawrence McGann, an Illinois Democrat who sat on the House committee that approved the..."
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom heads into the Golden State recall Tuesday with the wind at his back after the last polls of the race show voters want to keep him in the job.
A Survey USA and the San Diego Union-Tribune poll showed 54 percent of likely voters saying Newsom should stay in office, while just 41 percent said they planned to vote “yes” on the recall. A second Berkeley Institute of Government Studies and Los Angeles Times survey showed Newsom coasting by an even bigger margin, with 60 percent of likely..."
"Attorney General William Barr is resigning, confirming speculation that he would leave his top cabinet post amid mounting criticism of his performance from President Trump.
Trump announced the departure in a Monday evening tweet.
“Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family,” Trump tweeted."
"Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is set to plead guilty Monday to charges he endangered comrades by walking away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 -- the court case wrapping up just three years after a stunning Rose Garden spectacle in which former President Barack Obama, flanked by Bergdahl's parents, triumphantly announced the soldier's release from captivity."
"Although the president is still out on the campaign trail sounding the hysterical alarm over the proportionally miniscule sequester cuts, the Wall Street Journal reports that Beltway Democrats are already shifting their focus to the next manufactured crisis of their own making:
Already looking past the current budget impasse gripping the capital, congressional leaders are quietly considering a deal to avert a government shutdown next monthÃ¢â‚¬â€but at the cost of prolonging across-the-board spending cuts. Attention is beginning to shift from Friday, when the broad cuts known as the sequester kick..."
"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday that his government is introducing legislation to ""implement national freeze on handgun ownership"" throughout the country. 
""What this means is that it will no longer be possible to buy, sell, transfer or import handguns anywhere in Canada,"" Trudeau said at a press conference. 
""We recognize that the vast majority of gun owners use them safely and in accordance with the law, but other than using firearms for sport shooting and hunting, there is no reason anyone in Canada should need guns in their everyday..."
"Ron Wright, a Texas lawmaker representing the state's 6th Congressional District, died at the age of 67, his office said.
The congressman had battled both the coronavirus and cancer in the time leading up to his death Sunday.
“Congressman Wright will be remembered as a constitutional conservative. He was a statesman, not an ideologue,” according to a statement released by Wright’s office. “Ron and Susan dedicated their lives to fighting for individual freedom, Texas values, and above all, the lives of the unborn. As friends, family, and many of his..."
"The number of abortions performed in Texas plummeted in the first month since a new law — which prohibits the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected — went into effect.
In September 2021, just 2,197 abortions were performed in Texas, a drop of 51 percent from 5,400 statewide abortions in August, according to new figures released by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.
The Supreme Court has declined the opportunity to review the law, dismissing most legal challenges to it. A unique enforcement mechanism in the law allows individuals to..."
"President Biden says the prospect of patriots taking on a future tyrannical government in the U.S. would be grim unless they procured “F-15s and nuclear weapons.”
The Democrat roiled viewers on Tuesday while making the comments in conjunction with his calls for more stringent gun control.
“Those who say the blood of patriots, you know, and all the stuff about how we’re gonna have to move against the government — well, the tree of liberty has not been watered with the blood of patriots,” Mr. Biden said. “What’s happened is that there have never been —..."
"In his latest splurge of nonsensical gun control rhetoric, Joe Biden raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he repeated his claim that the Second Amendment always limited both who could own a weapon and the kinds of weapons available and then appeared to threaten the gun owners by alluding to the U.S. military’s overwhelming firepower. 
“The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own,” Biden said. “You couldn’t buy a cannon. [Those who] say..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it is monitoring 63 patients in 22 states for possible instances of the coronavirus, which has spread quickly from its epicenter in Wuhan, China.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday that 11 of the 63 patients have tested negative for the virus, while two have tested positive, including a Chicago woman who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 13. The woman, 60, is being treated in isolation and is said to be in stable..."
"A trio of epidemiologists released a public letter last week rebuking the lockdown-focused approach to combating COVID-19. Their alternative: a model called Focused Protection, outlined in their Great Barrington Declaration, which would reopen society and allow young people to live their lives normally while implementing safeguards for the elderly.
Reactions were predictably polarized, as coronavirus proposals have tended to be. It's been hailed as the ""best advice"" and condemned as ""grotesque."" So who's right?
Let's start with the gist of the declaration: ""Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on..."
"Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) abruptly yanked all five Republican appointees from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) Democrat-led committee investigating the January 6th Capitol riot after Pelosi refused to seat Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Jim Banks (R-IN) over concerns that the two GOP Members would impact the “integrity of the investigation.”
McCarthy announced his picks for the Select Committee on Monday, balancing out three more moderate Republicans with two supporters of former President Donald Trump, likely in order to ensure that Pelosi seated the full..."
"As the Second World War came to a rumbling close, the architects gazed out upon a shattered Europe utterly convinced of a series of new things: First, they, the architects, are in charge of architecture, and the only valid experts on the aesthetics of architecture. Therefore, the public and its leaders, who every day must view and live among their work, have no opinion that counts.
Elites as judge, jury, and, ultimately, executioner. Sound familiar? It’s all over the art world and much of politics. But recent moves in Washington..."
"Democrats who want to change Senate rules for temporary political gain will rue the day, as they have before.
“You’ll regret this, and you may regret this a lot sooner than you think.”
That was my warning to Senate Democrats in November 2013. Their leader, Harry Reid, had just persuaded them to trample longstanding Senate rules and precedents. Now that some Democrats are proposing further radical changes to the Senate’s functioning, it is instructive to recall what happened next.
To confirm more of President Barack Obama’s controversial nominees, Democrats took..."
"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers, policy makers, and journalists have viewed hospitalizations as an important indicator of the disease burden, often citing increases in that measure as a justification for government interventions aimed at curtailing virus transmission, such as business restrictions and mask requirements. Hospitalization numbers do have advantages over case tallies, which are highly dependent on who happens to be tested, and fatality reports, which are a lagging indicator, since deaths may be recorded weeks after diagnosis. But because hospitalization rates reflect patients who test positive..."
"Well, that was different. Thursday night’s Fox News debate – the last before Iowans go to caucus on Monday – was perhaps the most policy oriented that we’ve seen thus far. This was due, in large part, to the missing elephant in the room: Donald Trump.
It follows that the evening was the chance for all the other candidates to make their voices heard without Trump dominating, as he has in the past six debates. And while I wouldn't argue that there was a runaway winner this evening, it’s clear..."
"They shouted in Arabic “Allahu Akbar” (Allah is Greatest) and “We are avenging the Prophet Mohammed” as they sprayed their victims with hundreds of bullets from their semi-automatic weapons.

"Representative Eric Swalwell (D-CA) on Monday announced his intention for running for president on ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.""
Not everyone was excited about the what they saw. In fact, Swalwell has made a name for himself as anti-gunner and, like practically every other 2020 Democrat, plans to run on the gun control issue.
While he wants to be known as a strong supporter of ""gun safety,"" his claim to fame is wanting to nuke gun owners.
Congressman Eric Swalwell is focusing on fighting gun violence, and..."
"Democrats keep telling Americans they have the votes and a mandate to pass the biggest tax increase since 1968 and the biggest domestic spending bill ever. Yet they also claim they’re helpless to raise the federal debt ceiling without Republican votes.
It’s a preposterous position, albeit of the sort this Administration often tries to sell. Such as: The soaring number of illegal border crossings in Texas is merely “seasonal,” the Afghanistan withdrawal was a success, and the cost of the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill is “zero.”"
"Upcoming presidential debate host Steve Scully drew attention for a deleted tweet — possibly intended as a direct message — to outspoken anti-Trump figure Anthony Scaramucci asking whether he should “respond” to criticism directed his way by President Trump.
“@Scaramucci should I respond to trump,” Scully tweeted."
"Sen. Bernard Sanders captured a surprise win in the Indiana primary Tuesday, giving his campaign more fuel to fight until the Democratic National Convention in July and frustrating Hillary Clinton, who desperately wants to shift into general election mode.
Networks called the race by 9:10 p.m. EDT, just over two hours after the Indiana polls closed. With 84 percent of the vote counted at 10 p.m., Mr. Sanders had 53 percent compared with 47 percent for Mrs. Clinton.
The Indiana win ends an impressive string of victories for Mrs. Clinton,..."
"U.S. athletes and attendees at the Beijing Winter Games will likely be forced to use technology linked to Chinese Communist Party repression thanks to selections by China and the International Olympic Committee.
The 2022 Games have been dubbed the ""Genocide Olympics"" by leaders and activists who believe the competition should not be held in a country responsible for a host of human rights abuses. The United States concluded that the CCP is conducting a genocide against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang in western China."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence strongly suggested he would rather his old boss, Donald Trump, not be the 2024 Republican nominee for president.
During an event Wednesday night hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics in Washington, D.C., Pence was asked if he would vote for Trump if he becomes the nominee.
""Well, there might be somebody else I’d prefer more,"" Pence said, prompting a wave of applause in the room.
""You know, what I can tell you is I have every confidence that the Republican Party is going to sort out leadership,""..."
"A detailed fact-check published Monday tore into an IRS official's claim that the agency's scrutiny of conservative groups started in response to an influx of nonprofit applications, showing the practice started well before the forms started flooding in.
The piece in The Washington Post disputed a central claim that Lois Lerner, head of the exempt organizations division, and other IRS officials made as they admitted to targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny as they sought tax-exempt status."
"The New York Times on Oct. 24 published an article by tech columnist Kevin Roose about The Epoch Times. The article was published on the front page of the NY Times’ Sunday edition on Oct. 25.
Roose worked on this article about The Epoch Times for at least eight months. The result, however, is disappointing. Instead of attempting to give a fair portrayal of The Epoch Times as an up-and-coming media outlet, Roose resorts to factual errors, innuendo, and misrepresentations in an attempt to smear a competing media outlet.

"President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday that will allow Medicaid funds to be used to facilitate travel for women seeking abortions in states where the procedure is still legal, likely violating the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the federal financing of abortion.
The order will assist the acquisition of “reproductive health care for women who live in states where abortions are banned,” Biden said at the first meeting of the Interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access on Wednesday. He claimed it also “advances research and data collection to evaluate the impact..."
"Washingtons fiscal problem can be succinctly summarized: Its the spending, Stupid. For anyone still doubting, you need look no further than the Congressional Budget Offices just-released estimates for the next decade. The verdict: Federal outlays spiked with the recession, remained high and will rise from there Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even with their recent hike, revenues simply cannot keep pace."
"The United States has postponed a scheduled test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to avoid increasing tensions with China as the Asian superpower flexes its military muscle around Taiwan following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby confirmed Thursday that the test would be delayed for “a short period of time.”
“As China engages in destabilizing military exercises around Taiwan, the United States is demonstrating, instead, the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation,” Kirby told..."
"Just before 7 p.m. on Monday, the House of Representatives' impeachment managers will march an article accusing former President Donald Trump of inciting an insurrection across to the Senate side of the Capitol, officially triggering a trial of the former president that could result in him being barred from holding office in the future.
That outcome appears unlikely with more and more Republican senators coming out to say they are against holding an impeachment trial in the first place -- citing the fact that Trump has already left office...."
"Senior US officials failed to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan throughout the 18-year campaign — and hid “unmistakable evidence” that it was unwinnable, according to a damning report by the Washington Post.
The paper, which obtained a cache of government documents under the Freedom of Information Act after a three-year legal battle, reported that the American officials made “rosy pronouncements they knew to be false” about the longest armed conflict in US history.
The trove includes over 2,000 pages of previously unpublished notes of interviews with people..."
"Sen. Marco Rubio on Friday attacked GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump as a “con artist” who has spent much of his life sticking it to the “little guy” and that the United States is on the brink of turning over the nuclear codes to an “erratic individual.”

"In a devastatingly critical report, a World Anti-Doping Agency panel accused Russia on Monday of complicity in widespread doping and cover-ups by track and field athletes during last year's Winter Olympics and other major events, and said they should all be banned from competition until the country cleans up its act."
"Former Vice President Mike Pence is squaring off Tuesday against his old boss, President Trump, in a proxy battle of their endorsed rival candidates in Wisconsin’s gubernatorial Republican primary.
Mr. Pence is backing former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, and Mr. Trump has endorsed construction company owner Tim Michels. An Emerson College poll last week showed Ms. Kleefisch with a 2 percentage point lead — a statistical tie. 
Wisconsin is a battleground state that will likely play an important role again in the 2024 presidential election. Mr. Trump, who is weighing a third run..."

"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump escalated his war with Fox News during a Friday evening appearance on CNN, hurling a shock insult at Megyn Kelly.
After Trump said he has “no respect” for Kelly and contended that she is “highly overrated,” he took one more jab at her.

"Rather than pay for maternity leave, a laundry list of woke U.S. corporations (who until recently flaunted Pride-themed logos) are cutting costs by offering chump change so their pregnant employees can travel across state lines to abort their babies. Just so the female laborer can get back to work on Monday and continue to slave away in the warehouse or clock in at her 6'x6' cubicle—all while the rich get richer. Hurray for women's empowerment?
Aside from the anti-family position, corporate America is painting the baby-killing procedure as ""healthcare"" and ""a human..."
"Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Monday he would veto a bill that would have banned transgender surgery for minors.
Hutchinson made the announcement to reporters, describing the bill as a “vast government overreach,” and said that the state shouldn’t jump into every “medical, human, and ethical issue.” “I was told this week that the nation is looking at Arkansas because I have on my desk another bill passed by the General Assembly that is a product of the cultural war in America,” Hutchinson began. “I don’t shy away from..."

"The White House once again refused to specify when President Donald Trump last tested negative for coronavirus Wednesday, following days of reporters seeking clarification on the president’s COVID-19 timeline.
Trump first announced he had contracted coronavirus at 1 a.m. Friday, but the timeline offered by the president’s team of physicians this weekend implied Trump may have received a positive test result sometime on Thursday, before attending certain campaign events.

"The Biden administration is discussing paying out hundreds of millions of dollars to illegal immigrant families who were separated at the US-Mexico border under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy in 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
According to the Journal, the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services are considering the payments in order to settle lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of families who crossed into the US from Mexico illegally to seek asylum.
The paper reports that the average demand in each lawsuit..."
"There’s inflation and then there’s shrinkflation.
Inflation is easy to spot: The product you bought last month now costs a dime more.
But shrinkflation is much more nefarious. The product you bought last month is the same price — the package may even appear to be the same size — but there’s less of it. In some cases, a good bit less.

"To paraphrase an irate Dennis Green, the administration's Benghazi talking points were what we thought they were, based on multiple previous reports. ABC News pores through the 100-page tranche of emails the White House finally released last night and discovers that the documents do not represent the exculpatory information some administration defenders may have hoped:"
"President Biden was caught insulting Fox News reporter Peter Doocy on Monday for asking if he believes inflation is a “political liability” in the midterms.
“That’s a great asset — more inflation,” Biden responded on a hot mic. “What a stupid son of a b****.”
Biden’s comment comes weeks after a Labor Department report showed inflation increased at the fastest rate in 40 years over the last twelve months. The report showed that the consumer price index, a major inflation gauge, for all items surged 0.5 percent in December and 7.0 percent for..."
"Arkansas lawmakers on Tuesday approved a religious-freedom bill similar to the one recently passed in Indiana that critics say creates the potential for businesses and others to legally discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation.
The state’s Republican-led House gave final approval to the bill, which prohibits the state and local governments from infringing on a person's religious beliefs without a ""compelling"" interest.
The measure now goes to Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has said he will sign it into law."
"If President Joe Biden came out forcefully on the side of increasing US oil production, the price of a barrel could fall quickly, experts told The Post — even if it takes a while to bring that new energy online.
Just look at what happened Wednesday in the wake of the United Arab Emirates and Iraq saying they’d up production by an estimated 800,000 barrels a day: The global price of oil dropped by $22 a barrel within minutes.

"Many Americans will vote along party lines Tuesday, but crucial races could be decided by folks who pick a governor from one party and a Senate contender from the opposing party.
It’s known as “ticket-splitting.” Once seen as a dying trend in U.S. politics, it is expected to make a comeback.
A recent Emerson College Polling/The Hill survey in Pennsylvania found that about 9% of those supporting Democrat Josh Shapiro for governor plan to split their ticket and support Mehmet Oz, a Republican, for Senate.
Mr. Shapiro’s Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, has struggled in his campaign and..."

"While a number of world leaders lined up to criticize a leaked draft opinion that suggests the Supreme Court is considering overturning a landmark case that legalized abortion, some represent countries that have even more restrictions on abortion than those at issue in the arguments before the court.
The United States is an outlier in the permissibility of its abortion laws in some states.
Few countries allow abortion as late into pregnancy as the U.S. does, and many countries require a woman to produce a reason, such as financial hardship or mental distress, to obtain..."
"President Joe Biden unveiled a new effort this week to lower gas prices by increasing reliance on ethanol until the fall, touting it as a way to fight inflation despite indications that the move will have a minimal impact on most people.
“I’m doing everything within my power by executive orders to bring down prices and address the Putin price hikes,” Biden said Tuesday at an event in Iowa, continuing to blame prices that began rising months ago on Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine.

The poll shows that 49 percent of likely voters said they planned to vote for a Republican to represent them in Congress on Nov. 8, compared with 45 percent who planned to vote for a Democrat. The result represents an improvement for Republicans since September, when Democrats held a one-point edge among likely voters in the last Times/Siena poll.

"The images of police in riot gear armed with heavy weaponry and tanks has at times become the alarming backdrop for the Ferguson story, with pictures that television can’t resist.
In these kinds of tinderbox situations, the right generally lines up behind the police and the left pounces on the police state.

"Senate Republicans said Tuesday they are looking to ""revisit"" a law that allows presidents to use the National Emergencies Act to redirect federal funding, as President Trump is proposing to do to build a southern border wall.
The GOP hopes a promise to take up legislation reining in the president will keep fewer Republicans from voting with Democrats this week on a resolution to revoke Trump’s border emergency.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said GOP lawmakers are in discussions to narrow the law after Trump used it to redirect $3.6..."

"America may well get another Bush-Clinton race once this whole presidential thing shakes out, with predictable groans about royal families and political retreads.
But in looking at the coverage this past week, I was struck by this thought: This is one weak pair of front-runners.
Jeb is losing to a guy who’s never run for public office and is in hot water over comments about Mexican immigrants. In short, he’s been Trumped. (Though maybe The Donald has trumped himself by making light of John McCain’s Vietnam captivity, not that the..."

"Big Oil has been the go-to boogeyman for President Biden and Democrats over alleged “price gouging,” with “Putin’s price hike” a close runner-up.
But profits made by the oil industry — while at record levels — ebb and flow with global energy markets, not because the firms are manipulating costs, according to market analysts.
“It’s just political posturing and pandering,” Ed Hirs, an energy economics professor at the University of Houston, said of the president’s anti-corporate rhetoric. “If the focus is just making profits, when is [Mr. Biden] going to turn his guns on Apple?”..."

"The number of new applications for unemployment benefits climbed 18,000 last week to 206,000, more than anticipated.
While Thursday's numbers, reported by the Labor Department, were higher than anticipated, they still reflect a general downward trajectory of new claims throughout the year. Claims were consistently above 600,000 each week earlier this year. Initial jobless claims, which are watched closely by government officials and investors because they are a proxy for layoffs, have dropped as the labor market has improved and fewer people require economic assistance from the government.

"Sixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg from Sweden is the new face of the environmentalist movement, thanks to a pair of impassioned speeches to the U.S. Congress and the United Nations.
But while personalizing a movement, especially with the innocent face of a child, is usually PR gold, Greta’s ascendancy to the forefront of environmental activism could end up being a major negative to the movement – and the environment."
"Yes, it's true. Those awful orange shirts are back. Today, Texan pro-abortion activists are flooding the capitol for the second federal challenge to House Bill 2, the pro-life legislation enacted last year.

"Three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalized in November 2019, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report.
The report goes beyond a State Department fact sheet issued during the final days of former President Donald Trump's administration, which said the staffers became sick in autumn 2019 ""with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illness,"" the Wall Street Journal reported.
Intelligence officials differed on the degree of evidence supporting the report's credibility, with one unidentified official telling the outlet the claims required further substantiation while another described the..."
"Court documents obtained by news website Monday night reveal that approximately 55,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails won’t be released by the State Department to the public in the near future.

"Iran announced it would no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium in what could be the final blow to the country's 2015 nuclear deal.
According to Iranian state TV, the Iranian government said Sunday that the country would not comply with any elements of the unraveling 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which was negotiated by the Obama administration. The announcement, which came after President Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Thursday, raised concerns that the nation will move toward creating..."
"Congressional Republicans are spearheading legislation that will officially mark the end of coronavirus restrictions in America by prohibiting all federally funded entities from imposing mask mandates and requiring proof of vaccination, according to a copy of the bill obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.
The America Reopens Act—introduced on Thursday by Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R., Fla) and three other Florida Republicans—would halt all federal-level COVID restrictions, including the transportation mask mandate, such as those in effect for air travel. Any entity that receives federal funding would also be prohibited from requiring proof..."
"The White House confirmed that President Joe Biden has waived executive privilege on an initial set of documents produced at the request of the Jan. 6 committee.
“The president has determined an assertion of executive privilege isn’t warranted for the first set of documents from the Trump White House that have been provided to us by the National Archives,” press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday."
"In the Biden administration's latest attempt to prevent former President Donald Trump from taking another run at the presidency, the Department of Justice is now investigating Trump's conversations and phone records surrounding his claim that the 2020 election should have gone in his favor, as part of a criminal probe. This is separate from the January 6 Committee's efforts.
Witnesses who are being questioned before a grand jury, including aides to former Vice President Mike Pence, have been asked about conversations and communications between then-President Trump and those close to him who were investigating..."
"CEO confidence in the U.S. economy is waning as survey results and comments from top executives suggest a dim outlook.
The Conference Board’s second-quarter measurement of CEO sentiment revealed that 57 percent anticipate the economy to go through a “very short, mild recession.” This represented the fourth consecutive quarter of declining expectations.
According to the business research group’s regular survey, 61 percent of CEOs noted that general economic conditions were worse compared to six months ago, while 37 percent stated that conditions in their own industries were worse.
“CEO confidence weakened further in the..."
"The world has never been in a better position to end the COVID-19 pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, urging nations to keep up their efforts against the virus that has killed over six million people.
""We are not there yet. But the end is in sight,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a virtual press conference.
The comment was the most optimistic from the UN agency since it declared COVID-19 an international emergency and started describing the virus as a pandemic in..."
"It’s Election Day once again in the U.S. As millions of Americans head to the polls, here are eight races to watch throughout the day.
1. Michigan Governor Race: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vs. Tudor Dixon 
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, is facing Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in Tuesday’s gubernatorial election. 
Whitmer won the governorship in 2018 after defeating Republican state Attorney General Bill Schuette with 53.3% of the vote, CNN reported.

"President Biden on Monday held a moment of silence for the 500,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19 after the US passed what he called the “truly grim, heartbreaking milestone.”
His address was largely aimed at the families that have suffered loss in his 6 p.m. televised speech from the White House. Afterward he hosted a candlelit outdoor commemoration with first lady Jill, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff.
“500,071 dead. That’s more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War..."
"The Republican National Convention will no longer hold events in Jacksonville, Fla., President Trump said Thursday, citing a coronavirus “flare-up” in the city.
“I looked at my team and I said the timing for this event is not right,” he said Thursday during a White House coronavirus briefing. “With what’s happened recently, the flare-up in Florida, to have a big convention, it’s not the right time.”
Delegates will still meet in Charlotte, North Carolina as planned, Trump said, but events in Jacksonville, including his nomination acceptance speech, will no longer..."
"Led by a surge in Hispanic voters, President Obamas campaign said Thursday Democrats are leading the party registration battle in nearly every battleground state this fall as they try to combat disillusionment among Democrats following last weeks debate with GOP nominee Mitt Romney.
The Obama campaign also said that with the exception of Colorado, Democrats are doing better this year versus 2008 in every battleground state that allows voting by mail.
“At this point in 2008, Republicans had an absentee ballot request advantage of 259,000 ballot requests in..."
"Transgender people saw two major breaks in federal court cases Monday over health care access and the ability to play in women’s sports.
A federal court in New York halted the Trump administration’s move to roll back health care protections under the Affordable Care Act for transgender people, while another federal court in Idaho issued an injunction against a state law banning transgender women from women’s sports.
The health-care-related injunction issued by Judge Frederic Block, a Clinton appointee, reasoned President Trump’s administration couldn’t change part of the Affordable Care Act..."
"His standing with veterans damaged by scandal, President Barack Obama on Tuesday defended his administration's response to Veterans Affairs lapses that delayed health care for thousands of former service members, but conceded more needed to be done to regain their trust.
His appearance also had deep political overtones in a state where the Democratic senator, Kay Hagan, is facing a difficult re-election and has sought to distance herself from Obama's policies, declaring as recently as Friday that his administration had not ""done enough to earn the lasting trust of our..."
"Sen. Ted Cruz on Sunday doubled down on his call to arms in “defunding Obamacare,” even if Senate Democrats are highly unlikely to approve any short-term spending deal this September that impugns President Obama’s signature domestic achievement.
Mr. Cruz, Texas Republican, said that if the GOP-controlled House could pass a continuing resolution that strips the Affordable Care Act of funding this September, a “grass-roots tsunami” of opposition to the health care law could force the Senate to relent."
"Democratic solidarity on COVID-19 policy is beginning to break.
President Joe Biden laid out his administration’s response to the Omicron variant last week as new cases surge in many parts of the country and some Americans panic about an uncertain future. But unlike during previous waves, more and more Democrats are saying no to new lockdowns and mandates to stop the spread.
New York has been one of the most restrictive states in the country at various points in the pandemic, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul appears to be drawing..."
"The president-elect of Iran insisted he would not meet with President Joe Biden, whose administration seeks to reinstate the nuclear agreement with the nation that was signed during the Obama administration and revoked by President Donald Trump.
Ebrahim Raisi, formerly the chief of Iran’s judiciary, said on Monday that he is unwilling to negotiate over the proliferation of his country’s nuclear weapons program, something the United States and close regional ally Israel seek to slow, and urged the U.S. to ease pressures imposed on top officials and the Iranian economy.
“The U.S. is obliged to..."
"China's civilian aviation authority has ordered all Chinese airlines to temporarily ground their Boeing 737 Max 8 planes after one of the aircraft crashed in Ethiopia.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the order is to take effect by 6 p.m. Monday.
It said the order was taken out of safety concerns because the Ethiopian crash was the second in similar circumstances since an Indonesian crash in October also killed everyone aboard.
It said further notice would be issued after consultation with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing..."
"Twelve people were killed and four others were injured when a gunman opened fire at the Virginia Beach, Virginia, municipal center on Friday afternoon, officials said.
Responding officers shot and killed the gunman, said Virginia Beach Police Chief James A. Cervera. One officer was injured and was expected to recover.
“He was saved by his vest,” the chief told reporters."
"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law Thursday and announced the country had severed diplomatic ties with Russia after the giant neighboring nation launched a military invasion into Ukraine.
Beijing on Thursday refused to criticize Russia's attack on Ukraine, instead calling for a diplomatic solution. China also approved the importation of Russian wheat, a move that could blunt the effects of sanctions levied on the Kremlin.

"Chris Christie brought the tough love, the swagger, the fight -- and even the Boss -- to Tampa Tuesday night.
The straight-talking New Jersey governor used his highly anticipated convention keynote to strike a match under the Republican Party faithful and effectively give them their marching orders going into November. Making the case in no uncertain terms for the Romney ticket, Christie charged conservatives with leading a “new era of truth-telling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ calling this the only way to revive a country “paralyzed by feckless leadership."
"Looking back at our popular culture in 2014, it appears that Hollywood's power is on the wane. Politically, the leftist celebrities and the ""Rock the Vote"" gang couldn't help dig the Democrats out of their rut. Even that paragon of permissiveness Sandra Fluke couldn't exploit her Limbaugh-victim aura to win a state Senate seat in libertine California"
"More than 50,000 Americans have been killed by the coronavirus, according to data posted online by Johns Hopkins University on Friday.
Of the 50,031 victims, nearly one-third — 16,388 — died in New York City, the statistics show.
The national death toll is five times the milestone of 10,000 hit less than three weeks ago and puts COVID-19 on track to soon kill more than the 58,000 Americans who died during the Vietnam War."
"The Italian government imposed one of the world’s strictest COVID-19 measures on Friday, requiring all workers in Italy to show a COVID-19 “Green Pass” prior to entering their place of employment.
Starting on Oct. 15, the new rule will make it obligatory for employees to show that they have been vaccinated against the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, which causes COVID-19, before returning to their workplaces. A recent negative test or having recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months is also allowed.
Workers who are not in possession of the so-called Green Pass will..."
"Families of Sandy Hook victims reached a $73 million settlement Tuesday in their lawsuit against Remington Arms, manufacturer of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle used to kill 20 kids and six staff members in the 2012 massacre.
The nine families brought a class-action suit in 2014 against Remington Arms, which made the weapon used in the mass shooting, claiming the gun-maker sought to sell the military-grade weapon to the mentally ill.
Remington had offered the families a $33 million settlement in July 2021, about $3.7 million per family, less than half..."
"Former President Barack Obama momentarily placed the politics of hope to one side on Wednesday as he strove to unite the Democratic Party behind 2020 standard-bearer Joe Biden and against President Trump.
Four years ago, when Obama addressed the 2016 convention in Philadelphia, a Trump presidency was a hypothetical. Now, Obama argued Wednesday, people were dying because of his successor's sloppy record in the White House.
""Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,"" Obama told Democrats. ""And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead,..."
"Much outrage has materialized over President Trump’s use of the term “Chinese virus” to refer to the novel coronavirus pandemic affecting the United States and the world. Critics have condemned the president as “racist” and “xenophobic.”
Certainly, such allegations are not new for the president. Just as in the past, they reveal far more about the biases of the accusers than they do about Trump.
For the past three years, many of the critics calling Trump a racist have repeatedly condemned him of buddying up to authoritarian strongmen such as..."
"A federal court dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, handing the social media giant a victory as it battles claims of unfair monopolistic behavior.
The decision Monday marks a setback for the trade commission and could lead to more aggressive calls for U.S. antitrust law to be updated by Congress, just as related bipartisan bills have been introduced by the House Judiciary Committee.
A Washington, D.C., federal court said the agency was too vague in its complaint and didn't do enough to support its assertion that Facebook had abused its power..."
"The Supreme Court is unlikely to kill Obamacare, as Republicans challenged the legality of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate Tuesday at the high court for the third time in hopes the 6-3 conservative majority would finally do away with President Obama’s signature law.
After the justices ruled the ACA was lawful as a tax in 2012, Republican lawmakers have tried a number of times to repeal and replace the massive health care overhaul, but they’ve repeatedly failed.
In 2017, the GOP majority in Congress implemented tax cuts which put..."
"The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against the FCC's policy regulating curse words and nudity on broadcast television.
In an 8-0 decision, the high court threw out fines and sanctions imposed by the Federal Communications Commission. The case involved some uncensored curse words and brief nudity on various networks, including Fox.
""Because the FCC failed to give FOX or ABC fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent, the Commissions' standards as applied to these broadcasts were..."
"The Supreme Court handed down neither its Obamacare ruling, nor its Arizona immigration law decision today, so we'll have to wait until at least Monday (and possibly later) for those. But since all eyes were on the High Court this morning, one verdict of note was rendered: In the case of Knox v. SEIU, the Court overturned the hard-Left Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- a regular occurrence these days -- and ruled against the SEIU. The decision was a relatively lopsided 7-2 split: Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg sided with..."
"Former President Trump on Monday said that his Mar-A-Lago home in Florida is ""under siege"" by a ""large group"" of FBI agents.
""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will..."
"Two political action committees founded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s top aide funneled over $1 million in political donations into two of his own private companies, according to a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.
The cash transfers from the PACs — overseen by Saikat Chakrabarti, the freshman socialist Democrat's chief of staff — run counter to her pledges to increase transparency and reduce the influence of ""dark money"" in politics.
Chakrabarti's companies appear to have been set up for the sole purpose of obscuring how the political..."
"Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions that African Americans have made throughout history, while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues to this day.
This year's theme for Black History Month is Black Health and Wellness, as outlined by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. 
Many events across the country — in cities, in communities, on college campuses, and more — are scheduled for this month."
"Life expectancy for those born in the United States decreased an average of a whole year amid the coronavirus pandemic, the largest margin since World War II.
According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Thursday, people across the racial and gender barriers in the U.S. experienced a drop in their life expectancy. The CDC describes life expectancy as the “average number of years that a group of infants would live if they were to experience throughout life.”
In 2019, the average life expectancy in the U.S...."
"Going after Disney is the victim’s punch to the nose to correct the bully — stop attacking us, or we will defend ourselves.
Ihave to disagree with my fellow movement conservative Charles C. W. Cooke (and some others, judging from Twitter; namely, Hannah Cox and Brad Polumbo, but I’m sure there are more) about Disney’s smackdown by Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida legislature. It’s pretty indisputable that what gave rise to this effort was Disney’s vocal and unfair opposition to Florida’s parental-rights law, the one that prevented gender and sexuality topics from being taught..."
"Sunday’s White Settlement, Texas, church shooting, which was over in 6 seconds, should have been a lesson to politicians who repeatedly push for more stringent gun control laws.
In the wake of the November 5, 2017, Sutherland Springs Baptist Church shooting that injured 20 and took 27 lives, including those of the shooter and an unborn child, the state of Texas could have followed the lead of most other states.
Because the Sutherland Springs gunman used a Ruger AR-556 to inflict his carnage, Texas could have banned AR-style weapons...."
"A Florida federal judge ruled Thursday that portions of the affidavit underpinning the FBI search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate could likely be made public — despite objections from the Justice Department.
West Palm Beach Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart — who signed off on the search of the 45th president’s home — said at the conclusion of a 90-minute hearing that “I believe — at least on my initial careful review of the affidavit — that there are portions that could be presumptively unsealed.”
Reinhart gave federal prosecutors..."
"The Supreme Court this week continued to disappoint congressional Democrats and activists with a long line of embarrassingly unanimous, nonideological rulings. After all, the court is supposedly (to use President Biden’s words) “out of whack” due to its irreconcilable ideological divisions. Indeed, the court is allegedly so dysfunctionally divided that many, including Democratic leaders, have called for sweeping changes — from packing the court with new justices to changing its voting rules or even creating an alternative court.
That is why these weeks have so frustrated those who insist the court..."
"Let’s call the roll on President Biden’s ideas to reduce high gasoline prices. He’s tried lobbying the Saudis, to no avail. Releasing oil from the U.S. strategic reserve; the market yawned. Attacking oil and gas companies for not drilling or refining enough, but he also wants to put those companies out of business.
Now comes the feeblest effort so far—a White House request on Wednesday that Congress suspend the 18.4 cent a gallon federal gas tax for three months. That’s only long enough to reduce the irritation of drivers, er,..."
"President Joe Biden is reportedly coming down on the price tag on an infrastructure package in hopes of coming to a bipartisan compromise with a group of Republican senators, but new spending and corporate tax hikes remain sticking points in negotiations.
In about an hourlong meeting with Republican negotiator West Virginia Sen. Shelly Moore Capito on Wednesday, Biden asked for $1 trillion in new spending on top of a baseline of $400 billion over five years, according to CNN and Politico.
That would put Biden's new ask down from his initial $2.3 trillion proposal and the $1.7..."
"The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops elected its first Latino leader Tuesday.
Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, an immigrant from Mexico, has been serving as the UCCB vice president for the past three years, so the win was no surprise.
“I just wanted to be a priest,” Gomez told CNA about his new post. “Somehow God wanted me to do what I am doing, and I’m just counting on the grace of God to be able to be faithful to what God is asking me to do.”
Gomez is considered..."
"Much of the world bade “Sayonara!” to 2020 long before the new year landed in the US — and a subdued Times Square.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage across the globe — no doubt making 2020 one of the worst years on record — here are some countries that ushered in 2021 ahead of us.

"Plenty of people, like ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski, are ""cringing"" over Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' ad that focuses on GOP challenger Greg Abbott and the accident that left him in a wheelchair, but she says she is not pulling the spot down.
The 30-second spot, called ""Justice"" was released on Friday and notes that Abbott received millions of dollars in a lawsuit after he was injured back in 1984, but accuses him of not siding with victims like himself during his time in the state Supreme..."
"The Biden administration insisted on Tuesday that the federal government will not be supporting any initiative to require credentials to prove a person’s COVID-19 vaccination status or a database to keep track of inoculations.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated comments she made at her March 29 press briefing, in which she said that the administration would not push for the use of what have colloquially been referred to as “vaccine passports.”
“Let me be very clear on this. I know there's been lots of questions,” Psaki said during..."

The command posted a picture that showed the island covered in fire, black smoke and the aftermath of heavy missile fire."
"President Obama acknowledged the information released by his administration this morning that an American counterterrorism operation against Al-Qaeda mistakenly killed two innocent hostages.
Information about the operation was released suddenly this morning by the White House, followed by a brief statement delivered personally by Obama.
“It is a cruel and bitter truth that in the fog of war generally and our fight against terrorist specifically, mistakes, sometimes deadly mistakes can occur,” Obama explained in the White House press briefing room.
He said al-Qaeda was hiding the two hostages – one..."
"Russia continues to send military forces to its border with Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Friday, reiterating that an attack could take place at any time — including during the ongoing Winter Olympics.
“Simply put, we continue to see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border,” Blinken told reporters during a news conference in Melbourne following meetings with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan."
"The CEO of the popular e-cigarette company Juul called the nearly 200 cases of vaping-related illnesses “worrisome” — but said his popular products will stay on the market ""until we see some facts.”
Speaking to ""CBS This Morning,"" Kevin Burns addressed the series of vaping-related lung illnesses reported in at least 22 states that have resulted in dozens of hospitalizations and at least one death.
The cases are “worrisome for the category,” Burns told the outlet. “Worrisome for us if we contributed to it.”"
"President Trump on Tuesday told the United Nations that it must hold China accountable for its failure to contain the coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic -- and declared the World Health Organization ""controlled"" by Beijing.
“The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions,” Trump told the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, separately calling the virus ""The China Virus.""
The administration has long blamed Beijing for its botched handling of the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China before becoming a worldwide pandemic, and has called on..."
"Russia has ordered troops to the two separatist regions of Ukraine’s Donbas territory to fulfill “peacekeeping functions,” per an official order from the Kremlin, following Russian president Vladimir Putin’s recognition of their independence Monday.
Prior to Moscow’s decree, published shortly after Putin’s announcement recognizing the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, the Pentagon had anticipated that Russia would invade the two zones by Monday night."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has won the New Hampshire primary, Fox News projects, catapulting the 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist to the front of the still-crowded Democratic presidential primary field.
Sanders had been leading top rival Pete Buttigieg and several other candidates as results came in throughout the evening, though only by a fraction of his 22-point margin of victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary. Buttigieg, meanwhile, touted his strong second-place finish as a sign that his campaign was ""here to stay.""

US Senator Marco Rubio is developing a wide-ranging immigration reform plan Ã¢â‚¬â€ including steps to give more than 12 million illegals currently in the US legal status Ã¢â‚¬â€ in an effort to seize the initiative on a contentious issue that polls show is hurting the Republican Party with the nations rapidly growing Hispanic population.
"If there is one thing that Hollywood elites and the privileged politicians in the Democrat Party have both mastered, it is the art of the fictional narrative. What we saw last week at the Democratic National Convention was just that – a four-day flashy spectacle with no real substance and an entirely unrealistic portrayal of real America.
It felt less like a political convention and more like a Hollywood awards show: out-of-touch, boring and filled with actors heaping praise on one another. Cue the cutoff music.
At this week’s Republican National..."
"Sunrise Movement targets California Democrat with video clip. Democrats who refuse to jump on the Green New Deal bandwagon might find themselves trending on social media — and not in a good way — thanks to the Sunrise Movement.
That’s what happened Friday to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, after she met with a group of children, teens and activists asking her to endorse the sweeping Green New Deal resolution sponsored by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey.
Ms. Feinstein said she could not support the measure, shared..."

Tall Tales about Conservatives and the Supreme Court
Last week Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) voiced the commonly held belief that the Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage across the country was wrongly decided — yet popular Twitter personalities twisted his words to tell a more sinister story.

"Since the Nord Stream gas pipelines located in the Baltic Sea exploded on Tuesday, countries have been quick to point fingers as to who is behind the unusual leaks.
Germany's Nord Stream AG, which operates the pipelines, is conducting tests to assess the damage. The company said in a statement that it cannot provide an estimate for when the gas pipelines' infrastructure will be restored.
While the German-operated company determines a cause, several other European countries are ready to launch an investigation into potential sabotage. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European..."

"U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) rejected offers of federal manpower days before Jan. 6—and they again turned down an offer of federal reinforcements as protestors breached the Capitol building during the formal counting of electoral votes.
Three days before Jan. 6, the Pentagon asked Capitol Police if they needed National Guard manpower, but their offer was turned down by Capitol Police, unnamed senior defense officials told the Associated Press.
And as the building was being stormed, Justice Department leaders reached out to Capitol police and offered to provide them with FBI..."

"YORK Ã¢â‚¬â€ Speaking at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, President Obama portrayed the deaths of four Americans in Libya as a result of inflamed tensions over an anti-Islam movie produced in the U.S., rather than a terrorist attack.
Although his administration in recent days acknowledged that the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others were caused by a terrorist act on Sept. 11, Mr. Obama didnt mention terrorism as the likely cause in front of the international audience. He focused much of his speech..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday brought an abrupt end to a long-shot lawsuit filed by Texas and backed by President Donald Trump seeking to throw out voting results in four states, dealing him a crushing setback in his quest to undo his election loss to Joe Biden.

"Bill Clintons typically epic speech last night was certainly the most detailed, calculated and complete attack on the Republican agenda that we have heard during the entire campaign. It was also the most unreserved and embracing defense of President Obama.

"The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge accelerated more than expected in June, according to new data released on Friday, a worrisome sign as central bankers try to combat higher prices with the steepest interest rate hikes in decades. 
The personal consumption expenditures index showed that core prices, which strips out the more volatile measurements of food and energy, climbed 0.6% from the previous month and rose 4.8% on an annual basis, according to the Commerce Department. Those figures are both higher than the 0.5% monthly increase and 4.7% annual increase forecast by..."

The new target raises the fleet average fuel economy requirement by 25% from 32 mpg to 40 mpg, according to Reuters. President Biden had previously proposed a 38 mpg requirement in August and has encouraged automakers to transition their lineups to 50% electric vehicles by 2030.

"President Donald Trump announced Sunday morning from the White House that U.S. forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called “Islamic State,” or ISIS, saying Baghdadi had “died like a dog,” and had been “whimpering, and crying, and screaming all the way.”
Trump’s unusual vivid description of the battle at Baghdadi’s hideout — in which no U.S. or allied personnel were killed or even injured — sought to portray Baghdadi as a coward who “died like a dog,” evil to the very last."
"Oakland County, Mich., prosecutor Karen McDonald announced involuntary manslaughter charges on Friday for the parents of the high school sophomore who allegedly killed four students and wounded seven other people in a shooting at Oxford High School on Tuesday.

"Amid increased brinksmanship with the United States, Iran announced Monday its intention to exceed the low-enriched uranium stockpile limit it agreed to in the 2015 nuke deal -- unless certain demands are met by the pact's remaining signatories within the next 10 days.
More provocatively, the Islamic Republic's Atomic Energy Organization spokesman warned Iran could enrich uranium up to 20 percent -- just a step below weapons-grade level.

It is a welcome shift from his earlier partisanship-addled refusal, but the process it took to reach this decision is not one that inspires confidence.

"With the recent mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas that left 20-plus people dead and scores more wounded, there’s nothing more startling to the public, and especially the police, than an armed man armed with a rifle in the vicinity of…a Walmart.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “is preparing a detailed Senate request” for the money, a top aide told the Washington Examiner.
“Expect Schumer’s request to be finalized this morning and sent to appropriators,” the aide said.

"With its announcement on Friday of new 5-10% tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods, China is escalating pressure on President Trump. Xi Jinping senses that Trump is increasingly desperate for a trade deal. He believes he can cajole Trump into making a more China-friendly trade deal.
Trump's response on Friday has been mixed.
While his latest attack on Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell — questioning whether Powell is more of an enemy than Xi Jinping — is idiotic, Trump is right to point out the central threat of Chinese..."
"I guess I’ve put off my election predictions for as long as I can. I usually prefer to hold off until right before Election Day, because you never know when some October surprise — or more accurately, a November surprise — will come along and change the dynamic, or give those last few undecided voters a reason to break a certain way.
But I think one of the big stories of the 2022 midterms is how much the dynamics didn’t change. This looked like a big GOP wave year back in the..."
"President Obama and Tim Kaine tag-teamed to deliver a scorching warm-up Wednesday for Hillary Clinton to accept the party’s nomination for president at the Democratic convention, with the president accusing Republican Donald Trump of only offering “slogans” and “fear” – and Clinton’s newly tapped running mate almost upstaging the commander-in-chief with his gusty impression of the billionaire’s New Yawk bravado."
"Inflation cooled on an annual basis for the first time in months in April, but rose more than expected as supply chain constraints, the Russian war in Ukraine and strong consumer demand continued to keep consumer prices running near a 40-year-high. 
The Labor Department said Wednesday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 8.3% in April from a year ago, below the 8.5% year-over-year surge recorded in March.

Biden's 52% approval is much higher than Trump's 42%, but he's also received much more positive media coverage than Donald Trump. And while his handling of the Covid pandemic has the approval of 64% of Americans his handling of the border crisis has the disapproval of 53%.

"On January 6, 2021, Mike Pence presided over a constitutionally mandated joint session of Congress to count the electoral votes. The Trump-Pence campaign disputed the 2020 results in election contests and in court, but by January 6, the legal options were exhausted. Each state government sent only a single slate of electors to be counted.
Under our Constitution and laws, nothing remained but to count the votes. Instead, an angry mob descended upon the Capitol to prevent that from happening. This will, and should, be remembered as a stain on the..."
"Democrats had a stronger Election Night than many analysts anticipated, buoyed in part by Trump-endorsed Republican candidates who performed worse than expected. But in six instances—three gubernatorial races, two House races, and one Senate race—Democrats actually participated in the process of selecting those Republican candidates by spending money in their primary campaigns. This cynical bet paid off.
Meddling of this nature isn’t unprecedented—in 2012, for instance, Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill’s campaign boosted Todd Akin in the Republican primary before beating him in the general election. But many of the..."

The average start time for high schools across the state prior to..."
"The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly increased last week as a relentless surge in new COVID-19 infections hobbled business operations, offering more evidence that the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession was faltering.

"The Trump administration told a federal appeals court Monday it thinks all of Obamacare is unconstitutional, marking an escalation in its fight against the 2010 law.
Justice Department lawyers previously had argued that if the courts found Obamacare’s “individual mandate” is no longer constitutional, then a narrow slice of the program — consumer protections for people with pre-existing conditions — could not stand, either.
A federal judge in Texas went much further in a December ruling, agreeing with plaintiff states who said the whole law should be invalidated. On Monday,..."
"The Washington Post made a massive correction Monday to a January report about a phone call between then-President Donald Trump and a Georgia elections investigator, as the liberal paper admitted multiple quotes attributed to Trump based on an anonymous source were inaccurate.

"One feature of our current politics is how quickly bad events trigger a rush to bad policies. So it is that the response to the killing of George Floyd has sprinted past police reform to “defund the police.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to redirect $150 million from public safety to social programs, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was hooted from a protest on the weekend because he admitted he didn’t want to defund the police. City Council members now pledge to dismantle the force whether he wants to..."

Mr. Craig is accused of lying to Justice Department officials about Manafort’s lobbying work for the Ukrainian government. The former White House counsel has pleaded not guilty to the charge, which was born out of Mr. Mueller’s investigation.
Although Mr. Mueller referred the case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia,..."
"With as many times as outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid mentioned the Koch brothers in Senate floor speeches this year, you'd think that they were the ones who spent the most money during the 2014 midterm elections. Think again. Out of all the billionaires who donated money to causes or campaigns for the midterms, the top two were Democrats and they outspent everyone else on the list, combined. David Koch isn't even near the top."
"Former president Donald Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN on Monday, seeking over $475 million in damages.
According to the lawsuit, the media company has used “its massive influence — purportedly as a ‘trusted’ news source — to defame the Plaintiff in the minds of its viewers and readers for the purpose of defeating him politically.” Trump also claims that CNN’s negative coverage contributed to his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.
Trump had announced his intent to take legal action against CNN for its allegedly defamatory descriptions of him in..."

The list was released per an order from Florida federal Judge Aileen M. Cannon, as she weighs whether to appoint a ""special master"" to check the documents for..."
"The announcement of Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement has whistled the start of that Washington blood sport known as a Supreme Court confirmation. While the filibuster-free process guarantees President Joe Biden that he has the votes to pick anyone acceptable to all Senate Democrats, this fight is different from any in history in one respect. As a candidate, Mr. Biden pledged to select the next justice first and foremost on race and sex.

The study was posted ahead of next week’s public meeting with a panel of outside expert advisers who will meet on Tuesday to advise the agency before it decides whether or not..."
America’s top intelligence official acknowledged Tuesday that President Obama and other senior White House officials were well aware of U.S. surveillance activities targeting leaders of friendly foreign nations — a stark contradiction of the administration’s insinuation in recent days that the president was unaware of such spying.
"The January 6 Committee investigating the Capitol Riot is discussing whether it will call on former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence to interview with the committee, a Republican member of the committee said.

"After two days of intense criticism, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden reversed course Thursday and declared that he no longer supports a long-standing congressional ban on using federal health care money to pay for abortions.
Biden's reversal came after rivals and women's rights groups blasted him for affirming through his campaign aides that he still supported the Hyde Amendment. With the shift, Biden hopes to limit any damage from women's groups and progressives who already are skeptical about whether a 76-year-old, more centrist white man can be the party standard-bearer..."
"The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from former President Donald Trump to block the January 6 Committee’s access to his White House’s records in the National Archives on Thursday.
The House Select Committee on January 6 is tasked with investigating the events before, during and after the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The injunction is temporary, however, and only blocks the documents from being released while the larger legal question of whether the committee can legally access the documents is litigated.

""The court holds that partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote.

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo is lucky he’s a Democrat — otherwise Lindsey Boylan’s charge that he “sexually harassed” her might lead to political challenges and media shame.
“Yes, @NYGovCuomo sexually harassed me for years. Many saw it, and watched,” the former Cuomo aide, now running for Manhattan beep, tweeted.
It’s a serious charge, one Cuomo flatly denies. The details? Boylan won’t say. She cites no specific allegations and provides no evidence. She won’t even respond to requests for further comment. “I have no interest in talking to journalists,” she declares. “I..."

"The New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize-nominated podcast about ISIS was an “institutional failure” that included shoddy reporting based off interviews with a “con artist,” executive editor Dean Baquet said Friday.
In a blistering editors’ note, the newspaper said the 2018 series “Caliphate” blew its journalistic standards.

"If you've been following the judicial confirmation wars of recent years, you're already aware that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly taken off the gloves, forcing Democrats to live by the hardball partisan rules they've established over the course of numerous ends-driven power grabs. He detonated Harry Reid's nuclear option after the minority party launched an unprecedented filibuster against Justice Gorsuch's nomination, and has subsequently trimmed and stymied other delay tactics, as Democrats have adjusted their approach to across-the-board resistance. With some Democrats already fuming over the current consequences..."
"With the decision by Britain's High Court that Julian Assange can be extradited to the United States, his high-profile case appears, at long last, to be coming to some sort of unfortunate end. Assange's fate will soon be in the hands of the U.S. federal courts, and it seems unlikely that either he or freedom of the press will emerge unscathed from the ordeal.
In a decision that heavily relies on the British government's history of believing official U.S. assurances, the High Court took on face value American claims that Assange will not be..."
The presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov.

"Jonathan Adler wonders whom Adam Schiff thinks his audience is. The answer is simple: the media.
The same people who spent years passing along every falsehood and selective leak the California congressman gave them to fuel the Russia-collusion hysteria, and the same people who still accept his allegations — knowing his long history of fabrications — without much skepticism, spent yesterday pretending that Schiff was a modern-day Cicero.
All of it was about believable as Schiff’s contention that he is pursuing impeachment to defend the Constitution. But we expect partisans..."

"Joe Biden has been wrong about most major foreign-policy questions all of his adult life, but — as a long-time senator and then vice president — didn’t have much power to do anything about it.
That’s no longer the case, and we are now seeing the gut-wrenching consequences in Afghanistan, where Biden rejected the advice of his military and intelligence officials and ignored the clear evidence on the ground, and ordered a calamitous U.S. withdrawal.
Despite the president’s fantastical assurances a little over a month ago that Afghan security forces had the..."

"There are tons of valid questions about the legality and the mechanism of this supposed suspension, and like many tweeted promises of Trump, this might never really happen.
Here’s my question: Given how fiercely Trump has always spoken about the threats from immigration, why did he not take earlier and stronger steps to close our borders and limit foreign travel into the country?
Yes, he issued a “travel ban” on China shortly after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. But that has been porous. Reportedly,..."
"The New York Times reported on Thursday that ""intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected.""
I'm not convinced that gives full context to the briefing. I suspect a Democratic member asked a briefer something along the lines of, ""Do you assess that Russia is trying to reelect Trump?"" The briefer then probably offered a hedged response in the affirmative. I believe the core of the briefing was likely situated around an assessment that Russia is..."

"Taking note of a supposed ""spike"" in harassment and intimidating behavior directed at public school officials, Attorney General Merrick Garland has instructed the FBI to be on the lookout for angry parents demanding accountability at school board meetings.
On Monday, Garland sent a memo to the federal law enforcement agency directing it to coordinate with the nation's 14,000 school districts. This action comes after the Biden administration received a plea from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) to protect schools from the ""imminent threat"" of parents sending ""threatening letters and cyberbullying"" school..."
"In an official memo, Attorney General Merrick Garland has pledged to mobilize the FBI against parents protesting critical race theory in public schools, citing unspecified “threats of violence” against school officials.
Garland’s memo follows a National School Boards Association request that the Biden administration investigate threats to school board members and classify sometimes-heated parent protests as “domestic terrorism.” The NSBA suggested that some of these parents should be prosecuted under the PATRIOT Act and federal hate-crimes legislation.
The school board association letter, however, is riddled with falsehoods, errors, and exaggerations...."
"Homebuilder pessimism has deepened as confidence in the U.S. housing market continues its downward spiral amid skyrocketing mortgage rates and inflation.

"President Biden, who tripped Friday while boarding Air Force One, drew scrutiny from conservatives who pointed out he once mocked former President Donald Trump’s slow walk down a ramp during a trip to West Point.

Trump critics, including the Lincoln Project, later used the footage in social media posts and ads questioning his fitness.

"The night the Russian attack on Ukraine started, Michael observed, “strikes me that this is the first time we’re really seeing air power live on television that isn’t our own.” Indeed, watching the flying Russian missiles, helicopters, jet fighters, and columns of advancing Russian tanks – and sympathizing with the Ukrainians – generates different feelings than listening to Bernard Shaw and Peter Arnett describe the aerial attack on Baghdad on 1991.
Similarly, this is the first time since the end of the Cold War that the U.S. response is constrained by the..."

The move comes as part of a convoluted deal struck by congressional leaders of both parties to allow a one-time solution to avoid federal default by letting Democrats lift the debt limit.

Forty thousand lives, if people act responsibly,” Biden said last month. “Let’s institute a mask mandate nationwide starting immediately,..."
"Add this to the list of Reasons Not To Vote For Joe Biden: He no longer thinks a national mask mandate would be a good idea. It’s not that he thinks national mask mandates are wrong. It’s that he ever thought national mask mandates could ever fly in the first place.

"It was gospel among the GOP consultant class for many years: Either conservatives pander to Hispanics by supporting more immigration and amnesty for illegal aliens, or their share of the Hispanic vote would continue to shrink. Then along came Trump, the man who made his political career and presidency from statements and promises that violated every piece of advice in the GOP pandering and sensitivity training handbook.

"After yesterday’s Coronavirus Task Force press briefing, the media quickly seized on a discussion over potential treatments for the coronavirus COVID-19 where the president asked about the potential for a disinfectant injection.
“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?” The President said. “So it’d be interesting to check that.”

"President Trump in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday night demanded that lawmakers amend the coronavirus stimulus package they passed Monday to include $2,000 checks for individuals instead of $600 checks -- while also insisting that ""wasteful and unnecessary"" items be cut from the year-end spending package that was attached to the pandemic aid.
The president, meanwhile, doubled down on his baseless claims that he won the presidential election in a ""magnificent landslide"" and attacked the two most powerful Republicans in the U.S. Senate because they've acknowledged that President-elect..."

"Derek Chauvin's murder conviction was met with widespread approval among those seeking justice for George Floyd, but the trial's outcome may not be set in stone thanks to remarks from influential political leaders such as Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and President Biden himself.
Waters, who had visited Minnesota before the verdict was announced, said that if Chauvin is not convicted of murder, protesters should ""stay in the street,"" ""get more active,"" and ""get more confrontational.""

"Matthew McConaughey’s speech at the White House on Tuesday was strikingly different from the usual “Hollywood star lectures America” dribble: This was humble, moving and truly personal.

"The most interesting public-health development of the pandemic era came this week with a radical course revision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The policy change has COVID hawks trembling with fear and rage and bafflement — while those who believe we need to find a way to move on from top-down regulatory measures are very confused by the possibility the CDC just became an ally rather than an enemy.
Simply put, the CDC appears to have decided that there’s just too much COVID around now to continue its previously draconian..."
"If you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you don’t need a booster shot to protect against the Delta variant, the US government says.

"The U.S. economy grew at a record-breaking 33.1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, beating forecasters' expectations.
The massive growth number, although not enough to return the economy to pre-pandemic health, will provide President Trump to claim in the last days of the election that the country is clawing its way out of the COVID-19 recession faster than critics thought possible.
""This record economic growth is absolute validation of President Trump’s policies which create jobs and opportunities for Americans in every corner of the country,""..."

"Just as talks between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping signaled a cooling of a trade war between the US and China, the arrest of Meng Wanzhou in a Vancouver airport might signal a new round of hardball. Ostensibly, the detention and potential extradition of the daughter of Chinese telecom Huawei’s founder and its chief financial officer relates to US suspicions that Huawei has violated sanctions against Iran. That would make for a stunning coincidence, however:"
"Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., on Wednesday signaled that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy may hit a few speed bumps on his quest to become the next House speaker, arguing the Republican conference needs to have ""a serious discussion"" about leadership after Tuesday's disappointing election results.

"President Obama's approach to so-called ""climate change"" appears to include recycling old ideas.
In his State of the Union address, the president recycled the idea of spending more on education, though we are still getting unsatisfactory results.

"Douglas E. Schoen’s Perspective: On Monday President Obama delivered a defense of his administration's response to the Benghazi attacks: he said that nothing new came out in last week's hearings, that he called the Benghazi attack what it was — a terror attack — the day after it happened, and furthermore, that the controversy over the edited talking points is a political sideshow, rooted in partisan motivations.
But the president can't just dismiss the questions over what exactly happened in Benghazi."

"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders scored big victories in Wisconsin's presidential primaries Tuesday, dampening Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's hopes of wrapping up the race any time soon -- and putting heavy pressure on the front-runners to recapture the momentum in contests later this month."
"The Jan. 6 select committee tasked with investigating the deadly attack at the Capitol is calling for a trio of House Republicans to cooperate voluntarily with its investigation, according to letters sent to the lawmakers on Monday.
The panel, probing the Capitol riots in which supporters of defeated President Donald Trump tried to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 victory, wants cooperation from GOP Reps. Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks, and Ronny Jackson.

"The Supreme Court on Monday allowed a Kentucky abortion law to stand that requires an abortionist to perform an ultrasound and describe the image to the mother and allow her to hear the heartbeat of the fetus before terminating it.

Democrats tried to turn their attention Monday night from an email scandal that claimed their party chairwoman and sent Bernie Sanders supporters into near rebellion with a scorching attack on Donald Trump that ranged from unnamed references by Michelle Obama to in-your-face attacks by Elizabeth Warren and Sanders himself.
"A federal judge dismissed former President Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and a number of other high-profile figures involved in creating the narrative that he and his 2016 presidential campaign were colluding with Russia.
Trump filed the lawsuit in March in the Southern District of Florida, alleging that Clinton and her ""cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot"" and ""maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative"" that Trump was colluding with Russia.
This week, U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks threw out the lawsuit, saying that ""most of"" Trump’s claims were ""unsupported..."
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday said his claim that the Obama administration left no plan for a national pandemic was “wrong” and there was in fact a playbook in place for the Trump administration.
“I was wrong,” McConnell said during a Fox News interview.
“They did leave behind a plan. So I clearly made a mistake in that regard,” the majority leader continued. “As to whether or not the plan was followed and who is the critic and all the rest, I don’t have any observation about that..."
"All along, the biggest question in this election was whether Republicans could take over the Senate and add it to their solid House majority.
Republicans need to gain six net seats to do so. Three, in states where Democrats are retiring, seem nearly certain: West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota.
Republicans' chief targets elsewhere are Democrats running for re-election in states that President Barack Obama lost: Alaska, Louisiana, Arkansas and North Carolina.
Three other possibi"

"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz pulled out a strategic victory at Saturday’s Arizona Republican Party convention, nailing down a large majority of delegates to the national convention amid cheating accusations from backers of businessman Donald Trump.
The Cruz slate won virtually all of the 28 at-large national delegates and roughly split the 27 delegates selected by congressional district.
Former Gov. Jan Brewer, losing her first election in 35 years, angrily yelled “I got cheated — I got cheated,” as the results became known.

"Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz succeeded Saturday in picking up more delegates at state GOP conventions in Arizona and Virginia, advancing his plan to win the nomination at a contested national convention.
Mr. Cruz suffered painful loses to front-runner Donald Trump in both states but positioned party activists at the state conventions to elect the majority of his supporters as delegates."
"A lot can still happen at the Democratic convention, but nothing is likely to matter as much as Hillary Clinton’s look and tone, what she says—or perhaps more important—what she doesn’t say as she takes the stage Thursday night. Donald Trump, a man of iron predictability, faced no such test last week and delivered no surprises."

"It’s not easy to run a hideous dictatorship and still have fans and defenders in fashionable quarters, but the Castro regime has managed it for decades.
The mass, spontaneous protests that broke out all over Cuba last weekend are yet another sign that the country’s government lacks legitimacy. In Cuba, it is the government versus the people, and lo, all these years, Castro’s apologists have been with the government."
"Republican candidate and former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is projected to win the governor’s race. She replaces term-limited Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. Sanders will be Arkansas' first female governor.

"Religious liberty and free speech are among Americans' personal freedoms potentially imperiled along with government overreach during the coronavirus pandemic, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito warned Thursday.
“Tolerance for opposing views is now in short supply,” Alito added in a virtual keynote speech to a conference of the conservative Federalist Society, in which he referenced the current state of discourse in the nation's law schools and the “broader academic community.”
Many recent law school graduates claim they face “harassment” and “retaliation” for any views that depart “from law school orthodoxy,”..."
"With tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to protest Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, questions are swirling about whether the anger is as organic as advertised.
From coast to coast, demonstrators are burning flags and effigies of the president-elect while declaring that they refuse to accept Trump’s victory. But observers online are claiming that, in some cases, protesters were bused to the scenes - a telltale sign of coordination.

"After a federal judge gave the Justice Department a deadline to determine whether former President Trump supports or opposes unsealing the search warrant and property receipt used by the FBI to search his Mar-a-Lago home Monday, the former president said he heartily supports the move.

"We are repeatedly told by gun control advocates and their like-minded media voices that the reason gun control legislation rarely passes because so many lawmakers accept contributions from the National Rifle Association’s affiliated PACs, and/or are supported by the group’s super PAC.
The irony is that this argument continues, even though the NRA is probably at its lowest point in at least a decade, and perhaps much longer. The organization’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, rarely if ever does interviews anymore, because he knows he’ll be asked about the NRA paying..."

"Millions of Americans are traveling home for Christmas this year, despite official handwringing about the need for caution in the face of the new omicron variant. On December 20, some 2.1 million people passed through airport checkpoints according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
That's nearly double the roughly 1 million people who thought it wise to travel on the same day during last year's holiday season, when deaths and hospitalizations from COVID-19 were at record highs across much of the country. The American Automobile Association (AAA) projects that people traveling over 50 miles from..."
"The 2008 Democrat nomination was permanently reshuffled when Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the Iowa Caucus. Obama’s win surprised pundits at the time, but a new poll from Bloomberg/Des Moines Register suggests another Hillary defeat is possible. This potential upset is being broadcast five months early.
In the new survey, Hillary has the support of just 37 percent of likely Democrat caucus voters. Sanders has nearly doubled his support, garnering 30 percent in the poll. Vice President Joe Biden, who is not a candidate, earns 14 percent support.

"Republicans in the Senate secured enough votes Friday evening to reject Democratic efforts to extend the Trump impeachment trial and call new witnesses, as the final vote on whether or not to remove President Trump from office seems likely to drag into next week.
After hours of debate during the day, the Senate voted 51 to 49 to block a Democratic motion to call new witnesses. The vote came after vehement demands from Democrats to call former national security adviser John Bolton to testify about the Trump-Ukraine saga."
"MSNBC rushed to the defense of a George-Soros-linked group that is set to takeover Miami’s iconic, Spanish-language conservative talk radio station Radio Mambi. 
The formation of the Latino Media Network, a new network set to be made up of 18 Hispanic radio stations including Miami’s conservative Radio Mambi, was partially financed by Lakestar Finance, an investment group affiliated with Soros Fund Management.

"When President Joe Biden delivered a prime-time address in Philadelphia on Thursday, the dark red setting generated a great deal of buzz.
Biden's speech, in which he framed November's midterm elections as a continuation of his 2020 cycle's ""battle for the soul of the nation"" and portrayed MAGA forces, perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and his allies, as being ""determined to take this country backwards,"" was delivered outside Independence Hall.

"President Joe Biden has announced the latest round of sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies against Russia in response to the now weeks-long Russian military campaign in Ukraine.
In an address Friday, Biden said he will sign bipartisan legislation that will revoke Russia’s permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status with the United States, making it more difficult for Russia to do business with the West.
Biden says the move to end normal trade relations with Russia was done in coordination with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European..."
"A large majority of Americans don’t believe taxpayer money should be used to pay reparations to black Americans, but the data collected in a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June is split along racial and partisan lines.
While polling data following the death of George Floyd has revealed that a significant majority of Americans support criminal justice reform, reparations do not have a comparable degree of support, the new poll shows.
The poll shows that one in ten white respondents supported the idea of reparations, while half of black respondents to the..."
"So, it’s Kamala. After all the speculation about whom Biden might pick to be his running mate, he chose the woman most likely to get the nod all along, according to the betting markets.
The California senator was and is widely seen as the “safe” choice, given the constraints Biden had imposed on himself. He pledged to pick a woman, and after the George Floyd protests he seemed increasingly likely to pick an African-American woman.
Harris checks both boxes, and as the only black female Democratic senator or governor in..."

"The Green New Deal has come, believe it or not, to the state of Texas. How's it working out so far?
Well, the good news is all that alternative energy seems to have had a remarkable effect on the climate. Sunday night, parts of Texas got the temperatures that we typically see in Alaska. In fact, they were the same as they were in Alaska. So global warming is no longer a pressing concern in Houston.
The bad news is, they don't have electricity. The windmills froze, so the..."
"The battle to ban abortions after five months continues today in Texas. The Texas Senate Committee on Health and Human Services is expected to hold a hearing on HB2 Monday, a bill requiring abortion clinics meet basic medical standards while banning abortions after 20 weeks.

"Joe Biden is accusing President Donald Trump of fueling the white supremacy that's blamed for several mass shootings in the United States in a speech the Democrat was due to deliver Wednesday.
Biden, 76, frontrunner in the crowded pack of Democras running for the White House, was scheduled to speak in Iowa after back-to-back mass shootings last weekend in the United States.

"President Biden’s Soviet-born choice to lead a key branch of the Treasury Department was grilled during a confirmation hearing Thursday, with one Republican member of the Senate Banking committee saying he had “never seen a more radical nominee to be a federal regulator.”
Saule Omarova, nominated by Biden to be comptroller of the currency in September, has come under fire for past statements — most notably in a paper titled “The People’s Ledger” that advocated for ending banking “as we know it” by making private banks “non-depository lenders” and moving Americans’ money to the Federal Reserve."

"In ten days, the U.S. Treasury will be left with just $30 billion cash on hand, and no legal authority to borrow the additional money needed to pay all of the United States's financial obligations. And yet, for some reason, markets are not acting like the U.S. will default on its debt payments. Instead, investors are actually buying more Treasuries."

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves LeDrian announced the move to recall ambassador Philippe Etienne Friday night, saying it came in a request from French President Emmanuel Macron.

"Joe Biden is a career liar and he lied some more in the debate, for instance when he dismissed the now well-supported New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s business dealing as “a Russian plant.” There is zero evidence for this. He offered this line:
There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. Five former heads of the CIA — both parties — say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good..."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Thursday the Republican plan to reduce enhanced unemployment benefits is unacceptable and the overall $1 trillion price tag of the GOP proposal falls far short of what is needed to combat the virus and its economic impact.

The plot: The rollout of President Barack Obama's health care law turns into such a disaster that enraged voters rebuke him by rewarding the GOP with undisputed control of Congress.
But there's a risk for Republicans if they're wrong and the Affordable Care Act works reasonably well, particularly in states that have embraced it. Republicans might be seen as obstinately standing in the way of progress."

At the Congress’s first plenum, which convenes immediately after the Congress ends, the members of the new Politburo Standing Committee will be revealed as they walk from behind a curtain. Everyone expects Xi to lead the pack as ruler for..."
"The Newsweek reporter who was fired after writing an inaccurate article about President Trump's Thanksgiving Day plans is deflecting some of the blame onto her editor.
Newsweek initially published the article Thursday morning, before the president's trip to Afghanistan was announced publicly. The story's initial headline was, “How is Trump spending Thanksgiving? Tweeting, golfing and more.”"
"An attorney has said that a second whistleblower has come forward to speak with the intelligence community inspector general about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, including issues surrounding a controversial July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Zaid said the second whistleblower has firsthand knowledge of the events detailed in the first whistleblower's complaint..."
"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting — the first time since 2018 that the central bank has hiked interest rates in an effort to get inflation under control.
The Fed also indicated it will raise rates several times this year, a sharp about-face from its massive, credit-extending policies to aid the ailing the economy during the pandemic."
"He's back.
Following months of dropping hints about another run for the White House, former President Donald Trump officially debuted his 2024 presidential campaign at his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, on Tuesday night in the hope of making ""America great and glorious again.""
Though Trump is the first major Republican contender to throw his hat in the ring, his announcement comes as the GOP is reeling from a lackluster midterm outing, and some in the party are weighing dumping the former president for rising star Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL).
""There's never been anything like it, this great movement..."
"The story of the coronavirus pandemic is still being written. But at this early date, we can see all kinds of moments where different decisions could have lessened the severity of the outbreak we are currently enduring. You have probably heard variations of, “Chinese authorities denied that the virus could be transferred from human to human until it was too late.” What you have probably not heard is how emphatically, loudly, and repeatedly the Chinese government insisted human transmission was impossible, long after doctors in Wuhan had concluded human transmission..."
"The effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom has received the necessary number of verified signatures to trigger a recall election later this year.
The California Secretary of State said on Monday that the threshold of verified signatures reported by counties, which was set at 1,495,709, had been met.
The campaign collected more than 1.6 million verified signatures, according to the secretary of state’s office. ""This now triggers the next phase of the recall process, a 30-business-day period in which voters may submit written requests to county Registrars of Voters..."

"If only mobs were allowed to destroy federal property without consequence.
Then, there wouldn’t have to be any dispute over federal agents defending a federal courthouse in Portland, Ore. It could simply be overrun and burned to the ground with no unwelcome resistance.
As it is, Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, who presides over a city that has become a watchword over the years for left-wing thuggery unchecked by municipal authorities, has roused himself to state of high dudgeon — over federal officers trying to counter ongoing assaults on a federal..."
"New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued President Trump and his three eldest children on Thursday as directors of the Donald J. Trump Foundation, seeking to dissolve the not-for-profit organization for ""persistent illegal conduct,"" according to court documents.

"For the first time in over two months, COVID-19 cases are declining in the United States.
As of September 6, the U.S. is averaging 137,000 new daily cases nationwide, a nine percent decrease from the 151,000 case average two weeks ago on August 24.
It is the first time since June 30 that the national average is lower than the total from two weeks earlier.
The Delta variant-fueled COVID-19 surge began soon after June 30, striking the Midwest in early July.
A decline in cases could signal that the case surge that..."
"Bans on abortions in Mississippi and Florida are taking effect this week in spite of efforts in the courts seeking to block the laws.
The news comes amid continuing legal battles in multiple U.S. states over abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court decision on June 24 that overturned Roe v. Wade and sent regulation of the procedure back to the states.
The 1973 landmark Roe decision had largely enabled abortions to be carried out for up to 24 weeks of pregnancy across the country for almost five decades.
In Mississippi, the state’s legislature had in 2007 passed a trigger..."
"The Olympic Games in Tokyo are doomed. Before the opening ceremony, before even the torch is lit, it’s not going to be OK. The Games, I’m afraid, just aren’t woke enough. Apologies to Tokyo and Japan — and #StopAsianHate and so on. But for the international left, sport no longer matters unless it can be used to win on Twitter and advance the War for Progress. 
Professional football can no longer be about the game. It must be a staging ground for raising awareness of racism and police brutality. Classrooms can no..."
"The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will soon have a new warning from the Food and Drug Administration after the shot was linked to a rare but serious side effect in a handful of patients, it was revealed Monday. 
The side effect, Guillain-Barré syndrome — a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks the body’s nerves — has been detected in about 100 people after 12.8 million jabs of the single-dose shot were administered, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the Washington Post. "
"President Trump must turn over his tax returns to a New York grand jury, a federal judge ruled Monday, rejecting the White House’s effort to shield him.
Mr. Trump immediately filed an emergency appeal with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Judge Victor Marrero called the president’s attempt to avoid turning over his taxes in a criminal case “extraordinary,” and rejected Mr. Trump’s claims that he would be distracted from his official duties by having to worry about complying with the prosecutors’ demands.
“The interest the president asserts in..."
"A large group of truck drivers who object to COVID-19 mandates drove two loops around the beltway surrounding Washington, Sunday, deliberately moving slowly to impact traffic and make their feelings known to lawmakers in the nation’s capitol.
People crowded onto overpasses, waving at the “People’s Convoy” and holding signs and American flags. Within the convoy, there were tractor-trailers with horns blaring and some recreational vehicles and pickup trucks occasionally going by, mixed with the normal traffic on Interstate 495 in Silver Springs, Maryland. 
The convoy was moving normally – albeit..."
"Moscow abandoned two major areas in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region Saturday after Ukrainian forces choked out a major supply point for Russian troops.
“In order to achieve the declared goals of the special military operation for the liberation of Donbas, it was decided to regroup the Russian forces stationed near Balakleya and Izyum to boost efforts in the Donetsk direction,” Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov told TASS.

"Senate Democrats on Monday unveiled a sweeping, $3.5 trillion blueprint to boost social spending, raise taxes and pass a range of Democratic policies from electric car purchases to immigration reform under special budget rules.
Democrats hope to ram through the massive spending program without Republican support — vastly expanding federal renewable energy projects, putting new pollution fees in place, and setting up universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, free community college and subsidized paid family and sick leave."
"The attorney for the former Port Authority official at the center of the George Washington Bridge scandal said there is evidence showing that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was aware of the lane closures when they happened.
Alan L. Zegas, who is representing David Wildstein, the official who ordered the lane closures and resigned as a result last year, said in a letter to the legal counsel for the Port Authority that there is evidence “tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when..."
"The Wuhan coronavirus has forced secondary and post-secondary schools, colleges and universities to rethink how they teach America's youth. Earlier this spring, educators were forced to adapt and teach their lessons online. As the coronavirus pandemic rages on and schools look to the fall, many are preparing to continue with remote learning. The use of online classes has the federal government rethinking its Visa program, especially for foreign students planning to study here in the United States.

"Just over a year after Donald J. Trump descended his iconic escalator in Manhattan to announce he was joining a packed field of political veterans seeking the Republican nomination for president, the New York billionaire completed an astonishing and historic political ascent Thursday night in Cleveland, officially claiming his party’s nomination — and declaring to struggling Americans, “I am your voice.”
Trump electrified the convention crowd on closing night, with chants of “U.S.A.” frequently breaking out as the nominee vowed to put “America first.” He used the speech to align..."
"In a notable return to Obama-era policies, President-elect Joe Biden is reportedly planning to use executive power to cancel the federal permits needed to construct the Keystone XL pipeline in his first days in office.

"The United States will begin widely distributing COVID-19 booster shots next month and will recommend them for most Americans who received the vaccine, according to several top federal health officials.
A joint statement from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, and acting Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Janet Woodcock said people will need boosters starting eight months after they received their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer..."
"Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci during his testimony in front of a Senate panel.
“It is a fatal conceit to believe any one person or small group of people has the knowledge necessary to direct an economy or dictate public health behavior,” Paul said Tuesday. “I think government health experts during this pandemic need to show caution in their prognostications.”
The senator accused public health experts of “instilling undue fear” in school teachers over the coronavirus pandemic, and reiterated his desire to see schools reopen in..."
"President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro met briefly in Panama, shaking hands and exchanging words in their first encounter since December when they started work on restoring diplomatic ties strained for a half century.
The pair, who spoke by phone two days ago, saw each other briefly Friday in Panama City as they joined other leaders at Atlapa Convention Center before a formal dinner to start the Summit of the Americas meeting. The two probably will spend more time together on Saturday, Ben Rhodes, White House deputy national..."
"Last year, I met with a group of students who had endured the foster-care system. Anthony was moved from foster home to foster home for 18 years — his entire childhood. Another, David, had entered foster care at eight years old. He was placed in seven different inpatient facilities within six months. Both expressed their hope that no child would ever have to experience what they had.
This week, President Trump signed an executive order to help kids like Anthony and David. The order, which will decrease the time that..."
"The Senate early Wednesday approved rules for the impeachment trial of President Trump, wrapping up a marathon session that marked the first day of arguments in the historic proceedings.

"America’s ballooning national debt has exceeded the $30 trillion mark for the first time ever, according to Treasury Department data.
The Treasury Department said in a statement (pdf) that, as of Jan. 31, the total public debt outstanding was $30.012 trillion, which roughly works out to just over $90,000 per citizen or nearly $240,000 per taxpayer.

"The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Aug. 17 announced that the agency would be revamped, after a review found it did not adequately respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director, informed the approximately 13,000 CDC employees of the planned changes, which include reorganizing the agency in an attempt to make quicker decisions, be more accountable, and improve communication.
The changes are spurred by a review that started in April, which found the agency’s “traditional scientific and communication processes were not adequate to effectively respond to..."

"President Trump, speaking in unusually somber tones, told Americans on Tuesday to brace for a “very, very painful two weeks” and begged them to stay at home as much as possible through April 30, saying 100,000 to 200,000 people could die from COVID-19 despite his team’s best efforts to fight the coronavirus and that they want to depress that number.
Mr. Trump wanted to get the nation “raring to go” by Easter, but sobering models forced him to reverse course and plead with people to work and learn at home,..."

In this fictional made-for-TV movie, Santa’s workshop is attacked by machine-gun-wielding terrorists. Amid heavy artillery fire, Mrs. Claus races to the gun locker to hand out heavy weapons to the elves.

The vaccine is already available for anyone 12 and older in..."

"If there’s a genre that’s worn out its welcome, it’s the self-hagiographical tell-all tome by some second-tier Trump administration hack who tries to leverage his track record of failure into a cash advance and some MSNBCNN hits fielding softballs from guys best known for punishing the primate on Zoom calls. How fitting. The latest example is Mark Esper, who would be the worst Secretary of Defense ever if not for the determined competition from the current one. I would not normally name this pompous tool’s ridiculous book, but his title..."
"New York is trying to dissolve the National Rifle Association (NRA), announcing a lawsuit against the gun-rights group.
The state attorney general on Thursday said the NRA engages in ""illegal self-dealings"" after filing a lawsuit in state court in Manhattan following an 18-month investigation into the organization.

"A report prepared for the Senate that provides the most sweeping analysis yet of Russia’s disinformation campaign around the 2016 election found the operation used every major social media platform to deliver words, images and videos tailored to voters’ interests to help elect President Trump — and worked even harder to support him while in office."
"The Senate voted to acquit President Trump of two articles of impeachment, ending a monthslong effort by Democrats to remove him from office.
Democrats fell far short of winning the needed 67 votes to convict the president of either the abuse of power or the obstruction of Congress charges. The vote fell largely along party lines, reflecting poll numbers showing a sharp partisan divide on the issue.
One Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney, voted with Democrats on the abuse of power charge, but no Democrats voted to acquit the president. The..."

The legal question was whether asylum seekers can seek habeas corpus, the basic right to have your detention reviewed by a judge, when they are fast-tracked for..."

"News that Gov. Cuomo’s office had radically understated the number of COVID-19 deaths in New York nursing homes last year deflated his media image as a straight-talking teller of home truths. Now The Post has reported that the governor covered up the extent of the problem specifically because his office didn’t want President Trump to “turn this into a giant political football” by instructing the Department of Justice to investigate Cuomo’s handling of the situation.
In other words, Cuomo buried evidence and impeded a federal investigation, hoping a new..."
"A handful of peacekeepers, including several Americans, have reportedly died in a helicopter crash that occurred in the Sinai Peninsula.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Wednesday:
White House senior staff had two productive meetings today with the bipartisan..."
"Earlier today the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users from following his @realDonaldTrump account. It’s an interesting decision from an ideologically diverse judicial panel that at first glance appears to be a straightforward application of conventional First Amendment law. It’s also wrong. It makes a crucial error that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of speech on private social-media platforms.
Boiled down to its essence, the court’s reasoning contained two key elements. First, it ruled that Trump’s Twitter account represents an outlet for official..."
"Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on Friday pitched himself as the most conservative governor in the history of Florida, saying his record of success is something people yearn for in a Washington, D.C., culture that has not yet “contaminated” him.
“I was the most conservative governor in the state’s history, but I had a reformer’s heart,” Mr. Bush said, speaking at the Des Moines Register political soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. “We cut taxes every year totaling $19 billion. We reduced the state government workforce by 13,000. In fact,..."

"For the first third of the 2021 fiscal year, the national deficit jumped to $736 billion as coronavirus spending took its toll on the federal government, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday.
The large sum is roughly 89% higher than the same four-month period in 2020, representing the time before COVID-19 reached the United States. January 2021 added roughly $163 billion to the deficit, the majority of which came from Social Security, health expenditures, and income security payments.
In the four months combined, the government spent roughly $435 billion on income..."

A draft of the bill was circulated around the state House and Senate Saturday, and the legislature is expected to pass the legislation and send it to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk shortly.

The overwhelming majority of student debt is held by the affluent; less than 10 percent of it is held by the bottom third of earners. Nearly 40 percent of it is..."

The phrase media literacy ordinarily implies helping individuals make sense of the media landscape, but AOC seems to have more in mind than that: She suggested ""we're going to have to figure out how we rein in our media environment so that you can't just spew disinformation and misinformation.""
It's true that both traditional media and social media sometimes spread ""disinformation..."

"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Sunday flatly denied that he’s “tapping into the anger” of voters across the country — a charge that has been made by his Republican primary rivals, political pundits of all stripes, and even President Obama.
In an interview with ABC News, Mr. Trump said his campaign is built not on anger but on the idea that, with the proper leadership, the nation’s problems can be solved quickly."
"Some conservatives say that Donald Trump is a menace to the Constitution, because he seems intent on picking up Barack Obama’s D.C.-approved extra-constitutional powers and using them for his own Trump-ian purposes, maybe even going further down the path to executive-order dictatorship than Obama did.

Biden made the remarks at a speech Thursday, suggesting U.S. allies including Turkey,..."
"The White House declined to specifically name any oil and gas companies that President Biden blamed earlier Thursday for exploiting the rise in energy prices and lining the pockets of investors.
National Economic Council Director Brian Deese was asked during Thursday’s press briefing to identify what companies the Biden administration considers to be good actors or bad actors.
""I want to give you an opportunity, for Americans who want to do the patriotic thing, where should they be going to buy their gas right now?"" the reporter asked. ""Are there good companies that have worked with..."
"Representative Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R., Ga.) apologized Monday for her comments last month comparing COVID-19 restrictions to the persecution of Jews by the Nazis.
After a visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., Greene said she had “made a mistake” and that there is “nothing comparable” to the Holocaust.
“I have made a mistake, and it’s really bothered me for a couple of weeks now, and so I definitely want to own it,” she said. “This afternoon I visited the Holocaust Museum. The Holocaust is — there’s nothing comparable to..."

"Pfizer said Tuesday it expects to do $26 billion in sales this year from its two-shot COVID-19 vaccine alone.
That’s up more than 70 percent from its last forecast, largely thanks to new contracts signed with countries struggling to get their hands on vaccine doses.
The estimate assumes that Pfizer will deliver 1.6 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. Across all of its products, Pfizer said in its first-quarter earnings report that it expects to make between $70.5 billion and $72.5 billion in revenue this year."
"Guns and marijuana users don't go together, said a federal appeals court in upholding a ruling that medical pot users cannot buy weapons and affirming that ""the Second Amendment does not protect the rights of unlawful drug users to bear arms.""
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel in San Francisco on Wednesday set back the case of S. Rowan Wilson who was denied the purchase of a firearm in 2011 after she obtained a medical marijuana card in Nevada, said Reuters.

"The second night of the first Democrat presidential primary debate birthed a new star and knocked the luster off the frontrunner.
Over the course of two hours, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) distinguished herself by using her skills as a prosecutor to draw blood, targeting former Vice President Joe Biden's talk this week about his history of working across the aisle.
""It's personal and I was actually – it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the..."
"Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday he opposes using the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty military forces to American cities to quell riots and protests.
In a press conference at the Pentagon, Mr. Esper said the use of active-duty troops should be a “last resort” for the country, and he does not believe such a course is necessary or appropriate right now. President Trump earlier this week threatened to invoke the 1807 law if governors do not activate National Guard forces to control crowds and stop widespread looting. Protests have..."
"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is expected to meet with Senate Republicans Tuesday to discuss an $850 billion coronavirus relief package including aid for hard-hit industries.
White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans.
The U.S. airline industry said it has lost about one million passengers in the first two weeks of March alone, compared with the same period a year ago.
President Trump said Monday the..."
"U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month as a number of states ended extended unemployment benefits before the September expiration.  
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 943,000 workers in July as the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, the Labor Department said Friday. Analysts surveyed by Refintiv were expecting 870,000 jobs gained and the unemployment rate to fall to 5.7% from 5.9%. June’s reading was revised higher by 88,000 jobs to 938,000.

"The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit Tuesday alleging that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search-advertising that form the cornerstones of its vast conglomerate, according to senior Justice officials.
The long-anticipated case, iled in a Washington, D.C., federal court, marks the most aggressive U.S. legal challenge to a company’s dominance in the tech sector in more than two decades, with the potential to shake up Silicon Valley and beyond. Once a public darling, Google attracted considerable scrutiny over the past decade as it gained..."
"Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted Wednesday evening of recruiting and grooming underage girls for years as Jeffrey Epstein’s madam — capping a stunning fall from grace for the British socialite who could now spend the rest of her life behind bars.
Maxwell, who turned 60 Christmas day, sat still as the unanimous verdict on five of six counts was read aloud. When it was done, she poured herself a cup of water from a Fiji bottle and took a swig, then conferred with her lawyer.
She showed no emotion as she..."
"Facebook’s Oversight Board decided to uphold Facebook’s and Instagram’s suspension of former President Donald Trump from their platforms today. This decision is the wrong one, and one that all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, should be concerned about. However, the Oversight Board was entirely appropriate to admonish Facebook for the fact that its penalty was vague and standardless.
Big Tech companies should not be allowed to play by a set of rules that give them undue influence over American society while also avoiding any accountability for how they use that..."
"CNN, The New York Times, The Hill and NBC News have recently highlighted criticism of President Biden from members of his own party in the wake of the Supreme Court's abortion decision and Democrats facing potentially difficult midterms in the fall. 
The Hill reported Wednesday that Biden was finding himself to be ""powerless"" in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in addition to several other issues hammering the administration. 
The report notes that while Biden's ""hands are largely tied"" when it comes to issues like mass..."

"President Trump has asserted executive privilege over a host of documents related to the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the Justice Department said Wednesday, thwarting Congressional Democrats’ attempts to subpoena the materials.
Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd alerted the House Oversight Committee of the move in a letter, saying Democrats had soured the chances for cooperation by moving to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress."
"President Trump said Monday the Supreme Court vacancy should be filled by the Nov. 3 election.
“I think it should go very quickly, we have a lot of time,” Mr. Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.”
The president is likely to announce his pick on Friday or Saturday for who he wants to fill the high court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday.
If the president announces his nominee by the end of this week, that would leave just under 40 days..."
"The DNC's Tuesday agenda featured exactly one major primetime headliner: Former President Bill Clinton, who set out to build an emotionally-rooted case on behalf of his wife, whom their party had nominated for the presidency hours earlier. In 2012, I remember sitting in the arena rafters in Charlotte, watching with helpless frustration and dismay as our 42nd president articulated the most compelling (if fact-challenged) argument for Barack Obama's re-election that I'd seen to date."
"YouTube is expanding its vaccine misinformation policies to include all vaccines approved by health agencies, pursuing more aggressive enforcement against anti-vaccine content and deleting specific accounts.
The social media company will remove any content that “falsely alleges” vaccines approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) are dangerous or ineffective at reducing transmission, as well as content that claims the vaccines contain certain substances, YouTube said in a blog post Wednesday announcing its new guidelines. Examples include claims that vaccines cause autism, infertility, or include microchips and tracking devices, the company said.

"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away Friday at age 87 from complications related to metastatic pancreatic cancer, the Court announced.
“Our Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature,” said Chief Justice John Roberts. “We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice.”
Ginsburg was appointed to the court by President Bill Clinton in 1993. She immediately staked out a position..."
"U.S. hiring was the weakest in more than a year while wage gains were the fastest of the expansion and the unemployment rate fell, a possible sign that America’s jobs engine is starting to slow down.
Treasuries rallied while the dollar and stock futures fell.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 20,000 after an upwardly revised 311,000 gain the prior month, a Labor Department report showed Friday.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase of 180,000. Average hourly earnings rose a better-than- projected 3.4 percent from a year..."
"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday delivered a stark message on the state of the U.S. economy at the annual central bank gathering in Wyoming: Inflation remains painfully high, and cooling it will require forceful action that could soon bring ""pain"" to households and businesses nationwide. 
In his hotly anticipated speech at the Kansas Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium, Powell reiterated a pledge to ""forcefully"" fight inflation that is still running near the hottest pace in 40 years and wrestle it closer to the Fed's 2% goal. 
""While higher..."
"Left-wing activists made multiple false and misleading claims on Thursday following President Donald Trump’s White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefing in which the president commented on new scientific findings from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
The activists falsely claimed that Trump “urged Americans to inject themselves with disinfectant” and “told people to drink bleach.”
To understand Trump’s remarks, it’s important to first understand the full context of what was said at the press briefing.
Bill Bryan, Under Secretary for Science and Technology at DHS, said at the press..."
"On another terrible day, I hate to introduce even more pessimism, but when we discuss mass shootings, one of the first questions we ask is the simplest and also the hardest to answer. Why? Why does this keep happening? Those who advocate for gun control have an immediate answer — the prevalence of guns in the United States. Yet guns have been part of the fabric of American life for the entire history of our republic. Mass shootings — especially the most deadly mass shootings — are a far more..."
"Scrambling to regain his footing in the Buckeye State, Mitt Romney enlisted the help Wednesday of a golf legend and a television star with the sort of blue-collar credentials that could resonate with the states working-class voters. President Obama, meanwhile, made his own Ohio pitch to college crowds at Bowling Green and Kent State.
The dueling visits spoke volumes about the critical role that Ohio Ã¢â‚¬â€ a state where manufacturing jobs in the automobile industry and other sectors have been lost in recent years as companies have shifted operations..."
"A majority of Americans, including a plurality of Democrats, believe there is an invasion occurring at the southern border, a Thursday poll from Ipsos and NPR found.
Overall, 54% of Americans believed it is true or “somewhat true” that the U.S. is experiencing an invasion at the southern border, while half of Americans believed that migrants carrying fentanyl across the border were responsible for rising drug deaths and 42% believe the U.S. has an open border policy, the poll found, interpreting “true” and “somewhat true” responses to denote agreement with the..."
"Joe Biden praised the idea of incorporating fact-checkers into the presidential debates, but those desperately needed fact-checkers were nowhere to be found at CNN's town hall event with Biden on Thursday.
In stark contrast to President Trump's town hall event with ABC's George Stephanopoulos earlier this week, CNN's Anderson Cooper and a crowd of mostly friendly supporters took turns asking the 77-year-old candidate softball questions.
Biden told all sorts of lies during the one-hour event on CNN, a fitting location for such fake news. Biden lied when he..."
"Make no mistake: the so-called Inflation Reduction Act unveiled Wednesday by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-NY), and Sen. Joe Manchin, (D-WV), will do nothing that its supporters state — in fact, it will do quite the opposite.
If passed, the act will increase the prices that Americans pay for energy, make the United States less energy-secure, and do absolutely nothing for the environment. Perhaps more insidious, it will hurt Americans who live in coal-rich states, like Manchin’s West Virginia, the most.
Focusing on just the energy and climate section of the..."

An acclaimed storyteller, Morrison was born in Ohio in 1931 and is known for her essays and books exploring the culture and experience of African Americans.

Over her decades-long career, Morrison penned 11 novels, multiple children’s books, two plays, and an opera. Among her most famous works..."
"A group of ex-Republicans and Democrats has announced the formation of a third party, the latest effort to break the duopoly that has dominated American politics for more than a century.
Co-chaired by former Democratic presidential and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang and former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the “Forward” party is pitching itself as an alternative for centrists dissatisfied with the state of the two major parties."
"On his way out the door as Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta has lifted the ban on women serving in combat roles on the front lines of our wars. More from AP:
Senior defense officials say Pentagon chief Leon Panetta is removing the military's ban on women serving in combat, opening hundreds of thousands of front-line positions and potentially elite commando jobs after more than a decade at war.

"Special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence that anyone connected with President Trump or his 2016 campaign conspired with Russia to subvert the election, according to a summary of his findings released Sunday by Attorney General William Barr.
Yet Mr. Mueller did find actions by Mr. Trump after he was in office that could be seen as efforts to obstruct the investigation into the election. Mr. Mueller did not recommend prosecution, but he left the decision up to Mr. Barr, who said he doesn’t see enough evidence of a crime..."

"Citing an internal email provided by an FBI whistleblower, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee revealed Tuesday that the Bureau has created a system to track threats against school board officials and administrators, and accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of misleading lawmakers when he was asked about the subject during his previous testimony before the committee.
The FBI’s “Counterterrorism and Criminal Divisions created a threat tag, EDUOFFICIALS, to track instances of related threats,” according to the email. “The purpose of the threat tag is to help scope this threat on..."
"The email, which was signed by Timothy Langan, the FBI’s assistant director for counterterrorism, said the Counterterrorism Division and Criminal Division had created a ""threat tag"" for FBI officials to use. The email directs bureau agents to tag threats as “EDUOFFICIALS” and to ""attempt to identify"" the motivation behind the threat and whether there are ""federal violations that can be investigated and charged.""

"The Obama administration on Friday imposed a wave of sanctions against members of the North Korean government, amounting to the U.S. government's first official response to the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment.
Despite lingering questions from private security analysts over whether North Korea was responsible for the hack -- as the FBI has alleged -- the White House described the new sanctions as retaliation against Pyongyang.
""We take seriously North Korea's attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and..."

In a Tuesday letter to Director Chris Wray, Democratic senators accused the FBI of being “politically constrained by the Trump White House,” demanding to know what extent the agency vetted tips and whether the administration prevented it from doing so.
The letter was written by Sens. Dick Durbin, Patrick Leahy, Chris Coons, Cory Booker, Mazie Hirono, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Richard Blumenthal."
"If Kyrsten Sinema was the first Democrat to breach the gates of the Biden administration’s domestic agenda, Joe Manchin kicked the door wide open and showed others the way.  
Just before a weary nation paused for the holiday weekend, the West Virginia Democrat took a hatchet to the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion spending package, which has become the crown jewel on the left’s legislative wish list.  
In a guest Wall Street Journal column, Manchin accurately accused the bill of having, ""no regard to rising inflation, crippling debt or the inevitability of future crises"" and said ""ignoring..."
"Brad Parscale’s abrupt demotion Wednesday night “shocked” some inside the Trump campaign, sources familiar with the move told Fox News, even as President Trump’s sliding poll numbers and the recent Tulsa rally debacle had raised questions about his future.
The president announced on Facebook and later on Twitter Wednesday night that Parscale would be replaced as campaign manager by Bill Stepien, who had served as deputy campaign manager."

“That’s a big thing,” he added. “I’ve always been very strongly in favor. ”

"The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee pointed to the “rosy picture” the State Department had painted about Afghanistan as opposed to the increasingly “grim” intelligence community assessments in explaining why he believed the Biden administration miscalculated the Taliban takeover so badly.
Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas told the Washington Examiner the Biden administration ignored the bleak assessments from the Pentagon and the intelligence community, and he critiqued the U.S. Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, who had negotiated the February 2020 deal in Doha, Qatar, with the Taliban..."
"Sometimes a responsibility falls to you that you never anticipated. Sometimes history just demands that someone should say it: Riots are bad. Riots are never a coherent or moral response to injustice, they just multiply injustices and the rioters themselves often suffer more in the long run.
Unfortunately it must be said, because absolute morons who would call the cops without hesitation if there were an unruly loudspeaker or birdwatcher in their nice neighborhoods are cheering on and excusing rioting — rioting that is destroying businesses, livelihoods, and even a..."
"A day after an interview aired in which President Obama declared he still has the lead, another national poll showed Mitt Romney slightly ahead while erasing Obama's advantage among women.
The Associated Press-GfK poll showed Romney pulling 47 percent of likely voters to Obama's 45 percent -- a split within the margin of error, but which certainly challenges the president's claim of having the edge. Even in the battleground states, which decide the election, polls now reflect a series of tossups.
The president had claimed the advantage over..."
"The College Board plans to introduce an “adversity score” that will accompany an applicant’s SAT score in order to give college-admissions officers greater insight into how the applicant’s social and economic privilege may have contributed to their academic performance.
The adversity score, which will be made available to colleges but not the students themselves, will reflect 15 different factors including the crime rate and average income level in a student’s neighborhood, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The new metric is currently being used by 50 colleges and will likely..."

The vote was 10..."
"Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has claimed that the number of people looking to enter the U.S. at the sourthern border could be the highest in 20 years, but in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday"" he claimed that this is because of the Trump administration's actions, not policy changes that took place in the early days of President Biden's administration.

"President Joe Biden on Tuesday rejected a Republican counterproposal to his $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan, saying the $618 billion offer was too small as Senate Democrats voted to begin a process for approving the larger bill, even without bipartisan support.
Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held a private virtual meeting with the Democratic senators on Tuesday, in which both said the Republican proposal, crafted by ten GOP senators, was too small."
"In his wisdom, Joe Biden has decided to declare there’s a crisis in our democracy that can only be fixed if two bills pass in the next several days that aren’t going to pass. Maybe for some perverse reason he likes appearing weak and ineffectual. Regardless, he has now done more than his share to undermine faith in our electoral system.
He tried to make Georgia the poster child for voter suppression based on last year’s election reform. Biden’s case was, predictably, incredibly weak. Georgia has limited drop boxes! Well, yeah, it..."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reinforced federal regulators’ decision earlier this week to authorize Pfizer booster doses for healthy people ages 12-15, a move that comes amid growing concerns that federal regulators are shutting out vaccine experts from decision-making.
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13-1 to recommend administering Pfizer booster doses to otherwise healthy adolescents ages 12-17 just hours before CDC Director Rochelle Walensky gave her final approval. The FDA authorized booster shots for 12- to 15-year-olds Monday and for 16- and 17-year-olds last month without convening..."

"Following Biden’s first press conference in months, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki quickly moved to walk back the president’s confusing claims regarding the potential illegitimacy of upcoming elections.
“[Let’s] be clear: [President Biden] was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election. He was making the opposite point: In 2020, a record number of voters turned out in the face of a pandemic, and election officials made sure they could vote and have those votes counted,” Psaki tweeted on the morning after the press conference. “He was explaining that..."

"Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), a rear admiral and doctor who worked as the White House physician from 2012 to 2018, first came under media fire when then-President Donald Trump nominated Jackson to head the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2018. Despite the fact that Jackson was seen as a competent and well-qualified doctor during the Obama administration, Trump’s nomination prompted numerous media reports accusing Jackson of inappropriate behavior during his time as White House physician.
The media onslaught ultimately forced Jackson to withdraw his name from consideration to lead the..."

"So that was it, wasn’t it?
The Super Bowl was our unofficial return to normality for the United States. A relatively normal game, with a halftime show geared toward people in their 40s. But the “normal” part was the crowd. It was the general atmosphere. The Chinese Olympics that nobody is watching feature athletes getting served by people in hazmat suits. Meanwhile, SoFi stadium gathered over 70,000 fans for the big game, and the cameras panning the vast crowd showed the spectators to be almost entirely maskless.
This was the end of..."
"WASHINGTON — A Russian spy unit paid members of Afghanistan’s Taliban movement to conduct lethal attacks on U.S. troops in that country, according to a classified American intelligence assessment, people familiar with the report said.
The assessment of the role played by Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, in fostering attacks on American soldiers, comes as President Trump is pushing the Pentagon to withdraw a significant portion of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and as U.S. diplomats try to forge a peace accord involving the Taliban and the U.S.-backed Afghan government."
"NBC News attempted this week to use the power of Google to cancel our publication, the Federalist. The effort failed, but it should serve as a warning about the unchecked power of big tech companies, particularly when they can be manipulated by partisans, including partisan journalists.

"This morning I wrote, “if Ed Gillespie loses, some Republicans will want to blame Trump, and he’ll deserve a share of the blame, but it’s a pretty limited share.” That assertion may need revision, with not merely Gillespie and the rest of the statewide ticket losing, but the Republicans in the Virginia state legislature getting demolished. At this hour, Republicans are in danger of losing control of the House of Delegates, where they entered Election Day with a seemingly comfortable 17-seat margin."
"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, admonished Trump’s team and House impeachment managers early Wednesday after the sides traded insults.
“I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and president’s counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world’s greatest deliberative body,” Roberts said in one of the few times he commented on Tuesday or so far Wednesday.

"A divided appeals court panel sided Friday with Ohio business owners who challenged the birth control mandate under the new federal health care law.
The business owners are two brothers, Francis and Philip M. Gilardi, who own Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics of Sidney, Ohio., and challenged the mandate on religious grounds. They say the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage would force them to violate their Roman Catholic beliefs and moral values by providing contraceptives such as the morning-after pill for their employees. The law already exempts houses of worship..."
"The hand recount of the 2020 Maricopa County, Ariz., election results found that President Biden defeated former president Trump in the county by a slightly larger margin than was recorded on Election Day.

"Senior government officials are privately sounding the alarm over a new cybersecurity executive order President Joe Biden is poised to sign.
Biden vowed in April to take steps toward securing U.S. cyber-infrastructure and preventing future security breaches like the 2020 SolarWinds hack.

"President Joe Biden witnessed the best midterm elections for any president in two decades after the projected Republican ""red wave"" missed its mark on Election Day.
Both chambers of Congress are up in the air, with Republicans holding 207 seats compared to Democrats' 184, with a majority of 218 needed. The Senate remains a toss-up, with Republicans holding 49 seats and Democrats, including two independents, holding 48. Senate races in Arizona and Nevada, as well as Georgia, which went to a runoff, will determine the majority.
Biden wrote in a..."
"It takes a lot to make a libertarian look forward to the next election.
Like, say, two years of miserable government mandates ignored by some of the very people imposing them. Like watching over 70,000 maskless adults (and many celebrities) partying at a major sporting event in a city where children are required to wear medical-grade masks to school and keep them on while playing sports. Like imposing border controls on immigration and travel meant to stop the spread of COVID-19, and then keeping them in place (with no off-ramp) long after the virus is spreading here."
"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other leading Democrats issued a statement Thursday afternoon thanking Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for a statement she issued Thursday morning “clarifying” a tweet Omar posted equating the United States and Israel to the terrorist regimes, Hamas and the Taliban — sidestepping calls to address Omar’s shocking language.
In the tweet, Omar suggested that the United States and Israel had committed “unthinkable atrocities” on part with those committed by terrorist organizations, including Hamas and the Taliban. In a short video, Omar demanded to..."
"Louisiana voters will head to the polls Saturday to decide on the lone outstanding U.S. Senate contest of 2014 and two outstanding U.S. House races.
In the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and GOPRep. Bill Cassidy, Ms. Landrieu has been struggling to get help from national Democratic groups after the Nov. 4 “jungle primary” in which neither candidate managed to eclipse 50 percent of the vote.
That sent the race into a Dec. 6 runoff, where polling shows Mr. Cassidy up double digits in a race that will..."
"Just last week, the president adamantly defended his Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, who is widely rumored to be a leading contender to replace Hillary Clinton at State. Rice appeared on all five Sunday morning shows on September 16, five days after the deadly 9/11 attacks. She advanced three core assertions for public consumption:
(1) The the violence had spilled over from ""spontaneous"" protests over an internet video. (There were no protests outside of the Benghazi consulate leading up to the attack).

"President Trump, in an interview with Fox & Friends that aired Saturday morning, declared the “country is full” and said the U.S. immigration system can no longer absorb a mass influx of illegal immigrants, but praised Mexico for stopping border crossings after his threat to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border.

"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot deserves credit for standing up to the Chicago Teachers Union. But the fact that so many Chicago teachers were willing to abandon their students in the first place is disgraceful. The next time they walk off the job in violation of the law, she shouldn’t negotiate with them — she should fire them.
It is appalling that nearly three-quarters of Chicago Teachers Union members voted to walk out, locking more than 300,000 students out of their schools. As Lightfoot made clear, their actions were not only illegal, they were..."
"President Obama has chosen Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., as his nominee to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder -- ending widespread speculation over who might fill Holder's shoes and teeing up a nomination debate potentially during the lame-duck session.
Though several Republicans had wanted to wait to consider any successor until the new Congress is seated, the president plans to announce his pick on Saturday.
""Ms. Lynch is a strong, independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. Attorney's offices in the..."

"Joe Biden is the likely Democratic presidential nominee, but he’s not acting like it.
The former vice president has been noticeably absent from the national stage over the past few weeks, while Congress has worked out a coherent relief package to aid the economy. Democratic governors, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have partnered with the Trump administration to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
The few appearances Biden has made have not exactly inspired confidence in his ability to lead the nation. In what appeared to be an attempt to..."
"President Joe Biden said Tuesday while in Pennsylvania that “brave right wing Americans” who claim the Second Amendment is meant to fight back against a tyrannical government would be obliterated by the military.

"Inflation surged again in January, notching another four-decade high as strong consumer demand and pandemic-related supply-chain snarls fueled rapid price gains that wiped out the benefits of rising wages for most Americans.
The consumer price index rose 7.5% in January from a year ago, according to a new Labor Department report released Thursday, marking the fastest increase since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.6%.

The panel will sit for three days a week for the next six months and will consider matters outside of the Trump inquiry, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

"I know. I know. “Trump is flawed” the critics say. “He is a clown.” “He is a buffoon.” “He’s divorced…twice.” “He has business bankruptcies.” Yes, all true.

Reagan was rejected by United Artists executives to PLAY the part of a president."
"President Trump called the House Democrats’ push for impeachment a “lynching” Tuesday as he called on Republicans to rally around him amid the inquiry.
Mr. Trump used the incendiary language as he tested a new line of attack, reasoning that Democrats should be careful what they wish for because he feels they are watering down the standard for impeachment.

NASA repeatedly stopped and started the fueling of the Space Launch System rocket with nearly 1 million gallons of super-cold hydrogen and oxygen..."
"The House of Representatives will vote to formalize impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter Monday.
The inquiry into the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set for Thursday, senior House Democratic aides told NPR. The GOP has expressed frustration with Democrats for not holding such a vote.
The resolution, which will be introduced in the House Rules Committee, will be the first vote the House takes as a whole regarding the authorization of the proceedings.

"Despite Wednesday’s inflation report indicating that consumer prices have risen by 7% over the past 12 months and accelerated to 9.1% over the past three months, the president and Democrats other than Sen. Joe Manchin remain firmly entrenched in a state of denial. In their telling, this inflation has nothing to do with their spending policy. This is the same argument we heard in the mid-1970s.
When we both began our careers in public service, the U.S. was suffering from the high inflation of the late 1970s. The federal government..."
"Lawyers for President Trump petitioned the US Supreme Court Thursday as part of his ongoing bid to keep his tax returns away from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.
Trump is appealing a decision from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which found Vance’s office can enforce subpoenas on Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, seeking eight years of his corporate and personal financial documents.
If the Supreme Court declines to hear the appeal, the ruling stands — allowing Vance’s office to seize the financial records.
Should they take..."
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday that if former President Donald Trump becomes the Republican Party's presidential nominee again in 2024, he would ""absolutely"" throw his support behind the former president.
But, he says, a lot could happen between now then.
During an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier, the anchor asked McConnell if he believed Trump would be the GOP nominee during the next president election as some have predicted.
""Well, there's a lot to happen between now and '24,"" the GOP leader responded, revealing, ""I've got..."
"Inflation rose more than expected in August, continuing to create severe financial pressure for U.S. households even as the cost of gasoline fell.
The Labor Department said Tuesday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 8.3% in August from a year ago. Prices climbed 0.1% in the one-month period from July.
Those figures were both higher than the 8.1% headline figure and 0.1% monthly decline forecast by Refinitiv economists, likely a worrisome sign for the Federal Reserve as it..."
"President Donald Trump will visit the cities where this weekend's mass shootings took place, according to news reports.
El Paso, Texas Mayor Dee Margo said at a news conference Monday the president will visit the city Wednesday, and Federal Aviation Administration adviseries suggest Trump will be in Dayton on the same day.
Margo, a Republican, has been a critic of Trump and earlier this year would not meet with him while he was in El Paso.
But he said Monday he would meet with him under his capacity as mayor..."
"An 'extreme heat belt' will form across the Midwest by 2053, according to a new study, leaving over 100million Americans regularly experiencing days over 125F.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that the House would take up legislation to ""further codify freedoms which Americans currently enjoy” after the Supreme Court struck down its previous ruling in Roe v. Wade in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
Pelosi condemned that decision in a blistering statement Friday. On Monday, she said the House would take up legislation to codify other matters decided by the high court and would again consider the Women’s Health Protection Act, a sweeping abortion rights bill that passed the House and failed in the Senate.

"People who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus can travel at low risk to themselves as long as they wear masks and take other precautions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday in a shift from its previous blanket discouragement against travel.
Individuals who are fully vaccinated — two weeks past their final shot — need not receive a COVID-19 test before or after domestic trips and do not need to self-quarantine after travel, the agency says.
The guidance adds that for international travel, testing is not necessary..."
"Twitter censored a tweet from The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh regarding the voter tabulations in Michigan — specifically an update on 128,000-plus votes that reportedly all came in for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden — after President Donald Trump quote-tweeted the post in seeming agreement with Walsh’s concern."
"Judgments and rules are two different things. Rules are, or should be, clear bright lines that can produce yes-or-no answers. Judgments are more complicated than that. They need not be as standardless as Potter Stewart’s famous definition of pornography (“I know it when I see it”), but judgments typically involve a good deal more weighing and balancing of multiple factors, sometimes in ways that don’t reduce to a mathematical formula. The Justice Department’s decision to drop the Michael Flynn false-statement prosecution, three years after he pleaded guilty, might not pass..."
"The House Judiciary Committee released a 658-page report detailing the impeachment case against President Trump early Monday morning, saying that ""President Trump has realized the Framers' worst nightmare.”
The report highlights what it claims are two impeachable offenses: Trump's abuse of power and obstructing Congress during its investigation.
""Taken together, the articles charge that President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections and our systems of checks and balances. He has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that will..."
"At Monday’s presidential debate Hillary Clinton’s asserted that Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe, was victimized about her weight by Donald Trump. Her remarks have, perhaps rightfully, given some women pause. So let’s reflect a moment and add some context to this allegation. Here’s where I’ve come down."
"In 1992, the infamous Democratic strategist and campaign adviser, James Carville, famously coined the phrase ""It’s the economy, stupid"" as part of a campaign effort to win voters to Bill Clinton. 
It was a contentious presidential year. President George H. W. Bush was seeking re-election but given the prevailing recession and growing economic uncertainty, Carville identified the pain point that would ultimately deliver votes to secure the presidency for the Democrats. 
I was 4 years old in 1992, so I don’t remember much from that year, yet that phrase, and..."

"It was the Hawkeye State that scuttled Hillary Clinton’s presidential ambitions in 2008. Iowa’s energetic caucus-goers were not moved by Clinton’s self-professed qualities of electability and inevitability, and they voted for both Barack Obama and John Edwards over the former first lady. Clinton learned that she would have to earn her party’s nomination that night, and the primary campaign that followed the Iowa caucuses would prove to be an intensely fought one. It was a fight, however, from which she was not fated to emerge victorious.
As Clinton is preparing..."
"All four members of “The Squad” fired back against former President Barack Obama’s criticism that the “defund the police” movement was just a “snappy slogan.”
Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) tweeted their responses to Obama, who said activists “lost a big audience” by pushing the movement for police reform.“We lose people in the hands of police. It’s not a slogan but a policy demand,” wrote Omar. “And centering the demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country gets..."

"The majority view among the U.S. intelligence community agencies is that COVID-19 is natural and accidentally leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, China, a senior intelligence official told the Daily Caller News Foundation.
While not all of the 17 agencies that make up the IC are fully behind the idea that the novel coronavirus was an accidental laboratory leak, most believe that to be the case, according to the senior official. The official added that the holdouts are still open to the possibility that the virus leaked from a..."

Mr Rubio earned 37.3 of the vote against 35.5 for Ohio Governor John..."
"If you happen to be watching cable news today as your primary source of keeping up to date on the election you might not have any idea that there are three primary elections going on. (Sort of.) The first primary is in the District of Columbia, but that’s a bit of a misnomer because it’s not really a primary, nor is it a caucus. DC doesn’t impact the GOP in the general election because the Republicans know they won’t even get 10% of the vote, but they do get to..."
"Chances are likely slim, but what about a Donald Trump-Bernie Sanders debate heading into the crucial June 7 California primary?
That possibility surfaced Wednesday, even if in a jocular tone, in an indirect exchange between the Republican billionaire real estate mogul and the senator who Hillary Clinton hasn't been able to bump from the Democratic presidential sweepstakes."
"The Supreme Court is set to hear a major abortion case that will give the justices an opportunity to reconsider the precedent set by the landmark Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey decisions.
The Court on Monday announced in an order that it would take the case involving a Mississippi law passed in 2018 that bans abortions after 15 weeks with limited exceptions.
The law was blocked by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as under existing precedent, states may not ban abortions before fetal viability, which..."

"President Joe Biden falsely claimed Wednesday that the US had ""zero inflation"" in July just hours after federal Consumer Price Index data showed annual inflation dropped only marginally to 8.5 percent, still near a four-decade high.
Biden said at legislation signing in the White House, ""I just want to say a number: zero.""
""Today, we received news that our economy had 0 percent inflation in the month of July,  0 percent,"" Biden added. ""Here’s what that means: while the price of some things go up. went up last month, the price of other..."

One, he is an incumbent. Incumbent presidents have won 14 of 19 reelection bids since 1900.

"The global coronavirus outbreak might accomplish something that myriad bad polls haven't: make Republicans fear losing the 2020 presidential election.
Until now, survey after survey has consistently shown President Trump losing to the Democrats in November. Like, to all of the Democrats. Yet Republicans have remained confident. They remember how the #FakePolls showed Trump losing to Hillary Clinton four years ago. More importantly, perhaps, GOPers have a deep faith that the strong economy will provide a powerful tailwind to Trump's re-election campaign.

The unemployment rate declined to 3.5% from 3.6% in October, matching a half-century low, the Labor Department reported Friday. And wages rose a solid 3.1% in November compared with a year earlier.
The healthy job gain runs against a widespread view that businesses are struggling to find workers with unemployment so low. Persistent hiring should help keep consumers spending - a key engine of..."

"President Trump's State of the Union Address was, for the most part, quite conservative -- and, I suspect, quite effective with viewers. Whether it will have any lasting impact remains to be seen, but I'd be surprised, given the hyperdrive pace of today's news cycles and the president's uncanny ability to step on his own message."

"The acting director of the federal Bureau of Prisons has been removed from his position more than a week after millionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein took his own life while in federal custody.
Attorney General William Barr announced Hugh Hurwitz’s reassignment Monday. Hurwitz had served as the agency’s acting director since May 2018.
No reason was given for the reassignment, but the move comes as the bureau faces increased scrutiny after Epstein’s suicide August 10 at a New York jail.
Hurwitz will now return to his role as Assistant Director of..."
"All night long, almost every candidate on stage aimed their attacks at Joe Biden. Early on, Kamala Harris referred to him as “Senator Biden,” a perhaps not-so-accidental demotion. Julian Castro, Bill de Blasio, and Cory Booker all went after him in rapid succession. Even Kirsten Gillibrand claimed that Biden opposed women working outside the home, a particularly implausible accusation.
Here’s the good news for Biden: If tonight doesn’t do any damage to his numbers, he will probably cruise to the nomination. This is life as the frontrunner – you get..."
"On Sunday evening, demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd defaced and toppled a statue of Confederate officer Charles Linn, which had stood in a public park in Birmingham, Alabama, since being installed in 2013 by a charity.
The destruction of this Confederate monument is but one in a sequence of such vandalisms that have swept the nation’s southern states in the past week. The Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Birmingham was defaced before authorities disassembled and relocated it. A Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi campus..."
"President Donald Trump is heading to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to talk to the police and responders helping curb and clean up after the violent protests to ""increase enthusiasm"" and ""love and respect for our country.""
""That's why I am going, because they did a fantastic job,"" Trump told reporters Monday during the daily press briefing. ""As soon as a I called and told them, 'let's go,' the whole problem stopped.
""That was, what, 6 days ago.""
Trump also offered an explanation for why he had no plans to speak with Jacob..."
"President Trump’s oldest son defended on Sunday his father’s reelection chances amid flagging poll numbers and criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s economic plan as “asinine.”
Speaking on “Sunday Morning Futures,” Donald Trump Jr. blamed the president’s drop in the polls on the media coverage Trump has received recently – saying news outlets have been critical of the president while ignoring going after Biden.
“I think when you have the media onslaught where media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides,” Trump Jr. said...."
"Planned Parenthood might as well stop wasting money on public-relations officials and marketing campaigns, because media outlets are only too willing to do their dirty work for free.
In the wake of Planned Parenthood’s choice to withdraw from the Title X family planning program over a Trump-administration rule prohibiting providers from performing or referring for abortions, the New York Times editorial board rushed to the group’s defense.
“It Just Got Harder to Get Birth Control in America,” declares the headline, and the subhead is hardly more accurate: “Title X made..."
"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday is set to touch down in Texas to cast a bright light on what he sees as the Biden administration’s failed approach to illegal immigration and the “humanitarian crisis” that is playing out in his absence.
Mr. Trump is slated to join Gov. Greg Abbott and law enforcement officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety in Weslaco, tour an unfinished part of the border wall and participate in a town hall meeting with supporters.
It marks the latest stop in what could be described as an “I told you so” tour that has..."
"Just when we thought CNN couldn't get any more pathetic, they prove us wrong...again. The network on Tuesday announced their climate change town hall. The debate, scheduled for Sept. 4th will be seven hours long. Yes, seven hours. The reason? The network wants to give each of the 10 candidates ample time to respond to questions during this ""unprecedented prime-time event.""
Each of the 10 candidates will be given 40 minutes to discuss their plans to address climate change. Hosts Wolf Blitzer, Erin Burnett, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo and Don..."
"President-elect Joe Biden is bracing for a busy first 10 days as the next commander in chief, according to his future White House chief of staff.
Ron Klain, who is returning to the role after serving as Biden's chief staffer when he was vice president, foreshadowed Biden's priorities Saturday after he will be inaugurated on Wednesday.
In a memo to incoming senior staff that was shared with reporters, Klain outlined how Biden would sign a series of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies addressing the coronavirus pandemic,..."
"Facebook has held a monopoly over personal social networking for the past decade, according to a beefed-up antitrust suit by the Federal Trade Commission filed Thursday. 
The FTC’s amended suit, which comes two months after a federal judge dismissed an earlier version, seeks to force Facebook to restructure or sell off assets including Instagram and WhatsApp that it says help the company squash competition. 
“Facebook holds monopoly power in the provision of personal social networking in the United States and has held such power continuously since at least 2011,” the..."
"The Republican National Convention’s third night was largely geared toward one group: black voters.
The GOP featured several black speakers who could speak to the hardship and bigotry that many black people in the United States faced (and still do face) unjustly. Former NFL player Burgess Owens (whose great-great-grandfather was brought to the U.S. as a slave) spoke about growing up in the Jim Crow era, when segregation threatened to cripple his opportunity and take away his freedoms. And then, there was Clarence Henderson, who was arrested during a sit-in..."
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin on Sunday said he would oppose his party’s sprawling voting rights bill — because he believes it would divide the country.
In an op-ed in his home state’s Gazette-Mail, the moderate Manchin announced his rejection of the Democrat-pushed For the People Act — known as S1 — which is stalled in the Senate after the House green-lit it in March along party lines.
“Today’s debate about how to best protect our right to vote and to hold elections … is not about finding common ground, but seeking partisan advantage,”..."
"As expected, Hillary Clinton's anticlimactic acceptance speech capped off a Democratic convention at which two of the weakest primetime speeches were delivered by the the two members of the nominated ticket. There were powerful moments earlier in the evening -- including an impactful address by the father of a Muslim US soldier who paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country in Iraq, and an address from a valorous Medal of Honor recipient, who was shamefully heckled by some DNC delegates."
"The mainstream media were up in arms Tuesday over Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, signing a new law limiting girls' sports at public schools to biological girls.
Liberal media outlets were outraged with DeSantis' public signing of the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, which he said would help protect equal opportunities for women to obtain college athletic scholarships. Reporters appeared to take personal offense with the fact that the bill was signed into law June 1, the first day of Pride Month.

"President Biden announced Friday he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom next week to 17 individuals including ex-lawmaker and gun control activist Gabby Giffords, the late Sen. John McCain, Trump critic Khizr Khan, Olympic athlete Simone Biles and Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington. 
Ms. Giffords, a former House lawmaker from Arizona, founded a gun-violence prevention group after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011. 
Mr. Khan is the Gold Star father who famously criticized then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016 at the Democratic National Convention, in a speech lambasting Mr. Trump’s..."
"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump in Miami, Florida Friday to unveil the White House’s new Cuba policy.
Rubio heaped praise on the president for showing compassion toward the Cuban people, who continue to struggle under the dictatorial leadership of Raul Castro. In multiple conversations the two had since the election, Rubio shared that Trump asked him constantly, “What are we going to do about Cuba?”"
"The Obama administration unexpectedly announced two new gun control measures on Thursday, including one that would curb the import of military surplus weapons -- in a move that could anger collectors.
Vice President Biden announced the new measures Thursday morning. The new rules, announced while Washington was otherwise focused on the crisis in Syria, took the form of executive actions, which President Obama added to the list of 23 steps the White House already determined the president could take on his own.
The steps come after Congress declined..."

Gorbachev spent decades working up the ranks of the Soviet Communist Party, becoming the country’s leader in 1985 when he..."
"President Biden is set to announce that he’s shaving about two weeks off his May 1 deadline for states to make all adults eligible for coronavirus vaccines.
A White House official confirms Biden plans to announce that every adult in the U.S. will be eligible to be vaccinated by April 19. Biden will make the announcement at the White House on Tuesday following a visit to a vaccination site in Virginia.
States have been gradually expanding eligibility beyond such priority groups as seniors and essential front-line workers.

The DOJ announced the review as President Biden and first lady Jill Biden..."
"Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert on Monday sued Vice President Mike Pence in a last-ditch effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
Gohmert's federal suit, which anticipates the House of Representatives' Jan. 6 certification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College win, seeks to give Pence ""exclusive authority"" over which votes are deemed certifiable. In his complaint, Gohmert argues that since competing sets of electors cast votes calling the election for President Trump, Pence should have the ""sole discretion"" to determine the legitimacy of votes, per the 12th Amendment.
Gohmert added..."
"Talk about too close for comfort.
The National Park Service (NPS) is urging visitors to practice safe social distancing at parks that remain open during the coronavirus pandemic.
With the COVID-19 outbreak drastically disrupting daily life for millions of Americans, the great outdoors have become a welcome refuge for many. Inspired, Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt temporarily suspended all park entrance fees last week to make it easier for people to get outdoors. The decision is effective until further notice."
"The House passed legislation aimed at providing $28 million in emergency funding to the Food and Drug Administration to address the nation’s baby formula shortage in a 231-192 vote Wednesday.
The Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act, introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), includes language that looks to prevent “fraudulent products from entering the United States market” and prevent future shortfalls in supplies.
The shortage comes in the wake of one of the nation’s largest producers of infant formula, Abbott Nutrition, voluntarily recalling three types of its product after multiple babies contracted..."
"Without evidence, America’s corporate media spent weeks hoaxing the American public with the lie Capitol Hill Police Officer Brian Sicknick died after an anti-vote-fraud protester smashed him in the head with a fire extinguisher during the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
After the fire extinguisher hoax was debunked, the corporate media spread the lie that Sicknick probably died as a result of the riot, maybe from pepper spray or something."
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday issued an emergency authorization to use Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 through 11, coming days after an advisory panel recommended it.
But before the shots can be distributed across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must first sign off on the move.

"The Senate passed a bipartisan gun reform bill on Thursday in the wake of a slew of mass shootings in recent months, including the death of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas in late May.
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — negotiated by a group of senators led by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chris Murphy (R-CT) — looks to incentivize states to implement red flag laws. The proposal would make it easier for law enforcement to confiscate a firearm and block the purchase of a gun if an individual is deemed..."
"In the wake of the violent attack on Capitol Hill last week, at least three corporations have announced that they would suspend contributions to the campaigns of lawmakers who objected to the certification of Electoral College votes.
At least four protests were scheduled in Washington, D.C., for Wednesday, the day Congress was expected to count the votes of the Electoral College and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Those protests descended into chaos as demonstrators breached the congressional building — smashing windows, breaking into offices, and looting rooms.
Before the demonstrations..."
"The Biden administration will ask U.S. attorneys appointed by President Trump to resign from their posts, but the prosecutor overseeing the tax probe tied to Hunter Biden, the president’s son, will remain in place, a senior Justice Department official told Fox News late Monday.
The fate of U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who runs the office in Delaware, has been the source of some speculation. It is standard procedure for new presidents to ask for the resignation of all U.S. attorneys once they enter the office. But Fox News peppered the..."
"American Jews were the religious group most targeted by hate crimes in 2019, the FBI reported Monday, facing more than 60 percent of anti-religious bias incidents.
The number of anti-Semitic hate-crime incidents rose 14 percent in 2019, data from the bureau's annual hate-crime statistical report show, with police departments reporting 953 events and 1,032 victims. That is 82 more incidents than in 2018, continuing a rising trend over the past half decade.

"The White House announced Thursday that President Biden will take action to pardon about 6,500 people convicted federally for marijuana possession and thousands more under DC local law.
He is also ordering federal agencies to consider changing pot’s Schedule I categorization that lumps it together with such drugs as heroin and LSD.
It is one of the largest mass pardons in history and the subsequent federal review could move the country toward national legalization after 19 states and DC moved to allow the recreational use of the drug under local..."
"Former President Donald Trump released a 12-page rebuttal Monday in response to evidence presented at the January 6 hearings, likening it to a ""Kangaroo Court"" to distract the American people before the November midterm elections. 
""Our nation is SUFFERING. Our economy is in the gutter. Inflation is rampant. Gas prices have reached an all-time high. Ships are unable to unload cargo. Families cannot get needed baby formula. We are an embarrassment around the world,"" Trump said in the rebuttal, released through his Save America PAC. 
Trump accused Democrats of being fixated on the..."

"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer is barreling toward a vote set for Wednesday on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, despite lawmakers having not finished writing the proposal.
The New York Democrat scheduled the vote on a legislative shell, saying they would add in later the details of the infrastructure spending and how to pay for it.

"President Trump on Wednesday predicted the U.S. Supreme Court may decide the outcome of November's presidential election, highlighting the importance he's put on the Senate quickly confirming his eventual nominee.
In order to prevent a four-four split on a potential election-related issue, Trump suggested during a roundtable event that lawmakers should take swift action on his candidate, who is expected to be announced on Saturday.
“I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,” Trump told reporters. “And I think it's very important that we have nine justices.”"
"The U.S. murder rate increased nearly 30% in 2020, according to the FBI, making that the largest percentage increase in modern U.S. history with almost 5,000 more murders last year than the year before, although it is still down from heights reached during the violent 1990s.
The bureau released its Uniform Crime Report statistics on Monday and estimated there were 21,570 murders in the United States last year, an increase of 29.4% from 2019, with 4,901 additional murders in 2020. In raw numbers, 2020 saw more total murders than any year since 1995, when..."

"President Joe Biden had barely contained the delta COVID-19 variant when he slapped travel bans on South Africa and seven neighboring countries as he waits for more information regarding the new omicron strain.
But Biden's decision to close the U.S. border to southern African visitors has been blasted by travel lobby groups and attracted hypocrisy complaints after he seemed to suggest former President Donald Trump's travel bans were ""xenophobic.""
Biden's travel ban is ""symbolic,"" according to public health communications expert Glen Nowak. For Nowak, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman, movement..."
"President Biden imposed a travel ban on several African countries in the wake of the new strain of the coronavirus, the omicron variant, despite calling his predecessor ""racist"" and  ""xenophobic"" for imposing his own travel restrictions - a flashback the media has largely ignored. 
In 2017, then-President Trump imposed travel restrictions on six predominantly Muslim countries over concerns of improper vetting. Liberal media often referred to it as the ""Muslim ban."" When Covid began spreading throughout the world at the beginning of 2020, Trump would then block travel from China and six other countries, including..."

"The New York Times was accused on Sunday of ""glorifying"" cancel culture and ""celebrating teenage revenge narratives"" after publishing a piece that many readers feel lacked news value and celebrated a high school student's vengeance on a classmate.

"China has ratcheted up warnings to the US about a planned trip to Taiwan in August by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, even suggesting a possible military response, according to new reports.
The behind-the-scenes rhetoric was significantly stronger than the threats Beijing has made previously regarding US interaction with Taiwan, the Financial Times first reported Sunday, citing six people familiar with the private message to the Biden administration.
The warning signaled a possible military response, the Financial Times said.
While China has long insisted that Taiwan is a part of its territory,..."
What was important about Donald Trump’s much anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday is what he didn’t say. There was no mention by the self-declared Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee of his determination to build a wall between Mexico and the United States and get the Mexican government to pay for it.
"With the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many are asking how Big Tech companies will protect women's digital privacy. After all, some states are sure to enforce new abortion laws, and the reality behind everyone's modern digital trail could betray information about people going to get abortions.
""For years, privacy advocates have raised concerns about this massive data trove, full of private messages, political affiliations and even sensitive health data,"" the Washington Post notes. ""Now that type of information could be used to find, arrest and prosecute those getting or abetting abortions.""

"It seems like every day Democrats and their cronies in the corrupt corporate media concoct a new, bogus “threat to democracy” that they use to intimidate Americans out of voting for their political opponents.
These “threats” aren’t just overused, they are overexaggerated in an effort to cover up Democrats’ hypocrisy, mask their incompetence, and justify the targeting of their ideological enemies. Meanwhile, it’s the blue party that’s working overtime to erode and replace the actual democratic processes responsible for keeping our nation running.
Here is a list of everything Democrats..."
"An epidemic of workplace discrimination is sweeping the United States. It threatens not only people’s jobs and livelihoods, but the very structure of our civic life. It calls out for an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
The victims aren’t targeted over their race, sex, sexual orientation or even gender identity (that last category now being recognized as covered under the act by a recent decision of the Supreme Court). All those groups already have protection. The epidemic I’m talking about is workplace discrimination against people whose..."

"Of all the questions asked, words spoken, and ink spilled on the so-called “Capitol Siege” of January 6, 2021, none hold the key to the entire event quite like what Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked of Christopher Wray.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged Tuesday that he now expects high inflation to continue into the middle of 2022, stating that the government should no longer push what had been a recurring slogan of it being ""transitory.""
During a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell noted that when the Fed says ""transitory,"" they do not mean it as just referring to how long inflation will last, as the average person might expect. Still, he said it is time to stop using the word."

The execution came after the Supreme Court denied last-minute legal challenges from Bernard’s attorneys, who had argued that newly-discovered evidence suggested he did not play..."
"Floyd County fired its embattled election chief on Thursday, three days after a hand recount of the presidential race in Georgia's closely watched election audit turned up 2,600 previously uncounted votes.
The secretary of state's office initially asked Robert Brady to resign, which he did not do.
Floyd County's Board of Elections met Thursday afternoon and voted to terminate him. Officials cited at least two reprimands he had received in the past six months.
The initial error occurred because county election officials under Brady's watch had failed to upload votes..."
"About 20 million Americans turned out for the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. Lectures and rallies took place at more than 2,000 college campuses, 10,000 elementary and high schools, and thousands of other places across the country. Forty-two states adopted resolutions endorsing Earth Day, and Congress recessed so that legislators could participate in the activities in their districts. It is sometimes described as, up to that time, the largest public demonstration in history.
The lectures and literature surrounding the event featured lots of dismal predictions about the future...."
"Mexico's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with the White House to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through U.S. immigration courts, just hours after President Trump again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties."
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo violated federal and state laws by sexually harassing multiple women — including current and former state employees — through actions that included touching their “intimate body parts” without consent, officials said Tuesday.
Cuomo also allegedly retaliated against some of the victims and created a “toxic” and hostile work environment in the Executive Chamber, officials said.
The blockbuster announcements came during a news conference at which state Attorney General Letitia James said an independent probe she commissioned had found that Cuomo engaged in “unwanted groping, kissing, hugging and making inappropriate..."
"Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) whined on Monday about the possibility that she may not get a $4,500 pay raise — which she downplayed as only being a cost of living adjustment — as she compared members of Congress to minimum wage workers.
Fox News' Chad Pergram caught up with Ocasio-Cortez — who makes $174,000 per year —on Monday and asked her about the possibility that Congress would not get the pay raise."
"Sen. Lindsey Graham accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday of trying to thwart ongoing negotiations over a bipartisan infrastructure bill by scheduling an initial test vote before the measure’s text has been finalized.
“We’re not going to proceed to a bill that’s not written, because that makes no sense,” Graham (R-SC) told Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle.”"
"As expected, Speaker John Boehner has caved and now will support President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty.
On Tuesday, Boehner plans to bring to the floor of the House of Representatives a bill that funds Obama’s amnesty in its entirety for the rest of the fiscal year.
“Speaker John Boehner announced that the House will vote Tuesday on the Senate’s bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, a move that could enrage a small pocket of conservatives but will end the impasse over the agency’s funding,” Politico wrote in a..."
"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday made the case for a global minimum tax rate as she pushes President Biden's plan to increase levies on U.S. corporations in order to fund his $2.25 trillion spending proposal.
In a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Yellen called for global coordination on taxes paid by multinational corporations — part of an effort to crack down on companies that relocate in search of lower rates. Yellen's comments were first reported by Axios."
"Bill Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine who has emerged as a key figure of interest in the Trump impeachment inquiry, told Congress on Tuesday that there were ""two channels"" for Trump administration policymaking on Ukraine — ""one regular, one irregular.""
Taylor's testimony in a closed-door deposition before several House committees was described to Fox News by sources familiar with the session. The acting ambassador to Ukraine is seen as a key witness in the probe of whether President Trump was engaged in a ""quid pro quo"" by holding..."
"With ballot-harvesting, paper votes are collected by intermediaries who deliver them to polling officials, presumably increasing voter turnout but also creating opportunities for mischief.
America’s electoral obsession isn’t Russian meddling anymore. It’s ballot-harvesting, a long-disputed practice implicated in fraud that’s come to the fore with the nationwide embrace of absentee voting in recent years — and especially in last month’s midterms.
With ballot-harvesting, paper votes are collected by intermediaries who deliver them to polling officials, presumably increasing voter turnout but also creating opportunities for mischief.
The latter is suspected in..."
"Google may have a 'secret blacklist' of conservative news outlets, a former engineer at the company has claimed, which he says was exposed on Tuesday when certain websites briefly vanished from Google search results.
Mike Wacker, a Google engineer who was fired from the company in June 2019 amid a row over his conservative ideology, said the brief incident on Tuesday suggested a 'blacklist'.
'It appears to have revealed the existence of another blacklist that disproportionately targets conservatives,' Wacker told Mediaite.

"President Joe Biden rejected the notion Thursday that a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is inevitable once a complete U.S. military withdrawal is complete this summer. Still, the commander in chief, during a forceful explanation of his pullout plan, conceded it is ""highly unlikely"" the Afghan government retains ""unified"" control of its country.
Biden answered questions from reporters following remarks outlining the new Aug. 31 withdrawal completion target and said while he doesn't ""trust"" the Taliban, he is confident the Afghan government and U.S.-trained security force there will be able to overcome the worse-equipped, smaller..."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday blasted the preliminary nuclear deal struck between Iran, the U.S. and other countries last week, saying the agreement not only endangers Israel but also will enable Iran to build a “terror machine” capable of conquering the Middle East.
Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Netanyahu — who has been the chief critic of the agreement — said lifting economic sanctions on Iran will lead to disas"
"We’re waiting for hard news on the possible entry of Vice President Joe Biden into the race for the White House. Our own Ed Henry says his sources say the VP will get into the race though the announcement could still be days away. The VP is polling third behind Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, but would shake up the race on the Democratic side."
"A second federal appeals court on Friday ruled against the Trump administration in its attempt to roll back the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said its decision to do so was unlawful.
A divided three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling that the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind the DACA program violated federal law because “it was not adequately explained and thus was arbitrary and capricious.”
The Richmond-based federal appeals court is the second appeals court to rule..."
"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced plans to begin slowing its aggressive bond-buying program by $15 billion a month in mid-November, the first step that policymakers will take in reversing a historic level of stimulus for the U.S. economy amid a recent inflation surge.
The Federal Open Market Committee said at the conclusion of its two-day policy-setting meeting this week that it would lower its monthly purchase of long-term Treasury bonds by $10 billion a month and monthly purchase of mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion a month, bringing the total November purchase to $105..."
"President Biden plans to tap Bridget Brink to serve as the US ambassador to Ukraine, two months after Russia launched its brutal invasion of the nation, the White House announced Monday.

"How many ""kinetic military actions"" will it take for war skepticism to stick with the American public?
A new poll by the Chicago Council of Foreign Affairs (CCFA) finds that 75 percent of Americans believe that North Korea—a hermit kingdom thousands of miles away that is unable to keep its people from starving, a country whose military budget is a 60th the size of America's—presents a critical threat to the United States. That's up from 55 percent two years ago."
"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer announced Tuesday a tentative framework for a $3.5 trillion party-line social welfare package, although it remains to be seen whether Democrats can unite behind the measure.
Mr. Schumer announced the deal after meeting with all 11 Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee. The panel will be responsible for shepherding the deal through the budget reconciliation process, which allows spending bills to pass via a simple majority of 51 votes in the evenly split Senate.
“The budget resolution with instructions will be $3.5 trillion,” said Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat...."

"Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano reacted to the Harvey Weinstein verdict on “America’s Newsroom” Monday, calling it a ""significant victory"" for the disgraced movie producer and a ""monumental setback"" for prosecutors.
Weinstein, 67, was convicted of first-degree commission of a criminal sexual act and third-degree rape but was acquitted of two more serious charges of predatory sexual assault, as well as first-degree rape. The charges Weinstein was convicted of carry a total sentence of up to 29 years in prison.
“He’s still facing serious time,"" Napolitano said...."
"The House delayed a vote on the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Thursday, as progressive Democrats refused to support the bill until Congress acts on a reconciliation package projected to cost $3.5 trillion.
An intraparty battle delayed the bipartisan infrastructure effort as progressives held out on supporting the bill in an effort to create leverage for passing the larger package, which includes climate-change initiatives, expansions of health care, public education, paid leave and child-care programs, as well as an array of tax increases. Moderate Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) and Joe Manchin..."
"If you love a constitutionally constrained federal government, President Trump’s latest budget request for Betsy DeVos's Department of Education will warm your heart. But there’s more to be done.
Let’s start with the best part: The budget would cut $6.1 billion in education spending overall and consolidate $19.4 billion worth of K-12 programs into simple block grants to states. That cuts federal strings off of a big chunk of education money, and doing so makes sense.
This would be much more in line with the education power the Constitution gives..."
"After a little over ten hours of deliberation, a jury on Tuesday found former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder,and second-degree manslaughter in relation to the death of George Floyd.
On May 25, Chauvin and three other officers arrested and detained Floyd after he allegedly gave counterfeit money at a convenience store. Following a struggle to get Floyd into the back of a police cruiser, viral video shows that Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck and back for nearly nine minutes to detain Floyd while awaiting..."
"The U.S. Supreme Court refused on Monday to hear a case from Boise, Idaho challenging a lower court ruling that permits homeless people to sleep on sidewalks and in public parks if there is not enough shelter space to house them.
The Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the case – which came without comment or a dissent – is a major win for homeless activists, but a blow to city officials across the west who argue that the ruling by a federal appeals court last year hinders their abilities..."
"A Taliban suicide blast in the center of Kabul has killed a U.S. soldier, a Romanian service member and at least 10 civilians near the headquarters of Afghanistan's international military force and the American embassy.
The American and Romanian service members killed on Thursday when the car bomb exploded were both NATO soldiers.

"Nancy Pelosi owns more than $500,000 in Apple stock, according to her financial disclosure reports. Pelosi is also the speaker of the House. Congressional Democrats and Republicans alike have introduced multiple antitrust bills that would affect Big Tech companies.
The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, called Pelosi personally in June and told her not to move ahead on these bills. The House Judiciary Committee passed six of these bills in June. Not one of them has seen movement on the House floor in six months, with some reports pinning the inaction on the speaker.
Back in January,..."
"Why is Labor Day so important to us?
That's a good question. Perhaps it's because Labor Day gives the American worker a chance to spend some additional quality time with friends, family and loved ones. It’s also, supposedly, the last day you’re allowed to wear white, and, as Karl Rove points out, it's “the unofficial start of the fall campaign season.”
These are all good things, or at least good things to know. But its true meaning and purpose is actually quite fascinating (via the US Department of Labor):

"After 19 years, justice has yet to be attained in the case against the plotters of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — and a year dominated by a global pandemic has pushed the start of the trial at Guantanamo Bay back even further.
Al Qaeda terrorists crashed hijacked planes into the World Trade Center buildings, the side of the Pentagon, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, but the five men believed to be responsible for the plot have yet to face a..."
"President Trump said he favors abortion laws that include exceptions for rape and incest, marking a break with Alabama Republicans, who recently enacted the strictest abortion ban in the nation.
“As most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother,” Trump tweeted late Saturday.
Trump said Republicans must stick together to win elections in 2020 and further the anti-abortion agenda."

"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Monday that it has granted full approval to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for individuals 16 years of age or older.
The vaccine approval is the fastest in the agency’s history, coming less than four months after Pfizer-BioNTech completed its “biologics license application” in May. The FDA had moved to clear the shot’s regulatory hurdles in record time, evaluating the company’s latest safety data and inspecting vaccine factories around the world, according to CBS News.

"President Joe Biden and Democrats may be celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month, but convincing members of the country's diverse Hispanic and Latino community to support them in the 2022 midterm elections will not be a party.
Hispanic and Latino voters, who surprised Florida and Texas Democrats last cycle, will be a critical demographic again in November, particularly in the toss-up Arizona and Nevada Senate races, which will determine the balance of power in Washington next year, along with the other competitive campaigns.
Republicans are proud of the party's improved standing..."
"Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is retiring, Fox News confirmed, setting President Biden up with the first opportunity to fill a vacancy on the high court. 
A source close to Breyer told Fox News that the justice will step down at the end of the current Supreme Court term early this summer.

Breyer was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Breyer's replacement will..."
"A House committee's report released Friday that exonerates the CIA, the military and Obama administration officials for their response to the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, is ""full of crap,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN Sunday.
The latest findings come from a declassified two-year investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, which looked at all sides of the incident, including claims that the White House cooked up phony talking points for then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice.
""I'm saying the House Intelligence Committee is doing a lousy job policing their..."
"Mitt Romney is calling former aides, donors and supporters from his 2012 campaign as he weighs launching a third presidential bid, a senior Romney aide told Fox News -- as the former Massachusetts governor also considers speaking at a Republican Party summit this week in California.
The developments, which follow the 2012 GOP presidential nominee telling donors last week he's considering a 2016 bid, show him inching ever-closer to a decision.
But sources close to Romney, who for months denied interest in another White House campaign, are pushing..."
"@Jack might want to update his password.
The personal account of Twitter’s chief executive Jack Dorsey was hacked Friday afternoon, which resulted in a barrage of bizarre and racist tweets from @jack — famous for sending out the first-ever tweet in March 2006.
At approximately 3:45 p.m., Dorsey’s account tweeted out “Shoutout Debut, Corey, NuBLoM, Joe, Owen, & Aqua,” apparently the names of a group of hackers calling themselves #ChucklingHella.
The account immediately went on to tweet out the N-word in all caps before adding: “intel is there’s a bomb..."
"The Senate passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act late Wednesday night. The measure passed with a unanimous vote of 96-0 and has a price tag of $2.2 trillion.
The Senate, however, failed to pass the Sasse Amendment which would prevent people from receiving more unemployment benefits than they would if they had a job. The vote was tied 48-48.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made it clear this would be the Senate's last opportunity to pass the bill before they go on recess until after..."
"Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled their ""Justice Act"" police reform legislation to hold officers accountable with an enhanced use-of-force database, pursue restrictions on chokeholds and create new commissions to study law enforcement and race.
Sen. Tim Scott, the lone African-American GOP senator, spearheaded the legislation in the wake of George Floyd's death and nationwide protests demanding racial justice -- including activists' calls to dismantle police departments. He framed the legislation as a bridge between law enforcement and communities of color."
"The British government has scrapped plans of cutting taxes on the wealthy, a move that prompted turmoil in financial markets and led to record lows for the pound.
Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng said Monday he would no longer pursue plans to eliminate the top 45% rate of income tax paid on earnings above 150,000 pounds, or $167,000 a year.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill despite warnings from top liberal Democrats they will vote against it.
Pelosi, a California Democrat, told reporters the $1.2 trillion bill that pays for roads, bridges, water projects, and broadband expansion is critical for the success of the economy and can no longer wait. The bill has languished since Senate passage over the summer due to protests from House liberals who want to pass the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better plan that will pay for a broad array..."
"Harvard University chemistry and engineering professor Charles Lieber was found guilty of lying about his ties to the Chinese government.

"House Republicans voted Thursday to block President Obama's immigration executive actions, though it was unclear whether the largely symbolic step would be enough to prevent a risky budget stand-off next week.
The House voted 219-197 for the bill, by Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., that declares Obama's actions ""null and void and without legal effect.""
The legislation is part of a three-step plan by House GOP leaders to both address Obama's immigration maneuvers and approve a new spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown. Next week, the chamber..."
"President Obama’s admirers continue to call for him to go to Ferguson, Mo. to make a “powerful, nuanced, careful case” on the subject of “relations between African Americans and police departments.” Yes, but what would he say? Unless the president has a proposed law or action to take on the subject, jawboning on the subject seems very unlikely to change many minds on the subject. If the much more fraught case of Trayvon Martin couldn’t change the national discourse, how is the Ferguson storyline going to do it? Obama’s supporters..."
"At 10:22 pm Monday night, the United States District Court for the Southern Division of Texas issued a temporary injunction enjoining the Department of Homeland Security from implementing ""any and all aspects of or phases of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans or Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program"" that President Obama announced on November 20, 2014.

The Food and Drug Administration just refused to recommend approval of Pfizer’s application to give the general public third COVID-vaccine doses.

"Some Democrats in critical battlegrounds worry that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is not campaigning vigorously enough in their states.
While Biden has taken a low-key approach to campaign across the country amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Democratic figures in Texas and North Carolina remarked that his method may not be enough to get him 270 electoral votes.
Gilberto Hinojosa, the chair of the Texas Democratic Party, called Biden’s limited campaigning due to the pandemic a “pretty lame excuse,” the Associated Press reported, arguing that campaigning in Hispanic-heavy states like..."
"The misleadingly named “Civics Secures Democracy Act” (CSDA) — just now reintroduced in Congress — will allow the Biden administration to push Critical Race Theory (CRT) on every public school in the country. Over a six-year period, this $6 billion pot of competitive grant money will create a de facto national curriculum — just like Common Core. States desperate to tap into the federal gravy train will have to tailor their civics and history grant proposals to the Biden administration’s liking. And abundant evidence shows that Biden’s Education Department is pushing CRT. So why..."
"Amy Coney Barrett withstood hours of questioning Tuesday with poise, civility, and at times, moments of humanity – countering the portrait of a right-wing extremist that Democrats have attempted to paint of President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, experts argued.
Jeffrey McCall, professor of communication at DePauw University, said Barrett's professional responses and pleasant demeanor have undercut the narrative pushed by Democrats that she is threatening or radical.
""Judge Barrett has had a most impressive day,"" McCall told Fox News. ""It is clear she is bright and sincere. Her..."
"C-Span host Steve Scully—a former intern for Democrat Joe Biden— reactivated his Twitter account but turned it private after claiming he was hacked when the account appeared to accidentally tweet a direct message from Scully to Trump foe Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci is a vocal Biden supporter.
Scully, a Democrat, was widely slammed because the message suggested that he was plotting with Scaramucci to attack President Trump at the now-canceled second presidential debate, which Scully was set to moderate. Many didn’t believe Scully’s claim that his account was hacked because he..."

The measure, which provides $25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service, passed by a vote of 257 to 150, including 26 Republican votes. The vote came on the heels of the Democrats' conspiracy theory that President Trump wants to hold the USPS hostage to improve his chances of winning his re-election in November."
"President Donald Trump said he might be ""immune"" to the coronavirus after he returned to the White House Monday evening, where he will continue his treatment for the disease.

“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,” the president tweeted. “It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”
The presidential election is fixed by law and could only be delayed by Congress changing the law. The Constitution decrees that the incumbent president’s term..."

"Who’s running for president? If you answered incumbent President Donald Trump and presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden, you’re wrong.
There are actually two additional candidates running for the presidency, though Democrats across the country are desperately trying to keep this fact hidden.
One of these two candidates, Libertarian Party nominee Jo Jorgensen, is hellbent on convincing the Commission on Presidential Debates to allow her to participate in the highly anticipated 2020 debates."

"Sen. Rand Paul is pushing legislation that would ban revenue from being used for anything but paying interest on the debt, meeting Social Security requirements, and paying military salaries.
In an interview Thursday evening with Fox News' Sean Hannity, the Kentucky Republican suggested that would be a better way than threatening a government shutdown to force the president into negotiating significant spending cuts as the deadline nears in February for extending the nation's debt limit.
He said it would also be a safer approach, given the uneasiness of the markets..."
"President Biden on Monday authorized emergency measures to boost supplies for the American solar power industry in an effort to address his climate change-fighting goals and fight escalating costs. 
To that end, the White House announced a two-year pause in tariffs on solar panels from Southeast Asia amid complaints by industry groups that the solar sector is being slowed by supply chain problems and a Commerce Department inquiry into possible trade violations involving Chinese products.

"With little more than a week before a budget stalemate over Obamacare sets off a government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans dug in deeper Sunday, with lawmakers increasingly looking, pre-emptively, to pin blame on the other side.
Democrats insist that the GOP-led effort to strip funding from Obamacare remains a nonstarter, while Republicans contend that any government shutdown will be President Obama’s fault."
"It’s a fine line between a general election shift and the dreaded ‘Etch A Sketch.’
Donald Trump’s supporters give him broad latitude on issues and even his promise of an attitudinal change. For example, his suggestion that the Republicans should become a pro-choice party likely wrinkled few brows among his core supporters."
"Jobless claims soared to 3.28 million in the past week, the Labor Department said Thursday, as the coronavirus outbreak affected wide portions of the economy.

Most economists had forecast about 1.5 million people filing for unemployment benefits.

"Predictably, President Biden has had nothing meaningful to say about the outrageous, criminal leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion, but he has been quick to demagogue the justices in the putative Court majority for overturning Roe and Casey, as well as Republicans and abortion opponents. What’s at stake, the president says, is “about a lot more than abortion,” and he warned that “this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization in recent American history.”
Putting aside that widespread, vibrant opposition to the taking of unborn life long predates the political emergence of Donald Trump and his..."
"In the latest Democratic presidential debate, oversimplification struck again.
Hillary Clinton spoke of fixing ""glitches"" in President Barack Obama's health care law to address rising costs, skimming over deeper issues on matters of affordability and the Affordable Care Act.

\‘It’s the unspoken Biden formula,” reports Axios. “Talk like a rosy bipartisan; act like a ruthless partisan.”
Indeed, it is. And to this maxim we might add a few others. Talk like a moderate; act like a radical. Talk about normality; act like a revolutionary. And, at all stages, aggressively hide the ball. Progressive pundits have taken to saying that Biden poses a problem for conservatives because he is so “boring.” That’s one way..."
"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to Saudi Arabia on Sunday where he met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Israeli media reported Monday.
Netanyahu’s visit only lasted a few hours and marks the first official trip of its kind. He traveled to the city of Neom and was accompanied by Israel’s Mossad chief Yossi Cohen. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu and Cohen met with Pompeo and bin Salman possibly to discuss matters related to Iran and normalization.

"During an April 2 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News, Surgeon General Jerome Adams compared deaths caused by COVID-19 to deaths caused by smoking and drug abuse. ""More people will die, even in the worst projections, from cigarette smoking in this country than are going to die from coronavirus this year,"" he said.
Wallace questioned the analogy. ""Dr. Adams,"" he said, ""there's a big difference between opioids and cigarettes, which are something that people decide to use or not to use, [and] the coronavirus, which people catch. It's not..."
"Donald Trump was focusing on veterans Sunday at the annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle rally.
The Memorial Day weekend event, which got its start in 1988, also honors members of the military missing in action.
Motorcyclists began their procession from the Pentagon, crossed the Potomac River and rode around the National Mall, ending up at a rally by the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial."
Tensions between the U.S. government and its allies continued to flare amid reports that the National Security Agency monitored phone calls of 35 world leaders -- this after Germany's government summoned the U.S. ambassador to account for allegations that the agency may have targeted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone.
"Glenn Greenwald founded The Intercept in 2013 with the explicit goal of creating a news outlet that would be insulated from the partisan and financial pressures inherent to corporate media.
As he acknowledges in a resignation letter published Thursday, that project has ultimately failed.
The Intercept’s editors, who Greenwald notes repeatedly are almost all based in New York, forbade him from publishing a column airing well-documented allegations of Biden family corruption. They told him that he couldn’t publish the piece as written at The Intercept, supposedly in violation of his..."
"China’s Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing and Washington have agreed in principle to roll back existing tariffs in phases if trade talks between the two countries move forward.
Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said both sides had agreed to simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other’s goods, CNBC reported, citing the Chinese state broadcaster.
Both sides were closer to a so-called “phase one” trade agreement after constructive negotiations over the past two weeks, he added.

"President Donald Trump is pushing back on a weekend report that claimed his administration could have acted sooner to control the coronavirus in the United States, calling it ""fake news"" and retweeting a message that called on him to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci from his virus task force.
On Sunday, Fauci — the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — told CNN that there was ""pushback"" to suggestions in February that the Trump administration should enact social distancing guidelines as cases of COVID-19 started to show..."

On Thursday, the Massachusetts senator will reportedly tell her staff in a call that she will be dropping out of the race and deliver a formal announcement later in the day.
The Massachusetts senator, 70, staked her candidacy on broad left-wing proposals such as a wealth tax on millionaires and billionaires, breaking up Big Tech companies, and forgiving student loan debt. Her plethora of policy proposals led to ""I..."

Officers were first called after reports of gunfire at the facility near Indianapolis International Airport after 11 p.m., police spokesperson Genae Cook said early Friday morning.
The incident was ""very short"" and ""probably only lasted one to two minutes,"" the deputy chief of criminal investigations for Indianapolis police Craig McCartt said, adding that a suspect might have exited his vehicle and began firing on the building.

"The economy beat expectations by adding 916,000 new jobs in March while the unemployment rate dropped to 6% as businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
Forecasters had anticipated some 647,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs.
Demand for labor has increased as stores, restaurants, and other businesses keep emerging from the year-long slump brought on by pandemic restrictions. More and more people are getting vaccinated for COVID-19, the major factor at play in how quickly the economy can regain its pre-pandemic footing.
The growth also..."
"Former President Trump, giving his first speech in Washington since leaving office, attacked soft-on-crime policies on Tuesday for leading to a national wave of violence in many U.S. cities, and said police must be allowed to do their jobs.
“Under the Democrat rule, in Democrat-run cities, Democrat-run states and a Democrat-run federal government, the criminals have been given free rein more than ever before. There’s never been a time like this,” Mr. Trump told the America First Policy Institute summit at a Washington hotel.
He said American streets “are riddled..."
"A federal judge threw out House Democrats’ lawsuit seeking an injunction against President Trump’s use of military funds for a border wall.
Washington, D.C., district court Judge Trevor McFadden said the fight is ultimately a political one “because the Constitution grants the House no standing to litigate these claims.""
""This case presents a close question about the appropriate role of the Judiciary in resolving disputes between the other two branches of the Federal Government. To be clear, the court does not imply that Congress may never sue the Executive..."
"White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci and Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul engaged in yet another explosive exchange at a Senate hearing Tuesday.
Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walensky were testifying before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions about the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 response. Paul began to ask Fauci why he had attempted to suppress the lab-leak theory by dismissing the work of various scientists who were exploring the possibility, and Fauci got fired up in response.

"The U.S. Intelligence Community warned President Trump in early 2020 that the Chinese Communist Party was downplaying the real threat posed by the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has since become a pandemic with more than 300,000 confirmed cases around the world.
The Trump administration was advised in January and February that Chinese officials “appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak” and “were not being candid about the true scale of the crisis,” according to a report Friday by the Washington Post."
"President Trump threatened to withhold funding from Michigan after he alleged that the state sent absentee ballots to all registered voters.
""Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,"" the president tweeted Wednesday morning.

"The number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits fell to the lowest number since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Labor Department.
Data released Thursday showed 684,000 Americans filed first-time jobless claims in the week ended March 20. Analysts surveyed by Refintiv were expecting 730,000 filings. The prior week’s reading was revised up by 11,000 to 781,000.

"The Trump administration’s chief border enforcement official cast doubt on the administration’s goal of completing construction of the southern border wall by 2021, throwing cold water on one of the Trump campaign’s major promises heading into next year’s election.
“It’s hard right now to say whether we’re still going to meet that goal,” Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner Mark Morgan said in an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday. “But I’m confident we’re going to be close.”"
"President Biden‘s immigration bill cancels penalties for future illegal immigrants, speeds legalization of those already here and increases legal immigration levels. But the bill, which lawmakers will officially introduce on Capitol Hill on Thursday, backtracks on new border security and worksite enforcement compromises that have long been seen as key parts of any serious attempt to overhaul the immigration system.
A senior administration official acknowledged that was intentional.
“This is not a bipartisan bill,” the official told reporters in previewing the legislation.
The Biden plan checks off most of the..."
"Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris will face off on Wednesday for the first and only vice presidential debate during the 2020 campaign. But if history is any guide and people continue to vote the top of the ticket, the debate won't change much.
An analysis published by Gallup in 2012 declared that the median change following vice presidential debates in 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2008 was 1 percentage point.
""None of the eight vice presidential debates occurring from 1976 to 2008 appears to have meaningfully altered..."

"While many Democrat senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee focused their 30 minutes of public questioning time for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on attacking her for signing a pro-life document or political posturing about pre-existing conditions within Obamacare, one senator pivoted from the coordinated narrative to ask Barrett an unprecedented question.
Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii paused lecturing Barrett about the dangers of the Supreme Court overruling the Affordable Care Act to ask her if she has a history with sexual harassment and assault.

"The House on Thursday voted largely along party lines to approve a non-binding War Powers resolution aimed at limiting President Trump’s ability to take military action against Iran.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the move was necessary after the drone attack that killed Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general, and Trump’s subsequent threats to escalate the conflict. “We have no illusions about Iran, no illusions about Soleimani, who was a terrible person,” she said.
“But it’s not about how bad they are, it’s about how good we are, protecting the people..."

"If you don’t like Mike Bloomberg, Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders, Super Tuesday night is just delightful so far.
For the past few months, Americans have been living in a fascinating political-science experiment: how far could a campaign carry an uninspiring candidate with essentially unlimited spending and TV ads? Tonight, we got the answer: not very far at all! Bloomberg spent a half-billion dollars to win American Samoa and a handful of delegates here and there across 15 states. It is the most expensive failure in American political history. The..."
"President Obama faced some tough questions at the G-20 summit from Antalya, Turkey, Monday as he addressed the tragedy in Paris and how the United States plans to respond.
Have you ""underestimated"" ISIS' ability? one reporter demanded.
“No, we haven’t,” Obama said. “There has been acute awareness from my administration from the start” regarding the threat, he insisted.
Many would disagree. Mere hours before terrorists murdered 129 people in Paris, Obama said ISIS had been “contained.”"

"On days celebrating the environment like Earth Day, celebrities and politicians like to lecture average Americans about how they need to change their behavior to fight climate change. However, they often fail to practice what they preach. 
Over the years, liberal politicians and celebrities have been accused of hypocrisy for failing to live by the eco-friendly lifestyles they advocate. Here are several examples of Hollywood A-listers, tech billionaires, and Democrat politicians who have been caught being hypocrites when it comes to helping the environment.

"Joe Biden used his much hyped public address on the coronavirus pandemic to take political shots at President Donald Trump.
The former vice president, who looks to be a shoe-in for the Democrat nomination, unveiled his proposal for containing the virus on Thursday in a speech that was billed by supporters as commander-in-chief-worthy. Neither Biden nor the speech, in fact, lived up to that hype. Instead of urging unity and calm in the face of the growing pandemic, Biden took the opportunity to lambast Trump for ignoring science, having an..."

"Attorney General Eric Holder was just months into the job when he announced plans to prosecute the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks and other alleged co-conspirators in a New York courtroom, rather than through the Guantanamo Bay military commission process.
It was an audacious idea, but immediately beset by political opposition and public safety concerns. The Obama administration's eventual decision to walk away from the proposal was a stinging defeat for Holder and a reminder of the complexities of the legal fight against terrorism.

"Federal officers cleared Black Lives Matter demonstrators from Lafayette Park near the White House in June 2020 in order to install fencing, not to make way for a photo-op for President Trump, the Inspector General for the Department of the Interior said on Wednesday.
Trump critics have alleged that the former president ordered the clearing of the area in order to pose for a photograph outside the adjacent St. John’s Church. Black Lives Matter activists claim that Trump ordered the clearing of demonstrators in an ongoing lawsuit against the Justice Department."

Some 300 attendees from 12 states have tested positive for coronavirus after attending the rally, including at least one who died.
And while it’s unclear how many people those infected attendees then spread the virus to, South Dakota saw a 35 percent post-rally..."
"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Wednesday the government will formally withdraw an extradition bill that sparked months of demonstrations, bowing to one of the protesters’ demands in the hope of ending the increasingly violent unrest.
But lawmakers warned that the bill’s withdrawal was not enough to end the turmoil, which has increasingly focused on alleged police brutality against protesters and democratic reforms.
The bill would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials. It has prompted massive protests since June that disrupted transport..."
"Obamacare faces a three-judge panel Tuesday in New Orleans that will weigh whether the healthcare law is unconstitutional.
The timing of the case means that a decision from the court, and a potential appeal to the Supreme Court after that, could bring Obamacare's future to the center of political debate ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Such an outcome would put President Trump on the spot to argue his vision for an alternative while congressional Democrats would accuse Republicans of being uncommitted to Obamacare's protections for the sick, as they..."
"Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis responded Wednesday to a White House attack from President Biden, who demanded he and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ""help or get out of the way"" of administration efforts to mitigate the coronavirus.
On ""The Ingraham Angle"", DeSantis said Biden is being disingenuous in blaming conservative governors who have refused to engage in widespread socioeconomic restrictions in regard to COVID mitigation, because the president continues to allow throngs of COVID-infected migrants to surge into Texas and in several cases be flown or bused to many states across the country – often without notifying..."
"Seven Capitol Police officers filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing former President Donald Trump and supporters of planning what led to the Jan. 6 attack in Washington D.C.
The suit ranks as the most expansive civil effort to date seeking to hold Trump and his allies legally accountable for the Capitol assault, The New York Times reported.
Although three similar lawsuits were filed in recent months, Thursday's filing is the first to allege that Trump worked in concert with political organizers to promote voter fraud in the 2020 election.

"To all who serve in the world’s greatest deliberative body and believe it must live up to that description: Don't let history’s verdict be a question mark or an asterisk.
The framers of the Constitution purposely and thoughtfully put the solemn responsibility of impeachment trials in the hands of the Senate, where they envisioned people of courage and conviction weighing facts and evidence.
I worry that the Senate is falling short of its responsibility. So far, the Senate has declined to seek further evidence and papers, on a party line..."

It was 22 years ago that Florida became the butt of the nation's and the world's joke because of the worst election debacle in modern history.

Then came hand recounts and controversies about undervotes and the means lawful to divine voter intention. Everyone in America learned what the word ""chad"" means and mastered a new..."

The document summarizes an FBI interview conducted in 2015 with a Saudi man applying for U.S. citizenship who had frequent contact with other Saudi nationals in the U.S. who provided ""significant logistical support"" to the first hijackers arriving in the..."
"The number of jobless workers who applied for unemployment benefits last week was 2.4 million, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
Economists had projected 2.4 million new jobless claims.
The number of workers seeking aid remains historically high but has dropped considerably from the nearly 7 million claims that were filed the week ending March 28. Still, losing millions of jobs a week for weeks at a time was unheard of before the pandemic, and some economists expected that jobless claims would drop more precipitously.

"THE BIG IDEA: Republicans are all Keynesians now, but not Rand Paul. As he forced a brief government shutdown overnight to draw attention to his party’s hypocrisy on deficit spending, Kentucky’s junior senator was the personification of William F. Buckley’s definition of conservatism: standing athwart history, yelling stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it."
Katie reported the bombshell Thursday that FBI Director James Comey had decided not to pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton long before their email investigation had expired. Transcripts released by the Senate Judiciary Committee showed that Comey had made up his mind even before interviewing key witnesses.
"Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar took aim at Dr. Rick Bright as he was still testifying on Capitol Hill.
Bright had claimed that he was removed from his post as the head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority due to his objections over touting the use of hydroxychloroquine, and testified Thursday that he had been moved to a “more limited and less impactful position” within the National Institutes of Health.
Azar, who spoke briefly to reporters before boarding Marine One at the White House, argued that..."
"The Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, along with Poland, Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, are all watching Vladimir Putin’s military buildup in eastern Europe with great unease. Each of them was controlled by Russia during its previous incarnation as the Soviet Union, and none of them wishes to return to that subjugation. That’s why they originally sought membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and have increased their own defense spending to meet, and in some cases surpass, the 2-percent-of-GDP goal that the alliance first agreed upon in 2014. NATO membership brings with it the guarantee..."
"President Donald Trump never misses an opportunity to depict unauthorized immigrants—especially of the Hispanic variety—as ""rapists and criminals."" He did it again in his State of the Union address when he drew attention to two Long Island teenage girls killed by the El Salvadorian gang MS13. Those deaths are tragic, but they don't say much one way or the other about the propensity of these immigrants to commit crimes."
"President Trump declared Thursday ""a great day for civilization"" as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced terms of a cease-fire agreement that would end violence between Turkey and Kurds in Syria, following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara.
The deal is for a 120-hour cease-fire, during which time the Kurdish-led forces could pull back from the roughly 20-mile-wide safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border. All Turkish military operations under the recent offensive known as Operation Peace Spring will pause during that..."
"Tens of thousands of people marched to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and down the National Mall on Saturday, commemorating the 50th anniversary of King's famous speech and pledging that his dream includes equality for gays, Latinos, the poor and the disabled.
The event was an homage to a generation of activists that endured fire hoses, police abuse and indignities to demand equality for African Americans. But there was a strong theme of unfinished business."
"Iranian officials on Friday denied reports from American and European intelligence agencies that the country shot down a civilian passenger plane shortly after attacking U.S. positions in Iraq.
Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 from Tehran to Kyiv was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile battery, according to U.S. officials. President Trump suggested on Thursday that the incident was the result of an error, saying “somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.”
“What is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile..."

"Former Florida governor and likely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush identified himself as Hispanic on a 2009 voter registration form, The New York Times has revealed.
The Times reports that the application, obtained from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department, shows that Mr. Bush marked himself “Hispanic” in the field labeled “race/ethnicity.”
Under Florida law, voter registration applications must be submitted in hard copy and require an original signature, because the voter is swearing or affirming an oath, The Times reported.

"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced a proposal on April 1 that would ban COVID-19 vaccination mandates as well as so-called vaccine passports.
The We Will Not Comply Act would ban documents that show who has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for the CCP virus. The concept of requiring certification has been rejected by pro-privacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Greene’s measure likely won’t be taken up by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, and if it is, it will be unlikely to pass. It would..."

The cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate theft of its emails determined earlier this year the hacking came from the Fancy Bear group, believed to be affiliated with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. The FSB is the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB."

"The Biden administration will be funding a federal program which it says aims to reduce diseases and cut drug use overall.
The program includes the controversial distribution of ""safe smoking kits"" — or crack pipes. The Department of Health and Human Services grant program is set to begin in May, and applications closed on Monday. It will provide $30 million to nonprofits and local governments for multiple purposes, including education and counseling for drug addicts.

"Nearly 1.2 million laid-off Americans applied for state unemployment benefits last week, evidence that the coronavirus keeps forcing companies to slash jobs just as a critical $600 weekly federal jobless payment has expired.
The Labor Department’s report Thursday marked the 20th straight week that at least 1 million people have sought jobless aid. Before the pandemic hit hard in March, the number of Americans seeking unemployment checks had never surpassed 700,000 in a week, not even during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
The new jobless claims were down by 249,000..."

"President Trump signed an order Friday expanding his travel ban to six new countries, targeting nations the government says pose a threat because they don’t issue electronic passports or don’t do enough to share information with American authorities to vet their citizens looking to travel.
The six countries are Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. They join seven countries who are still part of the president’s previous travel ban: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen."

The current coronavirus mortality rate in the United States is nowhere near what it was in April at the pandemic’s peak, when daily deaths would often surpass 2,000. By early July, the death toll had declined to a low of about 400. But as people resumed normal, pre-pandemic activities throughout the summer, new cases and deaths rose, especially..."
"Sarah Palin has endorsed Donald Trump in the crowded Republican primary field, his campaign confirmed today.
The former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential candidate was a key supporter of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2012 Senate bid. But this cycle, the leading Tea Party voice has been mulling an endorsement of Trump, the frontrunner in national 2016 polls."
"CNN has issued an apology for playing a song titled “Stupid Girls before a segment about Sarah Palin.

"This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will question Neil Gorsuch about the judiciary’s role. Herewith some pertinent questions: – Lincoln’s greatness began with his recoil from the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act, which empowered residents of those territories to decide whether to have slavery. The act’s premise was that “popular sovereignty” — majorities’ rights — is the essence of the American project. Is it, or is liberty?"
"President Donald Trump has reportedly signed the $900 billion coronavirus stimulus bill and the $1.4 trillion spending bill thus averting a potential government shutdown.
Sources told Axios that Trump will sign the current bill, which provides for $600 checks for most Americans, and will then will continue to push for that amount to be brought up to the $2,000 that he demanded last week. The Washington Post reported similar news that Trump would sign the bill into law, but cautioned that the situation remained fluid because Trump had “repeatedly changed..."

And he’ll talk about gun control.
CBS News announced on Sunday morning that they would stream Obama’s “urgent address to the nation on gun control at 8 PM ET.” So Obama won’t be talking about the nature of radical Islam; he won’t be talking about law enforcement failures, or how to keep us safe. No, he’ll tell us about how disarming ourselves will somehow keep..."
"The Justice Department pursued a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago because investigators suspected that former president Trump and his associates relocated and hid highly classified records, despite claiming that they returned such privileged information to the government, a Tuesday court filing from the department reveals.
The filing came amid Trump’s petition for a special master to conduct an independent review of materials seized from his residence, a motion which a judge said that she has “preliminary intent” to grant but which the DOJ opposes, citing potential injury to national security interests.

"The Washington Post scrubbed an unflattering anecdote of Vice President Kamala Harris crassly laughing at the thought of a prisoner begging for a drink of water — then backtracked Friday after an eagle-eyed reporter took notice.
Harris made the comments in a July 2019 Washington Post profile about her relationship with her sister and trusted aide, Maya Harris, when the former California prosecutor was running for president.
But that story disappeared from the site — with its link redirecting to a newer version published on Jan. 11, sans anecdote."
"When The Washington Post published a 2019 campaign trail feature about then-presidential hopeful Kamala Harris' close relationship with her sister, it opened with a memorable anecdote in which Harris bizarrely compared the rigors of the campaign trail to…life behind bars.
And then proceeded to laugh—at the idea of an inmate begging for a sip of water."
"The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in October as unemployment fell to 4.6% and 531,000 new jobs were added to payrolls, the Labor Department announced Friday.
Both numbers outperformed estimates. Dow Jones estimated that unemployment would drop to 4.7% and 450,000 jobs created.
The unemployment rate is the lowest level since March 2020.
The report is welcome news for President Biden, after voters this week said the economy was among the top reasons Republicans did better than expected in state elections.

"It's a good day in America, maybe a rare, good day. We're going to celebrate no matter what. Here's the context for why it's good—censorship. Censorship is essentially the hallmark of neoliberalism. Have you noticed that? Our leaders seem to spend a lot more time trying to control what we say and think than trying to improve our country and that means that anyone who orders the wrong words, even accidentally, gets fired or banned or ostracized or even charged with a crime. We've seen that, too. We don't need..."
"The Supreme Court has struck down New York’s century-old law restricting the carrying of concealed firearms, its first major Second Amendment decision in more than a decade and a ruling that could lead to more guns on the streets.
Writing for the 6-3 majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said Thursday that the law’s requirement of New Yorkers who want a permit to carry a handgun in public to show “proper cause” that the weapon is specifically needed for self-defense “violates the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising..."
"A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted Thursday to endorse Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine and recommended that the agency move forward with emergency authorization.
In a 20-0 vote, with one abstention, the panel found that the safety and efficacy of the vaccine outweigh the risks for use in people age 18 and older, marking the penultimate step in the approval process."
"At last, light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel: At least two highly effective vaccines should begin distribution before year’s end.
Moderna this week followed Pfizer in announcing plans to have a vaccine on the market by the end of December, and other companies are likely to soon follow.

"The liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ruled the Trump administration's decision to withhold Title X funding from medical facilities that provide abortion is constitutional. Their decision overturned preliminary injunctions issued by lower courts in three different states, Fox News reported.
The Title X rule was first enacted in 1970, which prohibited taxpayer-funded abortions as ""a method of family planning."" During President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1988, ""merely provid[ing] counseling or referrals for abortion for family-planning purposes"" fell under this limitation.

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued its latest report assessing the state of the climate and projecting its future. As usual, the media and politicians are exaggerating and distorting the evidence in the report.

"Politico has fun recalling the many bad predictions from politicians and television pundits throughout the course of 2020.
It’s worth noting that a few predictions Politico selected aren’t quite as off-base as the others. The impeachment of President Trump did not cost Democrats the House, as Jeanine Pirro predicted, but Democrats lost seats and the impeachment certainly didn’t help Nancy Pelosi’s majority. Trump didn’t no-show the debates with Biden, as Amy Siskind predicted, but he did end up refusing to participate in one debate that the commission wanted to hold..."
"A Biden administration economic official credited President Joe Biden’s policies for a recent decrease in gas prices despite the fact that the fall in prices is largely due to diminished demand and fears of a global recession, according to a CNBC news clip posted to Twitter.

VERDICT: FALSE. Trump spoke about experimental UV light technologies. Biden keeps repeating the same false claim.

If you ask vast numbers of both conservative and liberal Americans what word comes to mind when they hear Donald Trump’s name, the response is immediate: “Authoritarian.” In fact, if there is one theme that has remained constant in mainstream coverage of Trump ever since he surged to the top of Republican primary polls in 2015, it’s that he has authoritarian tendencies. He seeks power, and he..."
"The 18-year long reign of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) has finally come to an end in Louisiana. In a landslide victory in Saturday’s runoff election, Republican Bill Cassidy defeated the incumbent and captured the ninth Senate seat for the GOP, capping off a victorious midterm election for his party. Cassidy pulled in 56 percent of the vote, to Landrieu's 44 percent.
The road was rocky for Landrieu from the start. The public found out about her improper use of taxpayer funds, then the fact she doesn’t even own a..."
"Andrew Gillum was caught in a room with more than just drugs.
The man who overdosed on crystal meth in a Florida hotel room with Gillum, a Democrat who made an unsuccessful bid for Florida governor, was an openly gay male escort with a profile on the website RentMen.com, Florida’s Local10 reported Friday."
"If there was one moment from Tuesday’s Republican National Convention that sent liberals over the edge, it was during one of President Trump’s appearances with Acting Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf when he oversaw a naturalization ceremony at the White House to highlight legal immigration to the United States.
Wolf gave the oath of allegiance to five individuals from Ghana, India, Sudan, Lebanon, and Bolivia as the president stood to the side and watched.
""You followed the rules, you obeyed the laws, you learned our history, embraced our values,..."
"As chilling details continue to emerge about the Muslim couple who unleashed carnage in Southern California Wednesday morning, storming a social services office in tactical gear and killing 14 with assault rifles before dying hours later in a fiery shootout with police, speculation mounted that the pair left their ""IED factory"" home hellbent for jihad."
"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has found evidence that an FBI lawyer manipulated a key investigative document related to the FBI's secretive surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser -- enough to change the substantive meaning of the document, according to multiple reports.
The show-stopping development comes as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News that Horowitz's comprehensive report on allegations of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant abuse against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page will be released on Dec. 9. ""That's locked,"" Graham said."
"A defiant Kentucky county clerk, who has been ordered to face a federal judge on Thursday in a hearing about her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, says she won't resign.
“Some people have said I should resign, but I have done my job well,” Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis said in a statement posted to the website of the lawfirm that represents her, Liberty Counsel.
“I never imagined a day like this would come, where I would be asked to violate a central teaching of Scripture and..."
"The southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, has been almost entirely destroyed by Russian troops, according to Ukrainian officials Sunday.
Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CBS that Mariupol “doesn’t exist anymore,” after seven weeks of attacks from Russian forces. “The remainings of the Ukrainian army and large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces. They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost,” he continued.
At least 21,0000 people..."
"The year 2021 has seen President Biden and congressional Democrats explore, very publicly and painfully, seemingly every possible way to squeeze more tax money out of the American people. This exploration has taken place though the federal government just enjoyed the biggest revenue haul in two decades, inflation is higher than it’s been in three decades, and Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) has taken all tax-rate increases off the table.
Desperate for any new tax at this late hour of the “Build Back Better” soap opera of socialism, all hands have come on deck for perhaps the..."
"The Senate voted 52-48 on Monday night to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in a move that makes the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judge and Notre Dame law professor the third appointment to the high court by President Trump, solidifying his administration's legacy even further just a week before Election Day as he seeks a second term."
"Disney confirmed in a statement to Axios it will change Hulu’s advertising policies to allow political advertising. The decision comes only two days after the company denied ads created by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Association. The denial had sparked online outrage among Democrats.
The ads that prompted internet outcry depict congressional Republicans and former president Donald Trump as unfeeling about gun violence toward children and accuses them of a ""coordinated Republican attack"" on abortion.
This is the latest political controversy in which Disney has caved to Democratic pressure. Last March, Disney opposed Governor Ron..."
"Donald Trump’s lawyers will wrap up their arguments on Tuesday in the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of the Republican president after attacking Democrat Joe Biden but shrugging off disclosures from a former top White House adviser.
In about seven hours of arguments before the Senate on Monday, Trump’s lawyers largely ignored revelations in an unpublished manuscript by John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, that go to the heart of impeachment charges against Trump.
Trump’s lawyers said they would continue their presentations on Tuesday. It was not clear when senators..."
"CLAIM: Debate moderator Chris Wallace implied that President Donald Trump never condemned white supremacists.
VERDICT: FALSE. President Trump has done so repeatedly, despite what Wallace — and Joe Biden — have suggested.
During the first presidential debate, Wallace challenged President Trump to condemn white supremacists. It was an astonishingly ill-informed — and inflammatory — challenge, and repeated a lie that Biden has told frequently in the campaign.
Trump has condemned white supremacists repeatedly.
As Breitbart News noted in a recent fact check:
ABC News fact-checked Biden, and noted — commendably..."
"It ought to be hard to believe — but, alas, it’s not — that with the border disintegrating and with it our security and sovereignty, the Biden administration and Washington Democrats are prioritizing . . . yes . . . wait for it . . . ghost guns!
I had the chance to discuss this on Fox News this morning with Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer. “Ghost gun” is the term applied to a firearm that is DYI-assembled from components often sold in a kit. The anti-gun folk are alarmed about ghost guns because they don’t have serial numbers and..."
"DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach said Donald Trump, if he’s elected president, would help the U.S. economy recover by going further into debt, just as Ronald Reagan fueled growth in the 1980s.
“Trump is going to win, and Trump is going to increase the deficit,” Gundlach said during a panel discussion Thursday in New York. Reagan “did it by taking three or four decades of stable nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratio and putting it on a hockey stick higher.”"
"The main drag through downtown Charlotte looked a bit like Times Square on Sunday night, as revelers and out-of-towners converged to gawk at the flashing city around them.
The electric scene before the start of the Democratic National Convention belies the trouble under the surface.
For Democrats, North Carolina was an awkward choice and represents some of the challenges President Obama faces this Election Day.
Unemployment here is at 9.6 percent, well above the national average. The governor of the state, Democrat Bev Perdue, was rated as..."
"The chief executives of several major US airlines and shipping firms have warned that a planned rollout of 5G service could have “catastrophic” consequences for travelers and commerce.
The CEOs demanded “immediate intervention” from the government before planes are grounded by the 5G service set to be deployed by AT&T and Verizon on Wednesday.
“Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded,” read the letter signed by the CEOs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines,..."
"This week, well over 1,000 rockets have been launched into Israel by Palestinian terrorists operating out of Gaza. The rockets have been aimed at schools, at Israeli civilians in the highly populated Tel Aviv area, and — in a major escalation — at Ben Gurion Airport, which connects Israel with the outside world.
Due to the incredible performance of its Iron Dome missile-defense system, Israel has been able to minimize its casualties. But because no system is perfect, and with Hamas and Islamic Jihad launching hundreds of missiles simultaneously, some..."
"Two columns of Russian tanks have entered Ukraine, a security spokesman says, forcing border guards to retreat amid fears that rebels are seeking to create a land link between Russia and Crimea.
Ukrainian security council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko says Ukrainian forces were fired at using Grad missile systems from Russian territory at about 11 a.m."
"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats introduced Tuesday the text to their $3 trillion coronavirus relief package, which includes a massive tax break for the rich.
According to reports and the text, the “Heroes Act” gives $100,000 on average to people who make more than $1 million a year. The House Democrats’ 1,815-page package repeals the $10,000 state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, which allows taxpayers in high-tax states to deduct local tax payments on federal tax returns."
"Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Thursday that the Justice Department requested permission from the federal court to unseal the court-approved search warrant that authorized its raid on former President Donald Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago.
""This matter plainly 'concerns public officials or public concerns' ... as it involves a law enforcement action taken at the property of the 45th President of the United States,"" the DOJ said in the filing. ""The public's clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred under these circumstances weighs heavily in favor of unsealing.""
""The government hereby requests that the Court..."
"Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he has plans to give 40,000 factory jobs to Central American migrants in Mexico.
“This agreement is going to be signed, there will be no legal problem,” he said Friday. “We are arranging this so that they can be hired without much processing.”
Such a deal would provide a solution to some of the tens of thousands of migrants who are seeking asylum in the U.S. but have been sent back into Mexico as they await court dates on their asylum claims."
"The White House budget office on Tuesday urged Congress to spend more than $30 billion to fund natural disaster aid and the resettlement of Afghan refugees as part of a stopgap bill to avoid a government shutdown.
The White House is seeking $14 billion in aid to address natural disasters that occurred before Hurricane Ida and another $6.4 billion to cover the cost of relocating tens of thousands Afghans who assisted the U.S. over the past 20 years.
In addition, the administration said it expects to ask Congress for another $10..."
"The House passed a resolution condemning the conspiracy theory movement known as QAnon, but 17 Republicans and Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian, voted against it.
H.R. 1154 passed on Friday 371-18, with one person voting present. QAnon is a right-wing conspiracy group that believes, among other things, that a group of powerful politicians is involved in a child sex-trafficking ring.
Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia was one of those who voted nay but later explained on Twitter that he did so unintentionally and instead meant to vote yea.
In..."
