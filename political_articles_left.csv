The Guardian,Left,"**""Itís OK to feel despair at Trumpís victory. The important thing is not to give up""** by Polly Toynbee, published November 7, 2024
","
With wailing woe in the small hours, many of you shared that wrenching despair when the US election result extinguished hope. Beyond reason, beyond reckoning, a nation that was once the beacon of the democratic world has knowingly elected a dangerous, racist demagogue, a ‚Äúpussy-grabbing‚Äù criminal who tried to overthrow the government, a wild conspiracy spreader, a squalid, reckless beast of fathomless vanity and corruption. Caligula, Commodus, Nero, Domitian ‚Ä¶ This is the way a civilisation dies: by suicide not murder.

Donald Trump could now command both houses of Congress and the supreme court, with no steadying countervailing instinct for national self-preservation. ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù means no allies, no ‚Äúspecial relationships‚Äù, tariffs for all. Encourage Russia to ‚Äúdo whatever the hell they want‚Äù, Nato be damned. He will send in the military to force mass deportations of millions of migrants. He threatens the justice system with revenge, with protesters and opponents branded ‚Äúthe enemy within‚Äù. This democratically elected self-described ‚Äúdictator‚Äù can do whatever he wants. And the tides will carry this poison across the Atlantic, invigorating Europe‚Äôs hard right from Nigel Farage to Viktor Orb√°n, Geert Wilders to Marine Le Pen, the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland to the Sweden Democrats.

On the morning of the result I was speaking to US students visiting the UK from Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Jersey. One had her head bowed, sighing. Another told me she had wept. They were mainly liberals, the sort who might choose a semester in Europe, and were distressed at how many fellow students had not voted. ‚ÄúMy Republican uncle lives up the road, but we don‚Äôt speak, not since he had Obama toilet paper when we visited at Thanksgiving. He genuinely believes Kamala is a street walker.‚Äù They talk of abortion rights and deep dark misogyny: ‚ÄúAmerican men will not vote for a woman,‚Äù one said, and others agreed. Trump voters live across a divide for ever unbridgeable to them. How can this be happening, they want to know. How can civilisation be so fragile?

But enough of this, before I rant myself to lunacy, fearing a dark future for children and grandchildren. Is it wise or useful to feel a political event as such a visceral, gut-punching personal calamity? Pollsters remind us that most normal people most of the time think little about politics. Asked ‚ÄúHow often, if at all, do you discuss government and politics with others‚Äù, 30% say never, 19% a few times a month, 19% less often, leaving 32% at a few times a week and 10% nearly every day. Political obsessives (you and me, Guardian readers) are odd. If you live and breathe it, if you see the world and everything that happens through a political and sociological lens, you are unusual. Many others can travel through life thinking only of family, work and friends without much curiosity about who is governing, how and why, beyond perhaps a distant dislike.

Out canvassing you find plenty who say they don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù, as if it were a hobby for a few and not a citizen‚Äôs duty nor a question of self-interest. I resist the instinct to shake some sense into them. I do say that ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù is everything: the ambulance or police car that does or doesn‚Äôt arrive, the quality of your air and water, safety of your food or medicines, tax you pay, pensions you draw, the streets and parks, the arts, sports stadiums ‚Äì and the fairness of how we live. I usually expect a laconic shrug.

Is that a better way to be for your own sanity? Life on the left is a long and often unhappy journey through dashed hopes and deep disappointments, elections lost and lost again. The people will insist on making the wrong choices at the ballot box ‚Äì perverse, nonsensical and against their own interests. Once in a while all that losing gets punctuated by a burst of radiant sunlight when the left occasionally wins ‚Äì in Britain in my lifetime in 1964, 1974, 1997 and this good year. But when they do succeed, watch how many on the left prefer to get their disillusion in early when their government fails to fix everything all at once, veers off course or compromises with the voters.

The Brexit referendum result felt like a shutter falling across the country, dividing us as never before, while casting us adrift from the mainland of our home continent. I found it hard enough then to inhabit the mind of Brexit voters who had done this to us, but to think yourself into the impenetrable Trump-voting psyche is 100 times harder. No, this is not just ‚Äúmetropolitan elite‚Äù obtuseness: the other side is equally uncomprehending.

Not long before he died, I had a long conversation with the economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who said research shows that those on the left are much less happy than those on the right: US Republicans have always outscored Democrats on the happiness scale. I can see why seething outrage at social injustice and indignation at reactionary governments that defend the interests of the rich against the chances of children is not a pathway to contentment. In comparison, look at the easeful life of complacent conservatism, perched like a Cheshire cat beaming down from the high branches of power.

Would it be better to give up all this angst and agonising and arguing? Let things be? Do the gardening, try gourmet cooking, re-read classics of yesteryear, forget whatever public realm lies beyond the immediate horizon of your own small sphere. No, of course not. There is no escaping the danger of Trumpism, only escapism. The unexamined life is not worth living, said Socrates, and that applies equally to the unexamined society in which we live. And when you do examine it, action is required. Each time, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again confronting the forces of conservatism. The more vicious they become now, the greater the duty to resist. ‚ÄúNever give up,‚Äù said the vanquished and exhausted Kamala Harris.

New York Times,Left,"ìThe Republican Party Is a Threat to Democracyî - Published in The New York Times on March 20, 2025.
","The word ìdemocracyî never appears in the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.
However, democracy is central to the modern concept of America.
The founders seemed to prefer calling the burgeoning country a Republic rather than a democracy. Many were opposed to direct democracy and the possibility that demagogues could corrupt it or mob rule could overtake it. They instead designed a representative government in which ìthe peopleî would elect representatives who would make the laws and conduct the governance.
The problem, or course, was that their definition of ìthe peopleî was largely limited to wealthy white men, enslavers among them.
Over the years, America has expanded the definition of ìthe peopleî to include more Americans, but conservatives have resisted the expansion at every turn. And now, they are trying to drag the country backward, to pare down the ranks of those who can vote and to deny or invalidate elections in which voting populations, not yet pared down enough, deliver results with which they disagree.
We keep hearing people say that candidates, like some of the ones competing in Tuesdayís primaries, threaten our democracy. We heard during the Jan. 6 hearings about threats to our democracy. We have heard for years that Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy.
But it seems to me that we have to take a step back and realize that the current Republican Party has abandoned the idea of a full democracy.
Republicans want to revert the country to the way the founders conceived of it, when white men had outsize influence, when patriarchy prevailed, when white supremacy masqueraded as conventional wisdom.
Liberals often seem to me overly vexed by why Republicans donít recognize the threat that Trumpís election denialism poses. The reason is clear to me: They have turned their backs on democracy.
For anti-democracy Republicans, Trump is an incredibly useful tool. His motivations are selfish and small, but the Republicans balking at full democracy have plans that are grand. They see themselves falling into a minority, so they want to devise a plan for minority rule.
And they are attacking the electoral process at every level to realize their goals.
By calling themselves traditionalist and constitutionalist, and by canonizing the flawed founders, they disguise their regression as preservation.
Conservatives now routinely make the point that America isnít a democracy, but a Republic. The Heritage Foundation even published a report in 2020 entitled ìAmerica Is a Republic, Not a Democracy.î The report argued, ìThe contemporary efforts to weaken our republican customs and institutions in the name of greater equality thus run against the efforts by Americaís Founders to defend our country from the potential excesses of democratic majorities,î and that the American system of government is ìthreatened by an egalitarianism that undermines the social, familial, religious, and economic distinctions and inequalities that undergird our political liberty.î
In their telling, the will of the majority itself seems to be a problem. I interpret this broadly: that a fuller democracy is, in the view of many conservatives, a disaster waiting to happen.
So we are seeing an epic clash playing out in America in which the parameters are not being fully, loudly delineated: The Democrats want a democracy; the Republicans donít. The Republican Party is anti-democracy, post-democracy. While Democrats are screaming about a collapsing country, Republicans are already surveying the landscape of the America that will emerge from the wreckage.
George Thomas, a professor at Claremont McKenna College, argued in The Atlantic in 2020 that although the word ìdemocracyî may not be in the Constitution, the spirit of it is. As he put it: ìHigh-minded claims that we are not a democracy surreptitiously fuse republic with minority rule rather than popular government. Enabling sustained minority rule at the national level is not a feature of our constitutional design, but a perversion of it.î
Perversion, distortion and deceit now appear to be the spine of the Republican Party. It is no longer a party of ideas, but rather a party of atavism. It is a party frantically running down an ascending escalator.
The problem is that there is a real risk that the party will succeed in bringing the country down with it.
As Sue Halpern has written in The New Yorker, ìThe paradox of American democracy is that its survival is a choice; it persists solely at the discretion of an electorate that can, if it so wills, dismantle it.î Republicans are pushing the portion of the electorate they control to dismantle it."
